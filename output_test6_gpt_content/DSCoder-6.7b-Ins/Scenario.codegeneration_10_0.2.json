        "question_content": "In the distant kingdom of Arraya, there exists a winding road of N enchanted stones, each with a secret number inscribed upon it. These numbers, known only to the wise, determine the magical energy running through the land. The King of Arraya, ever a perfectionist, wishes for harmony\u2014a state where each stone\u2019s number is no less than the one before it, ensuring a smooth, non-decreasing flow of magic. However, time and fate have rendered the numbers uneven, sometimes causing the energy to stumble and falter.\n\nTo restore order, the King has entrusted you, the Royal Enchanter, with a special power: for each sequence of adjacent stones\u2014be it a single stone or a stretch running from any starting point to any ending point along the road\u2014you may cast up to K spells of enhancement. Each spell can increase the number on any single stone within that chosen stretch by one, and you may distribute your K spells as you see fit among the stones of that stretch. Yet, the magic behaves peculiarly: each time you pick a different stretch, previous enhancements vanish, and you must begin anew, considering each stretch in splendid isolation.\n\nThe question for you is this: for how many stretches along the road, if you use your K spells wisely, can you guarantee that the numbers from start to end never decrease? In other words, for how many possible segments of contiguous stones can you, with the allowed K enchantments, transform the numbers into a gentle, non-decreasing melody? Your challenge is to count all such stretches\u2014using your magic as efficiently as possible, and ensuring that you do not miss a single opportunity for harmony.\n\n**How messages from the King will arrive and how your response must be written:**  \nAt dawn, a scroll arrives bearing two things: first, the list of N numbers (the current magical values of the stones, in the order they appear); second, the number K, representing the maximum spells you may use for any single stretch. You must return but a single number: the count of all possible stretches where your magic can restore harmony, as described above.\n\n**For instance,** when a message arrives stating that the stones bear the numbers `[6, 3, 1, 2, 4, 4]` and you may use 7 spells per stretch, your answer should be **17**. This is because, among the 21 possible stretches, only four cannot be made harmonious, despite your best efforts with 7 spells. In another case, if the numbers are `[6, 3, 1, 3, 6]` and K is 4, your answer should be **12**: you find that all one-stone stretches, all two-stone stretches, and all but one three-stone stretch can be corrected, plus one longer stretch\u2014all adding up to 12.\n\nThus, the fate of the kingdom\u2019s harmony lies in your hands. List the magical numbers of the stones and your spell limit, and reveal: **how many ways can the road\u2019s magic be set to flow ever onward, never backward, through your enchantments?**",

        "question_content": "In the distant city of Gridlock, a mechanical hero named Circuit was entrusted with a vital mission: to traverse the city\u2019s vast rectangular districts in order to collect as much wealth as possible for the struggling townsfolk. Each district, represented by a tidy square on the city\u2019s secret blueprint, either offered a bounty of coins or harbored a lurking bandit eager to rob passersby. The city\u2019s planners designated the city\u2019s dimensions with two mystical numbers\u2014let\u2019s call them N (the number of avenues from north to south), and M (the number of streets from west to east). The size of the city was immense, but never exceeded 500 blocks in either direction.\n\nCircuit always began his journey at the northwest corner, and his goal was to reach the southeast exit. Moving through the city, Circuit could only head east or south at every step\u2014retracing his path or moving diagonally was forbidden by the city\u2019s ancient laws. Upon entering each district, Circuit would either collect the number of coins left behind by grateful citizens (if the district\u2019s value was nonnegative), or lose coins to a sly bandit (if the value was negative; the bandit would steal coins equal to the absolute value of the signposted number).\n\nLuckily, Circuit was equipped with a rare and precious technology: the Bandit Neutralizer. This device could render up to two bandits along his path harmless, allowing him to pass through their districts without losing any coins at all. However, he had to choose carefully\u2014he could only use this device twice during his journey, and only in the districts where bandits lurked.\n\nThe task for any master tactician reading these plans is simple yet profound: determine how many coins Circuit can gather\u2014at most\u2014by the time he reaches the city\u2019s farthest corner, using his Bandit Neutralizer judiciously. The city\u2019s blueprint would be provided as an N-by-M grid, where each cell listed the coin value (positive or negative) of its corresponding district. Craft the route so that Circuit\u2019s fortune is maximized, taking full advantage of his two neutralizations if necessary.\n\nWhen providing the city\u2019s layout, the record-keepers expect the following order: first, two numbers indicating the number of avenues (N) and streets (M); then N lines, each with M numbers, representing the coin (or bandit) value of each district, from the top row to the bottom. The answer should be a single number: the greatest total wealth Circuit can amass following the rules above.\n\nTo bring this challenge to life, consider these two chronicles from the city\u2019s archives:\n\n*In one instance, the blueprint was as follows:*\n```\n3 3\n0 1 -1\n1 -2 3\n2 -3 4\n```\n*Here, Circuit began with empty pockets, gathered a coin, cleverly avoided a fierce bandit using his first neutralization, and amassed further riches to end with a fortune of 8 coins\u2014the optimal bounty.*\n\n*In another tale, the city was a haven of generosity:*\n```\n2 3\n10 10 10\n10 10 10\n```\n*Circuit collected coins in every district, finishing with a staggering 40 coins\u2014the best possible haul.*\n\nThus, the fate of Gridlock\u2019s fortune rests in your hands. Can you chart Circuit\u2019s path through the city to maximize his wealth, deftly outwitting bandits and leveraging his limited powers with perfect skill?",

The dp array stores the maximum amount of coins that can be collected up to the current cell. The dp array is initialized with the first cell's value. Then, for each cell, the maximum amount of coins that can be collected is the maximum of the amount of coins in the cell above or to the left, plus the coin value in the current cell. If the total amount of coins is negative, it is set to 0. The function returns the value in the last cell of the dp array, which is the maximum amount of coins that can be collected.\n",

The base case is `dp[0][0]`, which is the maximum of `coins[0][0]` and `0`.\n\nThen, for each cell in the first row and first column, it calculates the maximum amount of coins that can be collected by either staying in the current cell or moving to the right or down.\n\nFinally, it fills the rest of the `dp` table by calculating the maximum amount of coins that can be collected by either moving to the right or down from the current cell, and by adding the current cell's coin value. The result is the value in the bottom-right cell of the `dp` table.\n",

If the coin value at the current cell is nonnegative, it updates the current cell's value by adding the maximum value from the previous row and the previous column.

        "question_content": "In the ancient kingdom of Verdania, a sprawling world-tree named Yggdrasil stood at the heart of the land. Its roots and branches formed a vast network, with each junction\u2014known as a Life Node\u2014housing a unique denizen whose soul glowed with a secret number. The origin of all branches was the Prime Node at the center, marked by the number zero, from which every path unfurled.\n\nVerdanian scholars mapped Yggdrasil meticulously, using scrolls called the Edges: each scroll recorded a trio\u2014two connected nodes and the mystical length of their link. For every resident, their soul number was inscribed in the Numstone, so that the worth of each node was ever known and none mistaken for another. The kingdom\u2019s caretakers decreed that there must be exactly one less scroll than the number of nodes\u2014no more, no less\u2014lest the structure wobble. No two scrolls spoke of the same connection twice, and every length in a scroll was always a positive integer no greater than one thousand. Each node\u2019s number, too, could be any non-negative integer up to 50,000 in value, as the soul\u2019s hues were broad and varied.\n\nBut a peculiar challenge arose. The Verdanians revered \u201cSpecial Pilgrimages\u201d: a wanderer\u2019s journey from an elder node down through its descendants, never moving upwards, and treading only on nodes whose soul numbers were all unique along the way\u2014no number may repeat or the pilgrimage lost its sanctity. Remarkably, a pilgrimage could be as short as standing on a single node, for stillness was respected as much as movement.\n\nThe High Council sought a champion capable of discovering, throughout Yggdrasil, two truths: First, what was the greatest possible total length that could be walked upon such a special pilgrimage, beginning at any node and always proceeding downward? Second, among all the longest such pilgrimages, what was the smallest number of nodes needed to achieve that maximal length? The champion\u2019s findings were to be sent in the form of a pair: first, the maximal pilgrimage length in units of distance, and second, the minimal node count required to achieve this length.\n\nTo grant such a champion the tools for their quest, the Council presented two artifacts as input:  \n- The Edges Scroll, listing all pathways as groups of three numbers: the starting node, the ending node, and the path\u2019s length.  \n- The Numstone Array, showing the soul number for every node in order.  \nBoth artifacts must be consulted together to unearth the answers. The champion must then present, as output, two numbers separated by a space: the highest pilgrimage length possible, and the smallest number of nodes required for such a journey.\n\nFor instance, if the Edges Scroll read `[[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,5],[1,4,4],[2,5,6]]` and the Numstone listed `[2,1,2,1,3,1]`, the champion would find that the greatest sacred pilgrimage length was 6 units, and that this feat required at least 2 nodes\u2014perhaps by following the path from node 2 to node 5, or from node 0 to node 1 to node 4, for both honor the rules.  \nBut if the Edges Scroll was simpler\u2014just `[[1,0,8]]`\u2014and the Numstone simply `[2,2]`, then the best pilgrimage could only be a solitary stand upon one node, as no longer journey was sacred, yielding a maximal length of 0 and a minimal count of 1.\n\nIn this way, all the constraints of the Verdanians\u2019 mystical world-tree are honored: exactly one less scroll than there are nodes, every connection valid, and every number in its place. So, champion, will you accept the Council\u2019s summons and help the kingdom discover the most exalted special pilgrimage in all of Verdania?",

It keeps track of the maximum depth and the smallest number of nodes required to achieve this depth. The DFS is implemented recursively, with the current path passed as a set to avoid revisiting nodes. The function `longestSpecialPath` initializes the maximum depth and the smallest number of nodes, and then calls the DFS function on each node. The function `dfs` updates the maximum depth and the smallest number of nodes if the current path is longer or has the same length as the maximum depth. It then calls the DFS function on each unvisited neighbor of the current node.\n",

For each node, it recursively calculates the longest and second longest paths that start from the current node and end at a node with a different number. The result is the maximum of these two lengths plus one (for the current node). If the current path is longer than the current maximum, it updates the result.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, because each node is visited exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n), because of the space required for the graph and the recursive call stack.\n",

The DFS function takes as input the graph, the list of node numbers, the current node, the current depth, and the current path. The path is represented as a set to ensure that no number is repeated.\n\nIn each DFS call, the function first checks if the current depth is greater than the maximum depth found so far. If it is, the function updates the maximum depth and the number of nodes in the path. If the current depth is equal to the maximum depth and the number of nodes in the path is less than the minimum found so far, the function updates the minimum number of nodes.\n\nThe function then calls the DFS function on all neighbors of the current node. The depth is incremented by 1 and the neighbor's number is added to the path. The function uses the bitwise OR operator to combine the current path with the neighbor's number. This is because the bitwise OR operator returns a number whose bits are set in either of the operands, but not both. In this case, it ensures that no number is repeated in the path.\n\nFinally, the function returns the maximum depth and the minimum number of nodes as the result.\n",

For each node, it checks all of its neighbors. If the neighbor has a different number than the current node, it adds 1 to the path length and 1 to the node count. The function `dfs` returns a list of two elements: the maximum path length and the minimum node count. The solution then updates the result if the current node has not been visited. Finally, it returns the result.\n",

Within its marble halls, Librarians guard scrolls inscribed with all the words and phrases ever spoken or imagined. Among their most enigmatic tasks is the Ritual of Pattern Seeking\u2014a challenge passed down through generations, undertaken whenever the Council wishes to uncover hidden connections within the Great Chronicle, the world\u2019s ever-growing historical text.\n\nThe Ritual centers around two scrolls: the Chronicle Scroll, inscribed with a lengthy sequence of ancient runes (let us call its length N), and the Pattern Scroll, containing a unique incantation interspersed with exactly two Mystic Sigils\u2014glyphs represented by twin stars known as the Mark of Infinity. The rules of Verbatim magic dictate that each Mark of Infinity can embody any sequence of runes, even none at all, for in this world, absence is as potent as presence. However, aside from these sigils, the rest of the Pattern Scroll\u2019s runes must align in perfect order with a continuous segment\u2014a substring\u2014somewhere within the Chronicle.\n\nThe task bestowed upon the questing Librarian is this: Seek out the briefest passage in the Chronicle Scroll that the Pattern Scroll\u2019s magic may fully encompass, honoring the exact placement of its runes and both Marks of Infinity. If no such passage exists, the Librarian must report failure\u2014otherwise, they must record the length of the shortest eligible passage found. Efficiency is prized in Verbatim, for the Chronicle Scroll can be up to ten to the power of five runes long, and the Pattern Scroll can be just as vast, though never shorter than two runes due to the presence of the twin sigils. Every rune in both scrolls is a simple character from the ancient script\u2014lowercase, orderly, and unembellished.\n\nWhen a Librarian receives their assignment, it arrives thus: First, the Chronicle Scroll is presented on a single line\u2014a string of runes. Next, the Pattern Scroll follows, provided on the second line, also as a string. The Librarian\u2019s answer must be concise: a single number written on a line, signifying the length of the most fleeting passage that conjures the Pattern\u2019s magic within the Chronicle\u2014or, if the spell cannot be cast, the number negative one to mark impossibility.\n\nTo illuminate the Ritual further, the Council offers tales from past searches:\n- When the Chronicle Scroll read as *abaacbaecebce* and the Pattern Scroll as *ba*c*ce*, the shortest conjurable passage was *baecebce*, a segment eight runes long.\n- If the Chronicle Scroll was *baccbaadbc* and the Pattern Scroll read *cc*baa*adb*, no spell could be formed\u2014the answer was negative one.\n- Should the Chronicle Scroll contain only a single rune, *a*, and the Pattern Scroll be composed solely of the two Marks of Infinity, *\\*\\**,* then the empty passage sufficed, its length being zero.\n- In another trial, with *madlogic* as the Chronicle and *\\*adlogi\\** as Pattern, the swiftest magic converged on *adlogi*, a sequence of six.\n\nThus, the Librarians of Verbatim continue their Ritual, forever seeking the briefest whisper of pattern in the endless song of the Chronicle\u2019s past.",

The solution first counts the occurrence of each character in the pattern and the string. Then it iterates over the string, incrementing the count of each character as it encounters it. If the count of a character in the string is less than or equal to the count in the pattern, it means the character is present in the pattern and we decrement the `missing_char` count. When `missing_char` becomes zero, it means we have found a valid substring. We then try to minimize the window by moving the start pointer to the right. If the current window size is smaller than the minimum window size found so far, we update the minimum window size and the start index. If no valid substring is found, the function returns -1.\n",

The rolling hash is a technique used in computer science to efficiently compute the hash of a string or a substring. It works by computing the hash of the first substring, then updating the hash by removing the first character and adding the next character, which is a constant time operation.\n\nThe solution first computes the hash of the pattern and the first m characters of the string. If the hash matches and the substrings match, it returns the length of the pattern.\n\nThen it iterates over the rest of the string, updating the hash and checking if the hash matches and the substrings match.

The window is expanded until it contains all characters of the pattern. When the window contains all characters, it is contracted from the left until it no longer contains all characters. This process is repeated until the entire string has been scanned. The smallest window found is the shortest matching substring.\n",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeralis, residents communicate not with words, but with sequences of glowing glyphs\u2014numbers etched in light across the night sky. Every evening, the Council of Calculation presents a grand glyph string, a sequence of symbols that holds secrets and stories. The city\u2019s tradition is governed by a peculiar but unyielding custom: the meaning and worth of each segment within a sequence must be measured by a test known as the \"Tail-End Trial.\"\n\nAccording to Numeralis law, a segment\u2014a stretch of consecutive glyphs plucked from the grand sequence\u2014may only be declared \"worthy\" if, when its entire value is tallied (as one would read a number), it can be perfectly divided by the glyph that stands at its end. However, whispers in the city tell that the glyph representing the void (zero) lacks the authority to judge; any segment ending in such a glyph is immediately disregarded from the trial, for division by nothingness is forbidden.\n\nEvery cycle, the Council faces a challenge: For a given string of glyphs displayed above the city, they must determine precisely how many segments shine with worthiness under the Tail-End Trial. Residents know that while a segment may begin with the insignificance of leading zeros, all that matters is its strength at the end\u2014its final glyph and its capacity for perfect division. The city values not only the answer, but the elegance of reaching it as swiftly and completely as possible, for sequences can soar to dizzying lengths, up to N glyphs, where N might be any number up to ten raised to the fifth power.\n\nWhen the Council raises a sequence, they announce it in this formal manner:  \n**Input:** a string of glyphs, each one a digit from zero to nine, arrayed in order.  \n**Output:** a single number, representing the count of worthy segments in the sequence.\n\nTo bring clarity, the Council often recounts tales from past trials. For instance, when the city's sky spelled \"12936,\" there were fifteen segments in total, but only eleven earned the title of worthiness under the Tail-End Trial; segments like \"29,\" \"129,\" \"293,\" and \"2936\" fell short. Another time, with the sequence \"5701283,\" twelve longer segments passed the trial, and the six single-glyph segments ending in a non-void glyph passed naturally, summing to eighteen. In one memorable event, the sequence \"1010101010\" revealed that only the segments ending in the glyph one could succeed, resulting in twenty-five worthy segments.\n\nBy weaving these traditions and recounting the rules, the city ensures that every resident understands not only how to interpret the numbers in their skies, but also how to honor the logic and lore of Numeralis.",

A more efficient solution would be to use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem in O(n^2) time.\n\nHere is a more efficient solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:\n        n = len(s)\n        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        count = 0\n        \n        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n            for j in range(i, n):\n                if s[i] == s[j] and (j-i <= 2 or dp[i+1][j-1]):\n                    dp[i][j] = True\n                    count += 1\n        \n        return count\n```\n\nIn this solution, `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome. The outer loop iterates over all possible ending indices `j` for substrings of increasing length, and the inner loop iterates over all possible starting indices `i`. If `s[i]` is equal to `s[j]` and the substring `s[i+1:j]` is a palindrome (or if the substring is of length 0 or 1), then `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), which is more efficient for large inputs.\n",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeria, a council of wise mathematicians is tasked with a unique challenge by the ruling monarch. Each year, they are given two scrolls: one lists the strengths of N guardians, each characterized by a positive integer reflecting their magical power, and the other contains the names of up to four legendary beasts, each with a mystical number representing their weakness. The number of beasts never exceeds the number of guardians. The city\u2019s security depends on a crucial rule: for every beast, there must exist at least one guardian whose power is an exact multiple of that beast\u2019s weakness.\n\nHowever, increasing a guardian\u2019s power is a taxing ordeal, requiring rare potions and significant effort. Each time a guardian\u2019s power is enhanced by a single point, the council counts it as one operation, and their goal is always to expend the fewest possible operations to prepare for the beasts' arrival. If a guardian\u2019s strength already meets the requirement for a beast, no action is needed. Otherwise, careful planning must be taken to reach the desired outcome with utmost efficiency.\n\nThe monarch presents the council with the two scrolls each year. The first scroll lists N numbers (one for each guardian), and the second scroll lists as many as four numbers (one for each beast). The council\u2019s challenge is to determine the minimum number of magical enhancements\u2014totaling across all guardians\u2014necessary so that for every beast on the list, at least one guardian\u2019s power is a perfect multiple of the beast\u2019s weakness.\n\nTo clarify the process, the monarch dictates the council must use the following protocol:  \n- First, write the number N (the count of guardians) and K (the count of beasts) on a parchment, followed by the N strengths of the guardians in a line.  \n- On the next line, list the K weaknesses of the legendary beasts.  \n- After deep calculation, the council must return a single number: the fewest enhancements needed to ensure all beasts are properly matched to guardians according to the sacred rule.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some past years\u2019 challenges to illustrate.  \nOne year, there were three guardians with strengths 1, 2, and 3, and only one beast with a weakness of 4. The council realized that by boosting the third guardian\u2019s strength from 3 to 4 with just one enhancement, the beast would be satisfied, and no further effort was needed.  \nAnother year, two guardians stood at powers 8 and 4, facing two beasts with weaknesses 10 and 5. By incrementing the first guardian\u2019s strength twice, bringing it to 10, the council ensured 10 is a multiple of both 10 and 5, and thus both beasts were covered with only two enhancements.  \nOn a particularly easy year, three guardians with strengths 7, 9, and 10 faced a single beast with a weakness of 7. One guardian already matched the beast\u2019s requirement perfectly, so no enhancements were necessary.\n\nIn Numeria, this tradition repeats each year, and the council\u2019s cleverness in minimizing their magical efforts is a point of city pride. Thus, whenever a new challenge arrives, the council sifts through the scrolls, seeks the optimal solution, and records their answer as the number of enhancements needed to keep Numeria safe for another year.",

It then iterates over both lists from the end to the beginning, comparing the elements at the current positions in both lists. If the elements are equal, it moves to the next pair. If the element in `nums` is greater than the element in `target`, it increments the count of operations by the difference and moves to the next pair in `nums`.

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Lexiconia, there was a curious tradition among its inhabitants: every festival season, townsfolk would decorate their windows with paper banners called captions, each inscribed with a string of letters. These captions were not just for show; they had to follow the old Festival Code. According to ancient decree, a caption was only considered worthy\u2014deemed a \u201cgood caption\u201d\u2014if every distinct letter upon it gathered in unwavering bands: that is, whenever a certain letter appeared, it did so in a cluster, never alone or in a pair, but always in a sequence of at least three, one after another without interruption.\n\nNow, each season, the Guild of Scribes was tasked with inspecting and, if need be, transforming these captions to ensure no rule was broken. The Scribes, however, had strict limitations on their craft. When faced with a wayward letter, they could, with a flick of their quills, nudge it forward or backward by a single step in the alphabet\u2014never more, never less, and always mindful not to stray beyond the bounds of the alphabet itself. A letter at the very beginning ('a') could only move forward, and a letter at the end ('z') could only move backward. \n\nGiven a banner of length N (with N being at least 1 and never more than five times ten to the power of four), the Guild's mission was clear: transform the letters, using as few adjustments as possible, until the caption conformed to the Code. And should several possible banners emerge with the same minimal effort, the Guild would always favor the one that came earliest in the lexicon\u2014that is, the lexicographically smallest among them. If, after all their wisdom and toil, no valid arrangement could be achieved, the Guild would reluctantly return an empty roll, leaving no caption at all.\n\nWhenever a household summoned the Guild, they would present their current banner as a string of lowercase English letters, and the Guild would reply with a single string\u2014the transformed, Code-abiding caption, or else the mark of impossibility: an empty string, should the task prove unattainable. Each request arrived in the form:\n- **Input:** caption (the current arrangement of the banner\u2019s letters)\n- **Output:** the transformed, good caption (or an empty string if the task was impossible).\n\nFor example, consider the home of the Cartwrights, whose window bore the banner \u201ccdcd.\u201d The Guild, after their deliberations, found two ways to restore harmony: by shifting selected letters forward, they could make \u201cdddd,\u201d or by nudging others backward, achieve \u201ccccc.\u201d Both methods required two careful adjustments, but as \u201ccccc\u201d was lexicographically first, it was chosen as the rightful caption.\n\nIn another case, the Alcott family presented the troublesome \u201caca.\u201d Two interventions were necessary: first, the central letter was nudged forward to \u201cb,\u201d making \u201caba,\u201d and then forward again to \u201ca,\u201d yielding three steadfast \u2018a\u2019s in a row\u2014\u201caaa\u201d\u2014a perfect banner by the Festival Code. Here, \u201caaa\u201d was the only possible good caption, so it adorned their window.\n\nYet not all banners could be saved. The Briar residence showed \u201cbc\u201d\u2014too short and too stubborn to be molded, no matter how many times the Scribes tried to nudge the letters. Here, the Guild returned an empty roll, and the window remained undecorated, a reminder that not every caption could be made good, even in the magical city of Lexiconia.",

It iterates over the string caption and checks for three consecutive letters. If they are all the same, it moves the third letter forward. If the second and third letters are the same, it moves the second letter forward. If the first and second letters are the same, it moves the first letter backward. The function `ord` is used to convert a character to its ASCII value and `chr` is used to convert an ASCII value back to a character. The modulo operation is used to ensure that the letter wraps around to 'a' if it goes past 'z'.\n",

If the minimum cost is more than half the length of the caption, we return an empty string because it's impossible to transform the caption into a good caption.\n\nFinally, if the minimum cost is less than or equal to half the length of the caption, we return the caption if the minimum cost is even, or the caption without the last character if the minimum cost is odd.\n",

        "question_content": "In the kingdom of Numaria, there exists a sacred tradition known as the Rite of Division. Each year, the High Mathemagician gathers a row of enchanted stones\u2014each glowing with a power that reflects a number inscribed upon it. The number of stones in the ritual, always falling between two and a hundred, is determined well in advance by ancient decree (let us call this number N). Each stone is imbued with a strength\u2014a positive value not less than one and not more than one hundred, drawn from the magical wellspring of the realm.\n\nAs the ceremony unfolds, the Mathemagician must choose points along the line of stones to place a silken partition. Each partition splits the stones into two distinct and non-empty covens: the Left Coven, comprising the first group of stones up to a chosen point, and the Right Coven, holding the stones that follow. The practitioners of Numaria believe that the harmony of the ritual is determined by the balance of energies: the difference between the total power of the Left Coven and that of the Right Coven. If this difference is an even number, the partition is said to be auspicious and worthy of note.\n\nThe challenge facing the Mathemagician is to survey every possible site for such a partition\u2014never at the final stone, for both covens must contain at least one stone apiece. For each possible division, the Mathemagician calculates the sum of the strengths in the Left and Right Covens, observes their difference, and judges whether the result is even. The ultimate goal is to count, with utmost efficiency, the total number of auspicious partitions possible for the given lineup of stones.\n\nWhen the rite is performed, the procession of stones is announced as a sequence of N numbers, each separated by a space. The crowd awaits a single number in response: the tally of auspicious partitions. For example, if the sequence spoken by the crier is \u201c10 10 3 7 6,\u201d the Mathemagician may conjure the following partitions: after the first stone (with differences of -16), after the second (difference of 4), after the third (difference of 10), and after the fourth (difference of 24). Each of these differences is even, yielding an answer of four. If the sequence is \u201c1 2 2,\u201d the Mathemagician finds no partition where the difference is even, so the tally is zero. For \u201c2 4 6 8,\u201d each possible split produces an even difference, hence the response is three.\n\nIn every ceremony, the Mathemagician listens to the sequence of stones (the input), then solemnly declares the number of auspicious partitions (the output) as an answer for all to hear. The rules are strict\u2014no partition can leave a coven empty, the strength of each stone obeys ancient bounds, and only the even differences matter in the count. Thus, the Rite of Division continues, honoring both tradition and the mysterious balance of numbers in Numaria.",

The base case is when the sum of strengths of the left group is 0 and the sum of strengths of the right group is 0. The number of ways to divide the stones into two groups such that the sum of strengths of the left group is 0 and the sum of strengths of the right group is 0 is 1.

It first calculates the total sum of the numbers. Then it creates a list `dp` of size `total_sum // 2 + 1`, where each element `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to partition the numbers into two groups such that the sum of the numbers in the first group is `i`.\n\nFor each number `num` in the input list, it updates the `dp` list in reverse order to avoid duplicate counting. If `num` is chosen, the sum of the numbers in the first group increases by `num`, so the new sum `i - num` needs to be reached. The number of ways to reach this sum is `dp[i - num]`, and it is added to the number of ways to reach the current sum `i`.\n\nFinally, it returns the sum of all elements in the `dp` list minus 1, because the empty set is not a valid partition.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n * sum), where n is the number of numbers and sum is the total sum of the numbers.

The idea is to divide the stones into two groups such that the sum of the strengths in the left group is equal to the sum in the right group. The sum of the strengths in the left group is always less than or equal to half of the total sum of the strengths.

Then it initializes a 1D array dp with size equal to half of the total sum plus one. The dp[i] represents the number of ways to divide the stones into two groups such that the sum of the strengths in the left group is i. The dp[0] is initialized to 1 because there is one way to divide the stones into two groups where the sum of the strengths in the left group is 0. Then it iterates over each stone in the nums array. For each stone, it iterates over the dp array in reverse order starting from the total sum of the strengths divided by 2 to the strength of the current stone. For each i, it adds the number of ways to divide the stones into two groups such that the sum of the strengths in the left group is i - the strength of the current stone to the number of ways to divide the stones into two groups such that the sum of the strengths in the left group is i. Finally, it returns the sum of the dp array minus 1 because the empty group is not counted.\n",

The idea is to count the number of ways to partition the numbers into two groups such that the sum of the numbers in each group is equal. The total sum of the numbers is divided by 2 because we are looking for the difference between the sum of the numbers in the two groups to be even. The dp array keeps track of the number of ways to get to each sum. For each number in the input list, we update the dp array by adding the number of ways to get to the current sum without the current number and the number of ways to get to the current sum minus the current number. The final result is the sum of the dp array minus 1 because we subtract the case where all numbers are in one group.\n"

The number of stones in the line\u2014call it N\u2014can range from a lone pebble to fifty shimmering gems. Each stone\u2019s number is chosen between zero and fifty, inclusive. The villagers, ever fond of puzzles, gather to gaze at these sequences and ponder their deepest secrets.\n\nDuring the festival, the Council proposes a peculiar challenge. From the line of stones, the villagers must form magical clusters, each made up of exactly K consecutive stones. The value of K, always at least one and never more than the total number of stones, is chosen by the Council's roll of the dice before the festival begins. Each possible cluster, sliding from the start to the end of the line, is inspected closely\u2014each stone within a cluster is said to participate in that unique grouping.\n\nBut the true heart of the challenge lies in the legend of the \"Almost Vanished Stone.\" A number is considered almost vanished if it is found in exactly one single cluster of the given size, and in no other. If more than one number shares this fate, the villagers are to seek the largest such number among them. Should the villagers discover that no such number exists\u2014if every number is either missing from the clusters altogether or appears in multiple clusters\u2014they are to declare the search a failure, marking it with a solemn -1.\n\nThe Council announces the challenge thus: \u201cGiven a line of stones, with their numbers recited in sequence, and a chosen cluster size, identify the greatest number that features in only a single magical cluster. If there is none, let your answer be -1.\u201d The villagers whisper these rules into the winds of Numeria, always remembering: the sequence of numbers and the cluster size are both shared at the start, and their answer must be spoken as a single number.\n\nFor example, in one festival, the stones had numbers [3, 9, 2, 1, 7] and the cluster size chosen was 3. The villagers found that only the stones marked 3 and 7 appeared in exactly one cluster each\u2014and since 7 is the larger, 7 was proclaimed the Almost Vanished Stone. In another festival, with stones showing [3, 9, 7, 2, 1, 7] and a cluster size of 4, only the stone with 3 was almost vanished, so the answer was 3. Yet, in a rare festival with only two stones, both showing the number zero and with clusters of size 1, no number was almost vanished, and the villagers rightly answered with -1.\n\nThus, the lore of Numeria preserves the puzzle: **Given a sequence of N numbered stones and a cluster size K, the villagers must return the largest number that appears in exactly one single cluster of size K\u2014or -1 if there is none.** As the Festival of Contiguous Chains continues each year, the villagers treasure the cleverness and clarity of this rule, always eager for the next enchanting sequence to test their wit.",

It then sorts this list. The Counter object is used to count the frequency of each digit in the list. The solution iterates over the Counter object, and for each digit that appears only once, it assigns the corresponding number from the sorted list to the leftmost available position in the answer list. For each digit that appears more than once, it assigns the corresponding numbers from the sorted list to the rightmost available positions in the answer list. Finally, it returns the maximum number from the answer list.\n",

        "question_content": "In the bustling realm of Numeria, famed for its mazes of enchanted tiles, the annual Zigzag Pilgrimage was the talk of the land. The wise elders had long carved a tradition: upon the grand floor of the Numbers Hall, whose size was determined by two ancient runes\u2014one denoting the number of rows (let us call it N, always at least two but never more than fifty), the other the number of columns (M, sharing the same limits)\u2014a pilgrim would journey in a most peculiar way. Each tile shimmered with a unique magic, a positive power no less than one and never greater than two thousand five hundred.\n\nBut the sacred path was not straightforward. Tradition dictated the following: The pilgrim would begin on the very first tile at the northwestern edge. Along the first row, they would stride eastward, stepping from tile to tile, until reaching the edge. At the end, they would descend directly one row below and, reversing course, walk westward, back toward the western wall. This dance\u2014right, down, left, down\u2014continued, snaking through every row, until the southernmost edge was reached, marking the journey\u2019s end.\n\nYet, the pilgrimage\u2019s true challenge lay in restraint. Not every shimmering tile could be honored. The pilgrim was to step on a tile, then, in courageous discipline, skip the very next, touching only every alternate tile in this zigzag path. The aim was to gather the magical energies, recording each honored tile\u2019s value in the sequence they were visited. Only these chosen energies, aligned in the order of visitation, would grant the pilgrim acclaim.\n\nThe scribes of Numeria required that each journey be described thus: First, they must receive the twin runes\u2014N (the number of rows) and M (the number of columns). Next, the magic of each tile must be listed, row by row, each row comprising M numbers. After the journey, the pilgrim would present, in order, the list of magic energies gathered from the visited tiles.\n\nTo illuminate the tradition, the elders offered chronicles of past journeys. In one, a hall with two rows and two columns, the tiles bore the energies [[1,2],[3,4]]. The pilgrim, starting at the northwest, strode upon the 1, skipped the 2, then, after descending and heading west, skipped the 3 and finished upon the 4. Thus, the energies gathered were [1,4].\n\nIn another, a hall of three rows and two columns, the grid read [[2,1],[2,1],[2,1]]. The zigzag path honored the 2 in the northwest, skipped the 1, moved down and west, honored the next 1 (as it was the alternate on that path), skipped the 2, then descended again, honored the final 2, and so on, finally collecting [2,1,2].\n\nIn the grandest hall chronicled, with three rows and three columns, the tiles shone [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]. The path honored the 1, skipped the 2, took the 3 at the row\u2019s end, dropped down, honored the 5 in the center (as the alternate due to the zigzag), then descended, honored the 7, skipped the 8, and finished with the 9. The energies gathered: [1,3,5,7,9].\n\nThus, the legend of Numeria\u2019s zigzag pilgrimage endures\u2014a tale of order, restraint, and efficiency\u2014where mastering the path is not just about completion, but honoring the tradition\u2019s every nuance, step by alternate step.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Lexiconia, the ancient Guild of Scribes upholds a peculiar tradition. The Scribes often receive scrolls bearing strings of mystical runes, each rune a lowercase letter from the common alphabet. The Guild is sometimes asked to investigate these scrolls to find a \u201cPerfect Chant\u201d\u2014a sequence of exactly K consecutive runes, all identical, and forming a chant that stands apart from its neighbors. The Scribes, ever methodical, use the sacred integer K (which must always be at least one and never greater than the total number of runes in the scroll) to determine the length of their search.\n\nTo be considered a Perfect Chant, a candidate stretch of runes must satisfy three ancient edicts. First, the chant must be a series of exactly K runes, each identical to the others. Second, should there be a rune immediately before the start of the chant on the scroll, it must differ from the chant\u2019s rune; the same holds for the rune immediately following the chant. If the chant is at the very beginning or end of the scroll, the absence of a neighboring rune on that side is considered acceptable. These rules are never broken, for the Guild\u2019s reputation depends on their strict adherence.\n\nThe task set before the Scribes is clear: for each scroll and each value of K handed to them, they must determine whether at least one Perfect Chant exists somewhere within the runes. If such a chant is found, they must proudly declare \u201ctrue\u201d; otherwise, they must return \u201cfalse.\u201d Their answer must be as definitive as possible, based on the scroll and the value K. With scrolls never longer than one hundred runes and the sacred K never stretching beyond the scroll\u2019s length, the task, while exacting, is always within the Guild\u2019s grasp.\n\nWhen the Guild receives a request, the head Scribe reads the parchment, where the input is always provided precisely: first, the string of runes (the scroll), and second, the sacred integer K (the chant length). After pondering the scroll and consulting the edicts, the Scribe writes a single word in response\u2014either \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d\u2014to record the result of their search for a Perfect Chant.\n\nLet us consider two examples from the Scribes\u2019 archives. On one occasion, a scroll arrived inscribed with \u201caaabaaa,\u201d and the Scribe was asked to seek a chant of length three. Scanning the runes, the Scribe discovered that the final three runes, \u201caaa,\u201d formed a Perfect Chant: all identical, preceded by a \u201cb,\u201d and with no rune following. Thus, the Scribe confidently wrote \u201ctrue.\u201d On another day, a scroll bearing \u201cabc\u201d arrived, with a search for a chant of length two. No pair of identical, properly isolated runes could be found, so on that day, the Scribe penned \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nThrough these rituals, the Guild of Scribes ensures that all requests, whether for scrolls of few or many runes, are treated with precision and care. Their answers echo with the certainty of tradition and the clarity of logic, as is the way of Lexiconia.",

For each substring, it checks if all characters are the same (which is the condition for a \"Perfect Chant\"), and if the first and last characters of the substring are different from the characters immediately before and after the substring (as per the rules of the problem). If both conditions are met, it returns `True`. If no such substring is found after checking all possible substrings, it returns `False`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n*k), where n is the length of the string and k is the length of the substring. This is because in the worst case scenario, we need to check all possible substrings of length k in the string. The space complexity is O(k), as we need to store a substring of length k at any given time.\n",

The order\u2019s sacred stones\u2014each inscribed with a unique value\u2014were arranged in a line, and every year, the council would gather to perform the Ritual of Extremes, a tradition that tested both the wisdom and cunning of its members. The ritual\u2019s purpose was to unearth the combined essence of each possible collection of stones, but with a twist: only collections of a certain modest size were honored by the council\u2019s rules.\n\nThe council decreed that the number of stones presented for the ritual was always a known quantity\u2014let\u2019s call it N, sometimes as many as one hundred thousand, but never fewer than one. Each stone\u2019s power (its inscribed number) rested within the bounds of zero to one billion. Of utmost importance, however, was the constraint on collections: no group assembled for the ritual could possess more than K stones, with K never exceeding seventy or the total number of stones, whichever was smaller. Thus, the council\u2019s traditions ensured the ritual remained both challenging and fair.\n\nAccording to the sacred tradition, every possible gathering of stones\u2014so long as it included at least one stone, and no more than K\u2014was considered a \"collection.\" For each collection, the council would consult the wisest and the strongest stone (that is, the stone with the smallest power and the one with the largest). The sum of these two values was called the collection\u2019s \"essence.\" The order\u2019s true test was to combine the essences of all qualifying collections and declare the grand total, but with a critical caveat: Numeria\u2019s treasury could only record the answer in its own special ledger, which wrapped around after reaching one billion and seven. Thus, the final tally had to be presented as the remainder after dividing by ten to the ninth plus seven.\n\nThe council always received the details of the ritual in a prescribed format. First, the scribes would inscribe two numbers: N (the count of stones) and K (the maximum size of assemblies). On the next line, the power of each stone was listed in sequence. The answer\u2014the combined essence of every allowed collection\u2014was what the archmage sought.\n\nFor example, when the stones bore the powers [1, 2, 3] and the council permitted collections of up to two stones, the ritual yielded a total essence of 24. Each collection ([1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3]) contributed the sum of its weakest and strongest member, for a final tally of 24. In another season, with powers [5, 0, 6] and only single-stone ceremonies allowed, the total was 22, since each stone alone contributed twice (once as both weakest and strongest). In a rare case where every stone was identical\u2014[1, 1, 1]\u2014and up to two stones could assemble at a time, the essence for each gathering was just twice the stone\u2019s power, repeated for every possible collection, resulting in a total of 12.\n\nThus, the Ritual of Extremes balanced tradition and logic, rewarding those who could swiftly and accurately sum the powers of all possible qualifying gatherings, forever mindful of Numeria\u2019s wrapping treasury.",

The dp array is used to store the maximum sum of the first i numbers, using at most j of them. The base case is dp[i][0] = nums[i-1] for all i, because using 0 numbers gives a sum of 0. For each i and j, we either choose the i-th number (in which case we add it to the sum of the first i-1 numbers using j-1 of them), or we don't choose the i-th number (in which case we take the sum of the first i-1 numbers using j of them).

        "question_content": "In the bustling kingdom of Numeria, the Grand Council governed a land composed of winding roads, each paved with magical cobblestones. Each stone along a road had its own magical value\u2014some shining brightly with energy, others dimmed by age or neglect. The Council cherished harmony, and it was a well-known law that stretches of road where all stones glowed with the same intensity had special significance. Such stretches, if precisely the right length and undisturbed by overlaps with one another, were called the \"Perfect Ways\" of Numeria.\n\nThe Council's scholars had decreed strict rules for the creation of these Perfect Ways. Each one must consist of exactly **x** consecutive stones, all emitting the same magical value, and no two Perfect Ways could share even a single stone. Out of all the roads in the kingdom, the Council sought to create at least **k** Perfect Ways on a chosen road so that the kingdom\u2019s harmony could be celebrated in ceremonies. However, altering a stone\u2019s magical value was taxing; each time a stone's value was increased or decreased by one, it cost an operation, requiring the magic-wielders\u2019 effort and time.\n\nTo ensure clarity among the apprentices and future magicians, the Council described the laws of the task using both measurement and tradition. The road to be improved would be represented by a sequence of magical stones, known as the \"magic-list.\" For each test, the Council would declare the length of the desired Perfect Way (**x**), and the minimum number of such Ways (**k**) to be created. The challenge was to determine the lowest possible total number of magical adjustment operations needed to forge at least **k** non-overlapping Perfect Ways along the road.\n\nThe Council required the following input format whenever a new road was presented for improvement: First, a single line declaring the sequence of magical values (the magic-list), followed by two numbers\u2014one indicating the required length of each Perfect Way (**x**), and one for the minimum number of Ways (**k**) to be formed. The solution must be presented as a single line: the minimum number of magical adjustments needed to fulfill the task.\n\nHere are tales of two such ceremonies, to guide future magicians:\n\n1. On a road with stones glowing [5, -2, 1, 3, 7, 3, 6, 4, -1], the Council desired Perfect Ways of length 3, and at least 2 such Ways. Magicians cleverly pooled their efforts: by using 3 operations to brighten the second stone and 2 to dim the fourth, the segment [1, 1, 1] was formed. Then, 1 operation brightened the sixth stone, and 2 more dimmed the seventh, creating [4, 4, 4]. Thus, with 8 total adjustments, the Council\u2019s requirement was satisfied.\n\n2. Another tale tells of a road paved [9, -2, -2, -2, 1, 5], where the desired Way was of length 2, and the Council required at least 2. The solution was simple: 3 operations dimmed the fifth stone, making two non-overlapping [\u20132, \u20132] segments, with just 3 magical efforts needed in total.\n\nThrough these stories, all magicians of Numeria learned to use their powers wisely, always seeking the most efficient path to harmony. By studying the examples and the rules above, apprentices could divine the minimal exertion needed to satisfy the Grand Council\u2019s lofty demands.",

A new law\u2014dubbed the Threshold Decree\u2014mandated that no tower could stretch more than a certain number of skybridges outward, a limit determined by the city\u2019s appointed threshold. Worse, the Grand Luminary of Numeris feared that the city might suffer under the strain of heavy bridges. The council\u2019s new goal became clear: prune the skybridges so that travel from every tower to the heart, Tower Zero, remained possible, while ensuring no tower exceeded its allotted threshold of outgoing bridges\u2014and above all, the heaviest remaining bridge in the city would be as light as possible.\n\nThe city\u2019s architects were summoned. Their task: to study the ledger, remove as many bridges as needed (or none at all), and craft the lightest, most efficient network. The bridges that remained must allow every citizen, starting from any tower, a route to the heart\u2014never leaving anyone stranded. Furthermore, no tower was allowed to have more than the sacred threshold of pathways leading outward from it. If the city could be thusly connected, the architects must report back the weight of the heaviest remaining bridge in their new design; if it was impossible, they were to return word of failure\u2014a single, sorrowful number: minus one.\n\nTo receive a challenge from the council, the architects would be given the following in their scrolls: the total number of towers (N), a complete list of all bridges as trios of origin, destination, and weight, and the current threshold limit. Upon completing their work, they\u2019d return a single number\u2014the minimal possible weight of the heaviest bridge allowed under the new rules, or minus one if the task proved impossible.\n\nSo it was that, on one day, the council presented a challenge:  \n**The city had five towers. The ledger listed the following bridges:**  \n- From Tower One to Tower Zero, weight 1  \n- From Tower Two to Tower Zero, weight 2  \n- From Tower Three to Tower Zero, weight 1  \n- From Tower Four to Tower Three, weight 1  \n- From Tower Two to Tower One, weight 1  \n**The threshold was set at two.**  \nThe architects, after careful deliberation, removed the heavier bridge from Tower Two to Tower Zero. With all conditions met, the city\u2019s network was restored so that no bridge\u2019s weight exceeded one.\n\nIn another test, the council described five towers with a different ledger of bridges and a threshold set to one. The architects found themselves stymied\u2014no matter how they tried, there remained a tower from which the heart could never be reached. With heavy hearts, they reported back minus one.\n\nOver time, tales spread of similar challenges\u2014some solvable, some not. The city\u2019s history books now record these trials, written not in numbers and symbols, but in the living story of Numeris and its ever-shifting web of skybridges.",

Otherwise, it adds the weight of the bridge to the list of weights, and recursively calls DFS for its children. The function `dfs` returns the maximum weight of the bridges that can be crossed from the current node to the heart. If no bridges can be crossed, it returns 0.

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeria, there exists a grand Hall of Voices, governed by N Citizens, each with a unique badge number ranging from zero to one less than the total count. The Hall is abuzz with constant chatter and official notices. Each day, events are meticulously recorded by Scribes, who never miss a detail. The Scribes\u2019 scrolls are organized as a sequence of happenings, each inscribed with three pieces of information: the nature of the event, the precise time it occurred, and, if relevant, the Citizens involved. The sequence may contain up to a hundred such records, but never fewer than one.\n\nEvery event falls into one of two rituals. The first is the Proclamation, in which messages are issued\u2014sometimes directed to specific Citizens by badge number, sometimes to all present in the Hall (\"ALL\"), and sometimes only to those currently present and attentive (\"HERE\"). The second is the Withdrawal: a Citizen may formally excuse themselves at a set moment, becoming unreachable for exactly sixty ticks of Numeria\u2019s great clock, after which they will automatically return, rejoining their peers in the Hall.\n\nThe society\u2019s laws dictate the following customs:  \n\u2014 All Citizens begin each day present in the Hall.  \n\u2014 When a Withdrawal is scheduled at a given moment, it is always processed before any Proclamation or message at that same instant.  \n\u2014 The Proclamation can mention Citizens directly by badge number, by summoning \u201cALL,\u201d or by calling out \u201cHERE.\u201d If \u201cALL\u201d is called, every Citizen will be considered mentioned, regardless of where they are. If \u201cHERE\u201d is invoked, only those physically present\u2014those not having recently Withdrawn\u2014are summoned.  \n\u2014 A single Proclamation may mention the same Citizen multiple times, and every such instance must be recognized and tallied.  \n\u2014 When a Citizen Withdraws, it is always from a state of presence, never from absence.\n\nYour challenge, as the chief Scribe, is to keep a precise count for each badge-wearing Citizen: **how many times has each one been named in all the Proclamations, counting every mention, even duplicates?** You must provide this number for every Citizen, striving for utmost accuracy and completeness, following these customs to the letter.\n\nWhenever a new day is recorded, the Scribes will present you with two things:  \n\u2014 First, the count of Citizens, as a single integer.  \n\u2014 Second, the full log of events, structured as a sequence, each inscribed as follows: the event type (\u201cMESSAGE\u201d or \u201cOFFLINE\u201d), the moment the event occurred, and, if a Proclamation, the list of Citizens or tokens (\u201cidX\u201d, \u201cALL\u201d, or \u201cHERE\u201d); if a Withdrawal, the badge number of the Citizen departing. Your reply is to be a single sequence of integers, one for each Citizen in badge order, reporting the number of times each was named in Proclamations.\n\nLet us illustrate with examples from the annals of Numeria:\n\n**Example Day 1:**  \nCitizens: 2  \nEvents:  \n1. At tick 10, a Proclamation names badge one and badge zero.  \n2. At tick 11, badge zero Withdraws for sixty ticks.  \n3. At tick 71, a Proclamation calls \u201cHERE,\u201d summoning all present.  \nResults: Both badge zero and badge one are named twice.\n\n**Example Day 2:**  \nCitizens: 2  \nEvents:  \n1. At tick 10, a Proclamation names badge one and badge zero.  \n2. At tick 11, badge zero Withdraws.  \n3. At tick 12, a Proclamation calls \u201cALL,\u201d summoning all regardless of presence.  \nResults: Both badge zero and badge one are named twice.\n\n**Example Day 3:**  \nCitizens: 2  \nEvents:  \n1. At tick 10, badge zero Withdraws.  \n2. At tick 12, a Proclamation calls \u201cHERE.\u201d  \nResults: Only badge one, still present, is mentioned, while the absent badge zero receives no mention.\n\nThus, in Numeria\u2019s Hall of Voices, your task is to carefully process the day\u2019s events\u2014mindful of absences, presences, and the precise moments each Proclamation is made\u2014to report the tally of names each Citizen has heard ringing through the Hall.",

        "question_content": "In the distant land of Numeria, fortunes were determined not by luck, but by the ancient art of Subarrhythmia\u2014a contest in which participants sought treasures hidden in a long, winding corridor of vaults. Each vault held a mystery: sometimes dazzling gold, sometimes a curse that sapped one's wealth. This corridor was of length N, and each vault was marked with a secret number, some positive and some negative, reflecting its blessing or curse. The seekers were given two sacred tokens: one inscribed with the glyph K, denoting how many vault clusters they could unlock, and the other with M, setting the minimum length of each cluster they dared to claim.\n\nBut the Elder Council, who governed this game, set strict rules. No two clusters could overlap\u2014a seeker could not let one claimed chain of vaults touch or intermingle with another. And no cluster could be smaller than the length dictated by the token marked M; the council believed that smaller claims brought bad luck and disorder. Only those who mastered the art of selecting the most profitable, non-overlapping vault chains\u2014each cluster containing at least M vaults\u2014could hope to win the grand prize.\n\nYour challenge, then, is to help a Numerian seeker: Determine the greatest sum of blessings they can claim by choosing up to K distinct, non-overlapping clusters of consecutive vaults, each cluster spanning at least M vaults. The sum of vault treasures in each chosen cluster is added to the seeker\u2019s fortune. The seeker strives not just to satisfy the council\u2019s rules, but to maximize their wealth, choosing clusters as skillfully as possible.\n\nTo join the contest, a Numerian must present their scroll of vaults\u2014a list of N numbers, one for each vault, followed by the glyphs K and M, each on its own line. In council terms, the input is given as:\n- A single line containing N numbers (the vault's blessings or curses, separated by spaces)\n- A line with the number K (the number of clusters the seeker may unlock)\n- A line with the number M (the minimum length for each cluster)\n\nThe council\u2019s seers will then inscribe the answer\u2014the maximum fortune the seeker can gather under these rules\u2014on a single line.\n\nFor example, when one seeker brought the scroll `[1 2 -1 3 3 4]`, with glyphs `2` and `2`, the council decreed: Choose the chain of vaults from position 4 to 6 (worth 10) and the chain from position 1 to 2 (worth 3); together, their fortune would be 13. In another, sterner trial, the scroll read `[-10 3 -1 -2]` with glyphs `4` and `1`; though every vault must be opened alone, the total fortune was simply the sum of all vaults: -10. Thus, the council\u2019s inscription matched each seeker's journey: the input scroll, the tokens of K and M, and, at the end, the greatest total fortune possible under Numerian law.",

The dp array is used to store the maximum sum of blessings that can be obtained by choosing up to j clusters of consecutive vaults, where the last cluster has at least m vaults. The dp array is initialized with -inf, except for dp[0][0] which is initialized with 0.\n\nFor each vault, the solution iterates over all possible numbers of clusters (from 1 to the minimum of the number of vaults and k), and for each number of clusters, it iterates over all possible starting points of the last cluster (from m to the number of vaults). For each starting point, it updates the maximum sum of blessings that can be obtained by choosing up to j clusters of consecutive vaults.\n\nFinally, the solution returns the maximum sum of blessings that can be obtained by choosing up to k clusters of consecutive vaults.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 * k), where n is the number of vaults.

Along a winding avenue, N proud banners\u2014each emblazoned with a distinct number\u2014stood in a straight line, festooned in vibrant colors. The townsfolk eagerly awaited to see which banners would shine as \u201cillustrious,\u201d for only a select few could claim this coveted status during the festival.\n\nIn Numeria, the rules for becoming illustrious were strict and honored tradition. For a banner to be esteemed, it had to stand taller and prouder than both the banner that stood K places before it and the one K places after it, should those neighbors exist. If a banner was at the edge of the avenue\u2014such that one or both of these distant neighbors simply didn\u2019t exist\u2014it was said that the banner\u2019s solitary presence was enough to grant it the chance to prove itself illustrious, provided no neighbor challenged its height at the critical distance.\n\nThe Parade Master\u2019s annual challenge was well known: to survey the entire avenue and identify all the illustrious banners, summing their heights to determine the festival\u2019s grand total of pride. The aim was not to miss a single eligible banner, nor to count any that failed Numeria\u2019s strict standards. The task, thus, was to calculate this maximum possible sum of illustrious banners, in full accordance with the ancient laws.\n\nWhen visiting Numeria, festival scribes would receive a scroll with the following instructions:  \n**First, write the number of banners and the critical distance K on a single line.**  \n**Next, record the heights of each banner in order on the following line.**  \n**In return, the Parade Master would reveal a single number: the sum of all illustrious banner heights for that arrangement.**\n\nFor example, a scribe once penned an entry: there were six banners with heights 1, 3, 2, 1, 5, and 4, and the critical distance was 2. Upon inspection, the Master declared the illustrious banners were the second, fifth, and sixth, with heights 3, 5, and 4\u2014yielding a grand total of 12. In another instance, with two banners of heights 2 and 1 and a critical distance of 1, only the first banner was counted as illustrious, and the sum was simply 2.\n\nThus, each year, the Parade of Numbers called upon sharp minds and eager spirits to honor Numeria\u2019s banners\u2014ensuring the festival\u2019s glory shone as brightly as the sum of its illustrious heights.",

The idea is to keep track of the maximum sum of good numbers that we can get with at most `j` numbers from the first `i` numbers. If `j` is 0, then we can't get any good numbers, so we just take the `i`th number. If `j` is greater than 0, then we can either get the `i`th number or not get it. If we get the `i`th number, then the maximum sum is the maximum of the sum without the `i`th number and the sum with the `i-2`th number plus the `i`th number. If we don't get the `i`th number, then the maximum sum is the sum without the `i`th number.\n",

The wise Sage of Numeria, known for her fascination with patterns, has devised a new challenge for the youth of the realm. She lines up **N** of these stones in a row (where the number of stones is at least 1 and can reach as high as the stars\u2014up to eighty thousand). Each stone\u2019s power can range from the depths below the frozen sea to the peaks above the clouds, potentially as low as negative one million or as high as positive one million.\n\nTo bring order to the evaluation, the Sage has introduced the concept of the \u201cArcane Glance.\u201d This ritual allows the examiner to consider any group of consecutive stones, but only those whose number does not exceed a mystical threshold **K** (with **K** being at least one, but never more than the total number of stones). The youth must study all such groups\u2014whether a single stone, a pair, a triplet, or any formation up to **K** stones in length. For each group, they must observe the least and greatest power among the stones and whisper to the winds the sum of these two numbers.\n\nThe true crux of the Sage\u2019s challenge, and the task the youth must complete, is to **sum all these whispered numbers across every possible group of consecutive stones that contains no more than the allowed count**. The Sage demands not just a few observations, but **every qualifying group must be examined, and the sum of their minimum and maximum powers must be gathered**. The magic of Numeria requires this sum to be computed as efficiently as possible, for the number of stones could be vast, and the Sage is not known for her patience.\n\nTo participate, a youth must bring forth a scroll inscribed as follows: the first line provides the number of stones (N) and the mystical threshold (K); the second line lists the power values of each stone, from left to right. Once the ritual is performed, the Sage expects a single number\u2014the grand total sum\u2014as the answer, written on the final line of the scroll.\n\nFor example, consider a trial where three stones sit in a row, bearing the powers [1, 2, 3], and the youth is permitted to look at groups of up to two stones. The groups that qualify are: [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], and [2, 3]. For each, the least and greatest powers are combined (so for [1,2], the total is 1+2=3), and all these are added together, resulting in a grand total of 20.\n\nIn another case, the Sage arranges stones with powers [1, -3, 1] and sets the threshold at two. The valid groups are: [1], [-3], [1], [1, -3], and [-3, 1]. Their minimum and maximum powers are combined for each group and summed, producing a total of -6.\n\nThrough this tale, the Sage of Numeria has crafted both a trial of logic and a quest for efficiency, challenging all who seek her wisdom to master the art of the Arcane Glance.",

        "question_content": "In the fog-laden Kingdom of Numeria, there exists a legendary corridor built by the Mathemancers, a guild renowned for weaving numbers into the fabric of reality. This corridor is lined with shimmering stones, each inscribed with a single integer, and the length of the corridor is denoted by the symbol N. The corridor\u2019s magic dictates that N can range anywhere from the solitude of a solitary stone to the grandeur of a hundred stones in a row. Each stone\u2019s inscribed number, always between one and a thousand, determines the reach of its influence\u2014a concept revered by Numerians as a stone\u2019s \u201cecho.\u201d\n\nEvery day, the Academy of Calculation sends its apprentices to walk the corridor, each tasked with unraveling the sums of \u201cechoes.\u201d For each position along the corridor, an apprentice is instructed to gaze backward, counting as many stones as the number inscribed on the stone at their feet allows, but never stepping beyond the corridor\u2019s entrance. If their stone says \u201cfive,\u201d they count backwards five places\u2014including the current stone\u2014but if that would take them past the first stone, they simply start from the very beginning. This subtle rule holds for each position: the youngest apprentice begins at the very first stone, while the last counts backwards as far as their own echo allows but never past the entryway.\n\nThe grand challenge is pronounced thus: For each stone in the corridor, sum all the numbers inscribed on the stones within their echo (that is, from the earliest stone they may step back to, up to their current position). Then, gather all these sums, one for each position in the corridor, and add them together for the final total. The Academy prizes those who can complete this labor as efficiently as possible, honoring those who minimize hesitation, just as a master Numerian would.\n\nApprentices are given a scroll that details how to record their journey:  \n**Input:** The first line reveals a single symbol, N, denoting the number of stones. The second line contains N numbers, each separated by a space, representing the echoes on each stone in the order they appear in the corridor.  \n**Output:** The scroll expects a single number\u2014the grand total sum as dictated by Numeria\u2019s echo rules.\n\nLet us walk in the footsteps of famed apprentices. In one tale, the corridor bore three stones marked \u201c2 3 1.\u201d The first apprentice tallied only the first stone, the second combined the first and second, and the third summed the last two stones (since her echo only allowed a single step back). Their individual sums\u20142, 5, and 4\u2014added to form the grand total of 11.\n\nIn another tale, a longer corridor displayed \u201c3 1 1 2.\u201d Each apprentice gathered echoes from their allowed reach: only the first stone for the first, the first two for the second, the middle two for the third, and the last three for the fourth. Their echo sums\u20143, 4, 2, and 4\u2014culminated in a total of 13.\n\nThus, Numeria\u2019s apprentices continue their quest, ever seeking the swiftest way to tally the echoes of the Mathemancers\u2019 corridor, recording their input as N and a list of echoes, and outputting the final sum that honors the corridor\u2019s ancient magic.",

It first initializes a dictionary `prefix_sum` to store the prefix sums of the input list `nums`. The key is the prefix sum and the value is the number of times it appears in the list. The variable `total` is used to store the total sum, and `current_sum` is used to keep track of the current prefix sum.\n\nFor each number in the input list, the current prefix sum is updated by adding the number. Then, the number of subarrays that sum to `current_sum - echo` is added to the total sum. This is done by checking if `current_sum - echo` is in the dictionary `prefix_sum`. If it is, the corresponding value is added to the total sum. If it is not, 0 is added to the total sum.\n\nFinally, the current prefix sum is added to the dictionary `prefix_sum`. The total sum is returned as the result.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list `nums`, because it scans the list once and performs a constant time operation for each element. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, all elements in the list `nums` can be distinct, and the dictionary `prefix_sum` can store n entries.\n",

We initialize the prefix sum of the first element as 0. For each subsequent element, we add its value to the current sum and check if there is a prefix sum equal to the current sum minus the echo. If such a prefix sum exists, we add the count of such prefix sums to the total. We then update the count of the current prefix sum in the dictionary. Finally, we return the total.\n\nThis solution works because it calculates the sum of the numbers in the array from the beginning to the current position, and checks if there is a prefix sum that equals the current sum minus the echo. If such a prefix sum exists, it means that the sum of the numbers from the prefix sum to the current position equals the echo.

The dictionary is used to keep track of how many times a prefix sum has been seen before. This allows us to quickly count how many subarrays have a sum equal to the echo.\n\nThe solution iterates over the array, updating the current sum and the total count. If the current sum minus the echo is in the dictionary, it means we have found a subarray that sums to the echo, so we add the count of such subarrays to the total. After updating the dictionary, we increment the count of the current sum.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array.

The prefix sum is a list where each element is the sum of all elements up to that index. The hash map is used to store the frequency of each prefix sum.\n\nFor each number in the input list, we calculate the prefix sum modulo the echo. This ensures that the prefix sum never exceeds the echo. We then check if there is a prefix sum that equals the current prefix sum minus the echo.

The dictionary is initialized with a key-value pair `{0: 1}`, which means there is one prefix sum of 0 in the array. Then it iterates over the input array `nums`, updating the current sum of the array and the total count of prefix sums.

Finally, it returns the total count.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.

        "question_content": "In the highland realm of Deltoria, the land is woven with curious carpets\u2014each an intricate tapestry of tiles, arranged in long halls and vast chambers. Every carpet is rectangular, defined by its number of rows and columns, which the scholars of Deltoria denote by N and M, respectively. Each tile is painted with one of three colors: obsidian (marked by 0), ivory (marked by 1), or sapphire (marked by 2). These carpets are not just for show; hidden within their patterns are the legendary V-shaped paths, which the matron-keepers hope to discover.\n\nA V-shaped path, in the custom of ancient Deltoria, begins at a single tile of ivory. From there, the journey follows a pattern known by all children: after the ivory, the next step must land on a sapphire tile, then obsidian, alternating sapphire and obsidian into the distance (that is, after ivory, the colors go sapphire, obsidian, sapphire, obsidian, and so on). The path must always proceed along a diagonal of the carpet, be it from the top-left to the bottom-right, the bottom-right to the top-left, the top-right to the bottom-left, or the bottom-left to the top-right. At most once, and only once if at all, may a V-shaped path make a bold, clockwise turn\u2014switching from its original diagonal to the next in the circle of diagonals\u2014always keeping the color pattern unbroken.\n\nThe council of carpet-keepers seeks to know: for any given carpet, which is presented as a list of tile colors, what is the greatest number of tiles that may be gracefully trodden in a single V-shaped path? If no such sequence can be found, the answer must, alas, be nothing at all.\n\nTravelers wishing to report to the council must present the carpet\u2019s design as follows: first a pair of natural numbers, N and M, describing the size of the carpet; then N sequences, each with M numbers, representing the rows of tiles, with each number being 0, 1, or 2. The answer the council seeks is a single number\u2014the greatest length of any V-shaped journey to be found within the carpet.\n\nFor example, consider the following three tales from Deltoria\u2019s archives:\n\n1. One day, the carpet was described as:\n   ```\n   5 5\n   2 2 1 2 2\n   2 0 2 2 0\n   2 0 1 1 0\n   1 0 2 2 2\n   2 0 0 2 2\n   ```\n   The council discovered a splendid path of length 5, starting with the ivory tile at (1,3), weaving diagonally, and making a sharp clockwise turn before continuing its journey.\n\n2. Another time, with the carpet:\n   ```\n   5 5\n   2 2 2 2 2\n   2 0 2 2 0\n   2 0 1 1 0\n   1 0 2 2 2\n   2 0 0 2 2\n   ```\n   The longest V-shaped path counted was 4, as mapped out from the ivory at (3,4), turning at (4,3), and finishing with a flourish.\n\n3. In a particularly straightforward case, when the carpet was simply:\n   ```\n   1 1\n   1\n   ```\n   The only V-shaped path possible was the solitary ivory tile, yielding a length of 1.\n\nThrough these rules and the wisdom of their measurements, the people of Deltoria continue their quest, searching each new carpet for the longest possible V-shaped path, and recording its length\u2014or, should no such path exist, marking the record as zero.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling kingdom of Numeria, every citizen is born bearing a single-digit name, a numeral from the sacred lexicon\u2014always between the First and the Ninth Glyph. The Numerians are obsessed with order and precision: every gathering, every procession, every festival is governed by strict numerological customs. Among these, the Festival of Reflections is the most renowned, where townsfolk line up in sequence, each holding a placard bearing their digit-name, forming a grand banner known as the String of Identity.\n\nOn the eve of the festival, the High Numerist presented a unique challenge: to find, within the banner, a duo of neighbors who share a bond both unique and rare. According to ancient custom, such a pair must meet two conditions. First, the pair\u2019s digits must not be twins\u2014no repeated faces side by side. Second, and more mysteriously, each digit in the pair must only be seen in the entire banner as many times as its own value\u2014no more, no less. For instance, a citizen named Three must appear precisely thrice; a Five, precisely five times. Only then does the pair\u2019s relationship become officially recognized among the Numerians.\n\nThe High Numerist declared, \u201cYour task is to scan the banner from leftmost to rightmost, seeking the very first such eligible duo. Should you discover them, reveal their digits in the order they stand; if not, return nothing at all.\u201d On parchment, the Numerist explained the rules for all future generations:  \n- The String of Identity is always at least two digits long but never longer than a hundred, and each digit is chosen only from the First Glyph up to the Ninth\u2014no zeros or other numerals allowed.\n- The festival judges will announce the line of digits as the **Input**, and expect the first valid pair (as described) as the **Output**, or an empty proclamation if none exists.\n\nTo illustrate, the Numerist shared some festival tales:\n- When the banner was \u201c2523533,\u201d the citizens Five and Two stood together, but were soon followed by Two and Three. Here, Three appeared exactly three times, and Two exactly twice in the whole line; thus, \u201c23\u201d was the first celebrated pair.\n- On a quieter day, the banner read \u201c221\u201d\u2014the first friendly neighbors were Two and One. Two showed up twice, and One just once, so \u201c21\u201d was honored.\n- Sometimes, perfection eluded the Numerians. When the banner read \u201c22,\u201d no pair fit the requirements, and so silence was the only response.\n\nAnd so, the challenge of the Festival of Reflections endures: given any line of digit-named citizens, find the first pair of neighbors whose presence is as full and precise as their own value, but whose faces are not the same. If such a duo graces the banner, their names are announced; otherwise, the crowd awaits another year for perfection to be found.",

        "question_content": "In the tranquil kingdom of Lineara, a grand festival approaches, and with it comes an ancient tradition: the Parade of Painted Homes. Along the central avenue, there are **N** splendid houses, each perfectly aligned in a straight procession. The elders decree that, for the avenue to be truly resplendent, every house must be adorned in one of three vivid colors\u2014emerald, sapphire, or ruby. Yet, this is not a simple task, for the tradition holds strict rules about how these colors must grace the row.\n\nFirst, no two neighboring homes may bear the same hue, for such monotony is believed to bring misfortune. But the law of symmetry runs just as deep: for every house near the start of the avenue, there is one exactly the same distance from the end, and these paired homes\u2014like twin moons in the sky\u2014must never share a color. This means, for example, that if the first and last houses are painted, their colors must differ, as must the next pair inward, and so on. The cost for painting each house in each color is known in advance, recorded by the guild\u2019s meticulous scribes in a grand ledger\u2014each row of this ledger corresponds to a particular house, with each column detailing the cost for a specific color.\n\nThe festival committee\u2019s task is clear: they must assign colors to every house such that all the rules above are strictly obeyed, all while minimizing the total expense paid to the painter\u2019s guild. The prosperity of the kingdom depends on this efficiency; the lower the cost, the greater the festivities that can be funded. The input to this challenge arrives as follows: the elders will announce the number of houses, **N** (always an even number, and never fewer than two or greater than one hundred thousand), and the scribe will present the cost ledger as a list of **N** rows and three columns, each entry no larger than one hundred thousand.\n\nThe committee must devise a painting plan\u2014a list of color assignments, one for each house\u2014such that no two neighbors are the same, and every pair of houses mirrored about the center is also painted differently. Their goal is not merely to find any plan, but one that achieves the lowest possible sum of painting costs, as dictated by the ledger. When their solution is found, they must announce only this minimal total cost.\n\nFor instance, when four homes are to be adorned, with painting costs for each color as:  \n[[3,5,7],[6,2,9],[4,8,1],[7,3,5]],  \nthe committee, after much deliberation, may choose to paint the four houses emerald, sapphire, ruby, and sapphire, respectively. The costs\u20143, 2, 1, and 3\u2014sum to 9, and every condition is satisfied: no adjacent or symmetrically paired houses share a color. Thus, the kingdom\u2019s tally for this arrangement is 9.\n\nIn another year, when six houses must be painted, and the cost ledger reads:  \n[[2,4,6],[5,3,8],[7,1,9],[4,6,2],[3,5,7],[8,2,4]],  \nthe most frugal arrangement is to choose the sequence: emerald, ruby, sapphire, ruby, emerald, sapphire, yielding a total cost of 18. Once again, all rules of beauty and tradition are maintained.\n\nAnd so, as the sun sets on Lineara, the challenge stands: given any valid input, find the minimum sum of painting costs that ensures the avenue is as beautiful\u2014and as economically adorned\u2014as tradition demands. The input, given as the number of houses and the painting costs for each home, must be answered with the smallest possible total cost, and nothing more. The mathematicians among the committee are certain: with careful logic, even the grandest avenues can be adorned both beautifully and wisely.",

        "question_content": "In the kingdom of Rectanglia, the Grand Game of Distance was held once each century, attracting tacticians and mathematicians from across the land. At the heart of the game lay a mysterious board: an immense, perfectly rectangular mosaic whose dimensions\u2014length and width\u2014were each denoted by secret runes, known to the scholars as the letters M and N. On this board, a set of indistinguishable crystal tokens, exactly K in number, gleamed with magical potential. The rules of the Grand Game dictated that no two tokens could ever share the same mosaic tile, for such an act was said to bring chaos to the realm's delicate order.\n\nWithin the bounds of Rectanglia\u2019s tradition, participants were charged with a daunting challenge. Every legal configuration\u2014where all the tokens were placed on unique tiles\u2014was called a \u201cvalid arrangement.\u201d In each arrangement, the ancient scribes measured the \"bond of separation\" between every pair of tokens, always using the city\u2019s age-old counting method: the \u201cManhattan measure.\u201d This calculation spanned both the vertical and horizontal stretches between two tokens, tallying up their differences in rows and columns as if walking the city\u2019s grid-like streets.\n\nThe most esteemed sages of Rectanglia sought not just mere solutions, but the ultimate tally: the sum of all such bonds, counted across every possible valid arrangement of the K tokens. Their quest was to find this sum, but only as much as could fit within their enchanted numerary of modulus (10^9 + 7), for numbers beyond this veil were said to vanish into the aether, never to be retrieved.\n\nWhen visitors arrived to test their wits, the keepers of the board would greet them with three secrets written in the language of numbers: first, the size of the board\u2019s length (M), then its width (N), and finally the number of tokens (K). These three values, whispered in sequence and separated by silence, became the \u201cinput scroll.\u201d After deep calculation, the ultimate sum\u2014bounded by the modulus\u2014would be etched onto the \u201coutput slate,\u201d a single number revealing the total bond of separation as required by the Grand Game.\n\nTo guide newcomers, the sages offered ancient examples: Suppose the board was but two tiles by two, and only two tokens were placed. In this case, all possible arrangements were considered, and the sum of all bonds for every arrangement reached eight. In another legend, the board stretched as a single row of four, and three tokens were set upon it. There, the sum of separation bonds across all valid arrangements was found to be twenty.\n\nThus, the challenge of the Grand Game stands: Given the scroll of M, N, and K, calculate the total sum of all bonds of separation\u2014measured as described above\u2014across every possible valid arrangement, and reveal your answer upon the output slate, ensuring it abides by the ancient modulus. Those who can decode the mysteries of Rectanglia may yet become legends in their own right.",

For each placement, the Manhattan distance between the tokens is calculated and added to the total sum. The total sum is then returned modulo 10^9 + 7 to ensure it fits within the modulus.\n",
            "The problem is a combinatorial problem. We need to calculate the sum of Manhattan distances between all pairs of `k` points in a `m` by `n` grid. This can be solved by using combinatorics and dynamic programming.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def distanceSum(self, m: int, n: int, k: int) -> int:\n        mod = 10**9 + 7\n        dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]\n        for i in range(m):\n            for j in range(n):\n                for p in range(m):\n                    for q in range(n):\n                        dp[i][j] += abs(i-p) + abs(j-q)\n        return sum(sum(row) for row in dp) * k % mod\n```\n\nThis code first initializes a 2D array `dp` of size `m` by `n`, where `dp[i][j]` is the sum of Manhattan distances from point `(i, j)` to all other points in the grid. Then it calculates the sum of all distances and multiplies it by `k`, taking the modulus at the end to ensure the result fits within the modulus.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the grid starts at `(0, 0)` and the points are placed in a row-major order. If the grid starts at a different point or the points are placed in a different order, you would need to adjust the code accordingly.\n",

        "question_content": "In the bustling kingdom of Horologium, the Grand Plaza hosted a grand festival that spanned a precise stretch of time, from the first bell toll at dawn until the final chime at dusk\u2014let\u2019s call the total hours of sunlight the Festival Span. Throughout this span, a series of important council gatherings were scheduled, each with its own beginning and end, and all carefully arranged so that no two overlapped. The keepers of the schedule had recorded each council\u2019s reserved hours in two ancient scrolls: one detailing the moments of commencement, and the other marking the times when each gathering concluded.\n\nYet, the queen longed for the people to experience the greatest possible stretch of unbroken celebration\u2014the longest interval during the festival when the plaza would be empty and free for revelry. She summoned her cleverest advisors, explaining that while the gatherings must all occur as planned (and in the same order), she would permit them to discreetly shift the start time of a handful of meetings, but only for a select few\u2014no more than a certain number, which she called the Sacred Limit. The length of each meeting had to remain unchanged, no meetings could overlap, and none could spill beyond the festival\u2019s daylight hours.\n\nThe advisors\u2019 challenge was thus: Calculate, after shifting up to the permitted number of gatherings, what is the greatest length of uninterrupted merriment that could possibly fit anywhere during the Festival Span. They understood the rules: meetings must remain in the same sequence, cannot clash or exceed the day\u2019s bounds, and no more than the Sacred Limit may be repositioned.\n\nTo receive guidance from the kingdom\u2019s farthest reaches, the queen declared that all royal decrees about the schedule must follow a tradition:  \n**Input format:** The first scroll would record the Festival Span, the Sacred Limit, and the listings of all gatherings\u2019 start and end times.  \n**Output format:** The decree would then proclaim a single number\u2014the length of the longest possible period for unbridled celebration after all allowed adjustments.\n\nFor instance, one year the Festival Span was five hours, the Sacred Limit was one, and the council met from the first to the second hour, and once more from the third to the fifth. By shifting the earlier meeting to immediately follow the first, they created a two-hour window of freedom at the start\u2014this was the best possible.  \nIn another tale, the Festival Span stretched to ten hours; three meetings were held, and just one could be moved. By repositioning the second meeting to begin right after the first, an uninterrupted interval of six hours was opened for the people, from the third hour to the ninth.  \nBut sometimes, every hour was spoken for, as when five meetings lined up edge-to-edge across a five-hour festival, with the Sacred Limit matching the number of gatherings\u2014a rearrangement could not conjure even a moment for celebration.\n\nThus, the advisors were to seek, within the rules of Horologium, the grandest possible expanse of festivity\u2014a feat achievable only by clever rearrangement and strict adherence to the laws of the Plaza\u2019s timekeeping.",

The list is sorted in ascending order, with start times appearing before end times. The solution then iterates through the list, keeping track of the current count of meetings and the maximum free time.

The meetings are sorted by start time and end time.

The heap is sorted by the start time and end time of the meetings. The start time is used to ensure that the meetings are in the correct order, and the end time is used to break ties.\n\nThe solution iterates over the sorted events. If the start time of the current event is later than the end time of the earliest meeting in the heap, it means that the meeting can be moved to the start of the event. The end time of the meeting is then updated and pushed back into the heap.\n\nIf the size of the heap exceeds the Sacred Limit, it means that the earliest meeting cannot be moved anymore. The start time of the earliest meeting minus the end time of the previous meeting is then compared with the current maximum free time. The maximum free time is updated if the new interval is larger. The earliest meeting is then popped from the heap.\n\nFinally, the maximum free time is returned as the result.\n",

If two events have the same start time, the one with the larger end time comes first. This is to ensure that we can handle the case where two events start at the same time.\n\nThen we use a min heap to keep track of the end time of the events. The heap is initialized with the end time of the first event.\n\nFor each event, we first check if the start time of the current event is later than the end time of the earliest event in the heap. If it is, it means that the earliest event has ended and we can replace it with the current event. We then update the max end time and the free time.\n\nIf the start time of the current event is earlier than the earliest event in the heap, we simply add the current event to the heap.\n\nFinally, we return the max free time, which is the length of the heap.\n",

Then it uses a priority queue to track the maximum number of overlapping intervals. After that, it calculates the maximum free time by iterating through the sorted list of times and checking when the maximum number of overlapping intervals changes. The maximum free time is the maximum difference between two consecutive start times.\n",

The heap is sorted in ascending order of the start times and descending order of the end times. This ensures that the meetings are scheduled in the order of their start times and the earliest end times are at the top of the heap.\n\nFor each meeting, if the start time is greater than or equal to the end time of the meeting at the top of the heap, it means that the current meeting can be scheduled after the previous one. So, we replace the meeting at the top of the heap with the current meeting. Otherwise, we push the current meeting into the heap.\n\nAfter all meetings are scheduled, we calculate the free time by subtracting the end time of the meeting at the top of the heap from the maximum end time and adding it to the free time.

The meetings are sorted by their start times. For each meeting, if the start time is later than or equal to the earliest end time in the heap, the meeting can be moved to the next event. This means the meeting can be attended without interruption. The end time of the meeting is then added to the total free time. If the start time is earlier than the earliest end time, the meeting cannot be moved to the next event and the end time of the meeting is added to the heap. After all meetings are processed, the remaining free time is added to the total free time. The total free time is the maximum possible length of uninterrupted celebration.\n",

        "question_content": "In the ancient land of Numeria, there existed a great archive called the Division Hall, where knowledge and numbers were treated with almost magical reverence. The scholars of Numeria, known as the Calculists, were tasked with taming wild number-spirits that roamed in sequences. Each season, the Grand Ledger would present a series of mysterious decrees\u2014let us call them quests\u2014wherein a Calculist was given a starting and ending glyph, say the symbol L to the symbol R, and asked to summon all the number-spirits that resided between those two glyphs (including both, for in Numeria no spirit is excluded from such gatherings).\n\nHowever, these number-spirits were not easily subdued. The only way to pacify the entire summoned array was through a ritual called the Quartile Binding. In each binding, a Calculist would select two number-spirits, channel their legendary Division Wand, and *downgrade* each spirit's might to a quarter of its current strength, rounded down if necessary\u2014if a spirit was less than four, it would be reduced immediately to nothingness. This process would continue, each time requiring the Calculist to choose two spirits, until every spirit in the array was reduced to utter silence\u2014meaning, in Numerian terms, all had become zero.\n\nEach quest from the Grand Ledger was distinct, and the Calculists\u2019 goal was always the same: to complete every quest using the **smallest possible number of Quartile Bindings**, achieving this with elegance and efficiency, never wasting a single motion of their Division Wand. Once all quests were fulfilled, the Calculist would sum the binding totals from each quest, and present the grand sum as their answer to the Ledger\u2019s challenge.\n\nTo receive their instructions, a Calculist would be handed a scroll containing a sequence of quests. Each quest was inscribed as a pair of glyphs, representing the starting and ending spirits to be summoned. The Calculist would read the scroll as follows: The first line would indicate the number of quests (let us call this number N). Following lines would each contain two glyphs, representing the lower and upper boundaries (L and R) for each quest. Once all quests were completed, the Calculist would write a single number on a new scroll: the total minimum number of Quartile Bindings required for all quests combined.\n\nFor example, consider a scroll containing these quests:\n- First, summon the spirits between the glyphs inscribed as one and two.\n- Second, summon the spirits from two to four.\n\nThe Calculist would find, for the first quest, that a single Quartile Binding pacifies both spirits. For the second, two bindings would suffice for the three spirits summoned. The grand sum offered to the Ledger would be three.\n\nIn another, more challenging quest, if the scroll decreed the summoning of all spirits from two to six, the Calculist would find it takes four precise Quartile Bindings to tame them all.\n\nThus, in the hallowed halls of Numeria, the Calculist\u2019s art was measured not only in numbers, but in how deftly they could weave the fewest possible rituals to bring all spirits to rest\u2014each scroll\u2019s answer a testament to their wit and mastery over the ancient numerals.",

Therefore, the total number of operations required to fulfill a query is the sum of the strengths of the number-spirits in the query. Since the strengths of the number-spirits are integers, the total number of operations is also an integer.\n\nThis solution assumes that the strengths of the number-spirits are positive integers.

        "question_content": "In the far-flung realm of Arithmere, there lies a peculiar village known as the Ring of Numbers. This settlement is built upon a perfect circle, with a series of houses arranged around its edge. The villagers are a curious folk, for instead of names, each is known only by a number\u2014a value they wear proudly on a plaque above their door. The number of homes always respects the ancient tradition: there are never fewer than two nor more than a hundred homes in the ring. And each villager\u2019s number, whether positive or negative, is never greater in magnitude than one hundred.\n\nLife in the Ring of Numbers follows strict customs. Each night, as twilight deepens and lanterns flicker on, the villagers perform the Ritual of Differences. They gather in pairs\u2014each person comparing their number to the neighbor on their left. Yet since their village is circular, the last villager also turns to the very first, ensuring the chain is unbroken. The difference between neighboring plaques is always measured with respect to its magnitude, for numbers may rise or fall, but only the distance between them matters. And so, each pair quietly notes the gap between their values, counting not the direction but only how far apart their numbers lie.\n\nThe village elders, wise and vigilant, have declared a challenge for the Festival of Extremes. They wish to determine, among all pairs of neighboring homes in the circle, which pair experiences the greatest chasm between their numbers. The task is simple in its telling: discover the largest of all the nightly differences that can be measured between adjacent villagers, remembering always to include the leap from the final home back to the first. The one who can declare this maximum distance, swiftly and without error, will be lauded as the Sage of the Ring.\n\nShould you wish to join the challenge, you will first receive a scroll containing the count of homes\u2014let it be called N, a value from two to one hundred. Following this, the scroll lists the precise numbers displayed on each home, moving in order around the ring. Your answer must be a single number: the largest distance, in magnitude, found between any two neighbors\u2014no matter where the pair sits upon the circle.\n\nConsider the tale of the trio living at plaques one, two, and four, in that order. The gaps between them are measured: from one to two (a difference of one), from two to four (a difference of two), and, because the ring is unbroken, from four back to one (a difference of three). Of these, three is the largest, so three is the answer to proclaim. Or consider, instead, the ring with plaques reading minus five, minus ten, and again minus five. Between minus five and minus ten, the chasm is five; between minus ten and minus five, also five; and between minus five and minus five, it vanishes to zero. Here, the greatest chasm is five.\n\nThus, within the Ring of Numbers, the challenge is ever clear: given the count of homes and the numbers upon their plaques, declare the greatest distance\u2014measured not in miles, but in the absolute difference between neighbors\u2014encountered anywhere upon the ring. May your wits prove as sharp as the festival demands!",

        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Diagona, all matters of order and harmony were governed by the Council of Arrays, a guild of mathematicians who believed that the fate of their land was written within the sacred Square Tableau. This tableau, a grid of mystical numbers arranged in perfect square formation, was rumored to hold the city\u2019s fortunes\u2014provided its patterns adhered to the strict doctrines of the Council. Each day, a fresh tableau would be brought forth\u2014its dimension, known as N, always matching in width and height, and each cell inscribed with a number whose value could range from the depths of minus ten raised to the fifth power, to the heights of ten raised to the fifth.\n\nThe Council\u2019s law was twofold, governing two opposing triangles within the tableau. From the grandest bottom-left triangle, sweeping up to the noble center diagonal, the council demanded that every trail of numbers running diagonally (from bottom-left to top-right) be arranged so that each number was as great or greater than the next as the trail marches upward. In contrast, the top-right triangle, with its airy heights and hopeful disposition, called for its diagonals to be arranged in ascending order\u2014each number no less than the one before it as the trail climbed. These two edicts preserved balance between tradition and ambition, gravity and aspiration.\n\nIt was the task of the Arraykeeper to take any tableau presented and transform it\u2014if need be\u2014so that every diagonal, either in the grounding bottom-left or the striving top-right, would honor the Council\u2019s decrees. The bottom-left triangle, including the proud middle diagonal, must see its diagonals in descending order. Meanwhile, each diagonal of the top-right triangle, including the lone peaks, must rise in ascending order. If a diagonal contained but a single number, it was deemed in harmony by default.\n\nOn ceremonial days, Arraykeepers would receive tablets inscribed with the current tableau\u2019s size\u2014N\u2014and then each of the N rows, each holding N numbers, one row per line. Their duty was to return a new tableau, arranged row by row, with every number rightly placed according to the rules. The city\u2019s archivist would then inscribe this transformed tableau, ensuring the Council\u2019s vision for order was preserved for the day.\n\nConsider, for example, the day when a tableau was brought forth with the numbers:\n```\n3\n1 7 3\n9 8 2\n4 5 6\n```\nThe Arraykeeper, working by the Council\u2019s logic, would return:\n```\n3\n8 2 3\n9 6 7\n4 5 1\n```\nHere, the boldest bottom-left diagonal that ran from the bottom-left corner to the top-right was rearranged from [1, 8, 6] to [8, 6, 1]\u2014non-increasing, as tradition demanded. The top-right triangle\u2019s main diagonal, once [7, 2], was delicately adjusted to climb from [2, 7]. Every other diagonal with but one number was left untouched, for there was nothing to disturb their singular harmony.\n\nOn another day, with a tableau of:\n```\n2\n0 1\n1 2\n```\nThe rearranged tableau:\n```\n2\n2 1\n1 0\n```\nshowed the bottom-left diagonal [0, 2] descending from [2, 0], while the other diagonals by their nature needed no change. And in the simplest case:\n```\n1\n1\n```\nThere was no need for change; the lone number reigned supreme on its solitary diagonal.\n\nThus, through these rituals and transformations, the city of Diagona ensured that every tableau, no matter how unruly in origin, would ultimately reflect the Council\u2019s perfect balance of tradition and progress, descending and ascending, all within the sacred square.",

The bottom-left triangle is sorted by finding the maximum element in each row and swapping it with the current element. The top-right triangle is sorted by finding the minimum element in each row and swapping it with the current element.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input grid is a square matrix and that the size of the grid is greater than 0.

        "question_content": "In the ancient, clockwork city of Circulum, the citizens lived on a great wheel that spun endlessly, linking each of its numbered sectors into a perfect circle. Each sector bustled with its own distinct guild, identified by an emblem\u2014a number etched in silver upon their banners. Life was orderly in Circulum, and citizens prided themselves on the precise arrangement of sectors and the camaraderie that thrived among guild members scattered around the city's ring.\n\nEach year, the Council of Circulum issued a challenge to foster unity among the guilds. They would select a group of envoys and send them to various sectors, asking each envoy to discover the shortest possible stroll, moving clockwise or counterclockwise along the wheel, to reach another sector flying the same guild\u2019s banner as their own. If fate dictated that no such companion existed elsewhere on the wheel, the envoy was to report \u201cno kin found\u201d for that journey.\n\nThe council provided a set of scrolls\u2014each scroll inscribed with the emblems for every sector, and a parchment listing the positions the envoys would start from. The festival's task was then clear: for each envoy\u2019s starting point, determine the minimum number of sector gates they\u2019d need to cross, in either direction, to greet a fellow member of their guild. If no such fellow could be found (meaning the banner appears only once on the wheel), the envoy would etch a mark symbolizing solitude.\n\nFor this challenge, the city\u2019s archivists insisted on strict guidelines. The number of guild banners and the number of envoy positions would never exceed a certain large number, called N. Each banner\u2019s emblem would be a positive whole number, never exceeding a certain upper bound, and the list of envoy positions would always list valid sectors on the wheel. The envoys\u2019 answers would be recorded in a ledger\u2014one for each starting envoy\u2014each entry filled with either the shortest distance to a kindred guild or, if alone, the mark of solitude.\n\nThe council decreed the following process for the envoys and their scribes:\n- Inspect the list of banners for each sector (the silver emblems in order, one number for each sector, separated by spaces), and then the list of positions from which each envoy would start (again, numbers separated by spaces, each number representing a starting sector).\n- For each envoy, determine the least number of sector gates needed to reach another sector with the same guild emblem. If none exists, inscribe \u201c-1.\u201d\n\nTo clarify the tradition, the council offered examples. Consider the banners [1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2] and envoy positions [0, 3, 5]:\n- The first envoy starts at sector 0 (guild 1). Their nearest kin is two gates away, at sector 2.\n- The second envoy starts at sector 3 (guild 4). No other sector bears this banner, so they record \u201c-1.\u201d\n- The third envoy starts at sector 5 (guild 3). Their nearest kin is three gates away, at sector 1, crossing sectors 6, 0, and finally reaching 1.\n\nSo, the answers the scribes would record in the ledger: 2, -1, 3.\n\nIn another year, with banners [1, 2, 3, 4] and envoy positions [0, 1, 2, 3], each guild\u2019s banner appeared only once. Thus, each envoy, finding themselves alone, wrote only \u201c-1\u201d for their solitary journeys.",

The idea is to sort the queries by their left and right boundaries, and then for each query, iterate over the range [l, r] in the original array. If the number at index i in the array is the same as the number at the previous index of the same number in the array (which is stored in the prev array), then we update the answer for the current query.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting of the queries, and the space complexity is O(n) for the prev array.\n",

Then, for each query, it iterates over the range `[start, end]` and finds the smallest number in this range. The result for the query is the difference between the smallest number's index and the query's start index. If no such number exists, the result is `-1`.\n",

The prefix count is the number of times a number appears in the list up to that point. Then, for each query, it calculates the count of numbers in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) that appear in the list. The count is calculated by subtracting the prefix count of `l-1` from the prefix count of `r`. If `l` is 0, it simply uses the prefix count of `r`. The result is appended to the `res` list. The function finally returns the `res` list.\n",

        "question_content": "In the grand city of Numeria, every year the Royal Mathemagicians host the Festival of Frequencies. Citizens gather to witness the legendary \u201cArray Parade,\u201d where a procession of n enchanted lanterns is arranged in a long row along the main avenue. Each lantern glows with a specific hue, its brightness level recorded on the royal scroll. Notably, each lantern\u2019s brightness lies within the modest range from the first to the fiftieth notch, never dimmer nor brighter.\n\nOn the eve of the festival, the Queen announces a special challenge: she selects her favorite brightness, a magical value known as the \u201cKeystone.\u201d The event\u2019s objective is to make as many lanterns as possible shine at this Keystone brightness, but with a peculiar restriction: the Royal Luminarists may only cast their spell once, and only in a continuous stretch of lanterns. Casting the spell allows them to choose any sequence of neighboring lanterns\u2014perhaps from the third to the seventh lantern, or any other block\u2014and increase or decrease the brightness of all lanterns in that segment by the same amount, be it positive or negative.\n\nThe rules of this magical affair are strict but clear:  \n\u2013 The parade features N lanterns in a row, their brightnesses inscribed in order.  \n\u2013 The Keystone, a special integer between one and fifty, is chosen for the challenge.  \n\u2013 The Luminarists can select any consecutive run of lanterns (from any position to any position, as long as the starting lantern comes before the ending one), and then adjust all those lanterns by a single, shared amount of their choosing\u2014perhaps dimming, perhaps brightening.  \n\u2013 This operation may only be performed once and must affect at least one lantern.  \n\u2013 Their goal is to make as many lanterns as possible match the Keystone brightness once the magic has settled.  \n\u2013 The constraints of Numeria\u2019s magic are powerful, yet bounded: the lantern procession can be as short as one or as long as ten raised to the power of five, and lanterns\u2019 initial brightness and the Keystone itself never exceed the fiftieth notch.\n\nThus, the challenge for any aspiring Mathemagician is this: given the initial lineup of lantern brightnesses and the Keystone value, what is the greatest number of lanterns that can be made to match the Keystone after performing a single spell as described above? In other words, find the highest possible count of lanterns whose brightness equals the Keystone once the spell is cast on any chosen block.\n\nTo state the rules of input and output in Numeria\u2019s tradition: The royal record keeper first lists the number N (the total lanterns), followed by the N brightness values in order. On the next line, the Keystone value is declared. The response to the Queen must be a single number: the maximal possible count of lanterns glowing at the Keystone level after one spell.\n\nTo illuminate this with examples from past festivals:  \n\u2013 Suppose the lanterns glowed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and the Keystone chosen was 1. The clever Luminarists could diminish the brightness of the third through sixth lanterns by five notches, causing two lanterns to shine at the Keystone: the very first, and now the last after the spell.  \n\u2013 In another year, the lanterns started at 10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 2, and the Keystone was 10. By infusing an additional 8 notches upon the second through last lanterns, four lanterns could be made to glow at the Keystone brightness.\n\nThose who can uncover and declare the highest attainable count of Keystone lanterns\u2014using only this single spell\u2014will receive the city\u2019s highest mathematical honor for that year\u2019s festival.",

        "question_content": "In the vast land of Lettera, the Song of Harmony was sung every year to balance the spirits of the alphabet. Each village in Lettera was named after a lowercase letter, and at the annual festival, a messenger arrived with a list\u2014a sacred sequence of village names, the *Chant of Gathering*. The sequence, though simple at first glance, held deep mysteries in the distribution of voices from each village.\n\nThe elders of Lettera imposed special festival laws. Each village could send any number of delegates, but the true magic of the Song only emerged from the interplay of differences: The spirit of the festival depended on the rivalry between two champions. One champion had to come from a village with an even count of delegates, and the other from a village whose count was odd. The greatness of the Song, and thus the festival\u2019s success, was measured by how much more numerous the odd champion\u2019s followers were compared to the even champion\u2019s. Of course, the Song\u2019s magic required that there was at least one odd-numbered and one even-numbered village among the delegates. The elders decreed the Chant must be at least three notes long, but never longer than the time it takes to count a hundred.\n\nYour role as Lettera\u2019s master of ceremonies is to decipher the true potential of the Song given each year\u2019s *Chant of Gathering*\u2014a string of letters, each representing a delegate from a specific village. Your mission is to find, among all possible rivalries, the greatest possible advantage an odd champion\u2019s delegates hold over an even champion\u2019s. In other words, you must identify a village with an odd number of delegates, a different village with an even number of delegates, and report the largest difference between their numbers (odd minus even). The festival's magic is at its peak when this difference is as large as possible.\n\nWhen the Song is to be analyzed, the messenger presents the sequence as a single line\u2014the list of delegates, each denoted by their village\u2019s letter, all together with no spaces. At your command, you must return a single number: the greatest advantage the odd champion can claim over the even champion. This number is the measure of the Song\u2019s purest rivalry.\n\nLet us look at the echoes of past festivals. In one year, the chant was \"aaaaabbc\". The villagers from 'a' sent five delegates (odd), while 'b' sent two (even). No other pair achieved a greater advantage than this rivalry, so the magic number was three. In another year, the sequence was \"abcabcab\". Here, the 'a' villagers gathered three (odd), and the 'c' villagers two (even), for a magic number of one. \n\nIn summary, each festival, Lettera\u2019s Song is presented as a string:  \n**Input:** a single line of lowercase letters representing the delegates.  \n**Output:** a single integer, the greatest odd-vs-even delegate difference possible (odd minus even) among all such possible rivalries.  \n\nMay your calculations channel the true spirit of rivalry, bringing forth the strongest Song yet for Lettera!",

        "question_content": "In the sprawling city of Axis, citizens navigated its endless lattice of streets by strict tradition, always setting off from the Grand Plaza\u2014Axis\u2019s true center. Every step they took must be one of four: a stride North towards the hills, a march South toward the river, a venture East into the markets, or a trek West through the artisans\u2019 quarters. Each citizen\u2019s daily journey was recorded in a string of directions\u2014a personal map dictating their path from dawn\u2019s first step to twilight\u2019s return.\n\nBut a curious annual festival, the Day of Remapping, offered a unique twist: each participant could, through a rare magic called \u201cRewriting,\u201d alter a small number\u2014let\u2019s call it no more than K\u2014of these directional decisions. The power of Rewriting allowed a walker to swap any single step for any other, perhaps turning a Southbound regret into a Northbound ambition, or an unwise Western detour into an Eastern advantage. The challenge: to see, by clever use of these magical swaps, how far a citizen could get from the Grand Plaza at any moment during their journey\u2014measured not in straight lines, but in \u201cAxis Distance,\u201d the sum of vertical and horizontal blocks from the origin.\n\nThe city\u2019s council set forth the rules in a scroll, easy for all to understand:  \n\u2014 Each citizen receives, as input, a map of their journey (let\u2019s call this a string of directions), and a single number, K, indicating the maximum steps they may rewrite.  \n\u2014 The goal: determine the furthest Axis Distance one can reach from the Grand Plaza at any point along the rerouted journey, using no more than K magical rewrites.\n\nFor the festival, the council provided this example: Suppose a citizen\u2019s map read \u201cNWSE\u201d and their Rewriting quota was 1. By changing the southbound step to north, their journey would instead be \u201cNWNE.\u201d They would move north, then west, then north again, then east\u2014finding themselves, at the third step, three blocks from the Grand Plaza (a sum of two blocks north and one west, for a total Axis Distance of three), this being the greatest distance attainable on the journey.\n\nFor another citizen, their map was \u201cNSWWEW\u201d and their quota was 3. By rewriting a southbound step to north, and an eastbound step to west, their path transformed into \u201cNNWWWW,\u201d and they could reach a grand total of six Axis blocks from the Grand Plaza at their fourth step. Thus, the council\u2019s challenge was clear: use your allotted rewrites as cunningly as possible to maximize your distance from home, but remember, you may alter no more than your quota\u2014no cheating!\n\nIn summary, Axis\u2019s festival challenge is this:  \n**Input:** A single line containing the journey\u2019s string of directions (using only \u2018N\u2019, \u2018S\u2019, \u2018E\u2019, or \u2018W\u2019), followed by an integer quota for rewrites.  \n**Output:** The greatest Axis Distance from the Grand Plaza that can be reached at any step, after rewriting up to the allowed number of steps for maximal effect.\n\nAnd so, each year, clever citizens waited for the festival\u2019s sample scrolls\u2014showing not numbers and arrows, but the proud stories of those who had ventured furthest from the heart of Axis, their steps rewritten with wisdom and daring.",

The idea is to create two prefix and suffix arrays to store the count of each character from the start and end of the string respectively. Then for each possible window size from 1 to k, we count the number of characters in that window and update the maximum count. The maximum count is the maximum Axis Distance that can be reached.\n",

Then it iterates over all possible substrings of length k and checks if they can be formed by rewriting the letters in the string. If a substring can be formed, it updates the maximum distance.

It first calculates the prefix and suffix counts for each character in the string. Then for each character, it tries to find the maximum distance by binary searching. The binary search is based on the fact that if we can reach a character at position i with k steps, then we can reach any character at position j (i <= j <= i+k) with at most k steps.\n",

        "question_content": "**Background**\n\nIn the bustling realm of Numeria, every citizen is born with two unique tokens. The first is known as their Rank Insignia\u2014a number graven upon their badge\u2014and the second is their Fortune Gem, a crystal that gleams with a value unique to each person. In Numeria, comparisons of status and resourcefulness are the foundation of both alliances and rivalries; each citizen often wonders how their wealth might grow, if only they could borrow from those deemed \"lesser\" by the society\u2019s strict pecking order.\n\n**Rules and Problem Setting**\n\nAccording to Numerian law, for every individual, there exists a ritual of assessment. During this event, each participant must survey all others whose Rank Insignia is less than their own. For each such observer, it is customary to admire the Fortune Gems of the lesser-ranked citizens. The law, however, is precise: no one may admire more than K Fortune Gems during this ritual, no matter how many lesser-ranked citizens there are. In choosing which gems to admire, a Numerian is incentivized to select the most dazzling\u2014those with the highest values\u2014to maximize their perceived opulence.\n\n**Task Explanation**\n\nThe Grand Scribe is tasked with recording the results: for every citizen, they must determine the maximum combined value that could be admired from the Fortune Gems of those with lower Rank Insignias, by choosing at most K of the brightest among them. The tally for each citizen is to be carefully noted in a ledger, so that the wealth of opportunities is clear for all to see. In essence, every citizen seeks to know: \"If I could admire up to K gems from all who stand below me, and only the brightest, what is the greatest sum I could gather in my gaze?\"\n\n**Input and Output Format**\n\nThe Numerian census is relayed to the Grand Scribe in the following form:\n- First, the list of all Rank Insignias, in the order of citizen registration.\n- Second, the list of corresponding Fortune Gem values, matched one-to-one with the order of registration.\n- Lastly, the value of K, the maximum number of gems each citizen may admire.\n\nThe Scribe shall respond with a list of numbers, each one representing the maximal sum collectible in admiration for each corresponding citizen.\n\n**Examples and Closing**\n\nConsider, for instance, a festival with five citizens holding Rank Insignias of [4, 2, 1, 5, 3] and Fortune Gems valued at [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], with the ritual's limit set at two gems per person. The Scribe\u2019s ledger would read [80, 30, 0, 80, 50], signifying, for each citizen, the optimal sum that could be admired from those below them. For example, the first citizen (with Rank 4) may choose from the gems of citizens with Ranks 2, 1, and 3, selecting the two brightest gems valued at 50 and 30, thus totaling 80. There are cases where no one is of lower rank, such as the third citizen above, resulting in a sum of zero.\n\nIn another gathering, if all citizens share equal Rank Insignias, say [2, 2, 2, 2] with Fortune Gems [3, 1, 2, 3], and the admiration limit is one, then no citizen has anyone to look down upon; the Scribe\u2019s ledger would thus record [0, 0, 0, 0]. The tale of Numeria is thus a parable of social order and ambition\u2014each citizen\u2019s opportunities defined as much by their place in society as by the fortunes of those beneath them.",

The queue is sorted by gem value in descending order, so the top of the queue is the brightest gem. The solution iterates over the citizens, adding each one to the queue and removing the one with the lowest gem value if the queue becomes larger than k. If the queue is exactly k citizens, the solution calculates the maximum sum by summing the gem values of the citizens in the queue. The solution returns a list of the maximum sum for each citizen.\n",

        "question_content": "In the kingdom of Numeria, every decade, a grand festival is held, during which the clans of the realm gather their people into great processions. Each clan\u2019s assembly, known locally as a \u201cmarch,\u201d varies in size\u2014some are vast, some modest. The council also presents a collection of enchanted relics, each imbued with a number, each number representing a magical rhythm. The tradition is that every march must choose a relic whose rhythm can mark the steps of every marcher exactly; that is, the size of the march must be perfectly divisible by the rhythm of the relic.\n\nThe council has always decreed several important rules. Firstly, there exist **N** clans, each with their own march. The relics to choose from are **M** in number. Every march, regardless of its size, can select any relic, so long as the relic\u2019s rhythm fits perfectly into the march\u2014no marcher may be left unaccompanied or paired with a mismatched step. If more than one relic can serve a march, the clan elders must always select the relic that appears earliest in the council\u2019s procession (that is, with the smallest listing number). Should it happen that not a single relic suits a march, the clan must go without\u2014a great dishonor, marked with a tally of \u201c-1\u201d for the chronicles. Importantly, a relic\u2019s rhythm is so universal that it can serve multiple marches at once, should fate allow.\n\nYou, a scribe of Numeria, have been entrusted with a task. For a given year\u2019s festival, you are provided with a scroll listing the sizes of all **N** marches, and another listing the rhythms of all **M** relics in the order in which they are presented. For each march, you must determine which relic (if any) the clan should select, following the sacred rules. The council wishes to know, for each march, the listing number of the chosen relic (starting from the first relic as 0 for ease of recordkeeping). If no suitable relic is found for a march, you must enter \u201c-1\u201d for that clan. The council desires this record as a list of **N** entries\u2014one for each clan.\n\nWhen the council brings you the scrolls, they will present them in the following manner:  \nFirst, they will give the number of clans (**N**) and the number of relics (**M**).  \nNext, the sizes of the **N** marches (each a positive integer no greater than ten to the power of five), followed by the rhythms of the **M** relics (each a positive integer, also no greater than ten to the power of five).  \nYou must return a single line with **N** numbers: each number is the listing of the relic chosen for that clan\u2019s march, or \u201c-1\u201d if none can be chosen.\n\nLet us consider how these chronicles might read. Suppose the clans\u2019 marches are of sizes 8, 4, 3, 2, and 4, while the relics\u2019 rhythms are 4 and 2. The sacred record would note the relics chosen for each march as: 0, 0, -1, 1, 0\u2014meaning that the first, second, and fifth marches can use the first relic, the fourth march uses the second relic, and the third march cannot be matched. In another year, with marches of size 2, 3, 5, and 7, and relics of 5, 3, and 3, the record would be: -1, 1, 0, -1. Finally, with marches of size 10, 21, 30, and 41, and relic rhythms of 2 and 1, the great book would read: 0, 1, 0, 1.\n\nThus, the festival\u2019s harmony depends on your wisdom, the relics\u2019 rhythms, and the ancient law of division. May your records be clear, your logic sound, and the festival\u2019s processions wondrously matched.",

        "question_content": "In the kingdom of Arithmora, young strategists are summoned to the legendary Challenge Corridor, a mysterious stone hallway lined with enchanted pedestals. Each pedestal is marked with a distinct number of radiant gems\u2014these are the Points of Potential, and there are exactly N of them, arranged in a straight line. The number of gems on each pedestal varies; no fewer than one and never more than a million. Before the challenge, each pedestal\u2019s Score Crystal is empty and must be filled through cunning movement and careful planning.\n\nThe corridor\u2019s rules are strict and ancient. A strategist begins their journey just outside the leftmost pedestal\u2014at a place known as the Shadow Threshold. From here, they may step forward or backward, but only into the bounds of the corridor after their first move. With each move, a strategist must decide: step forward to the next pedestal or retrace their steps to the previous one. Each visit to a pedestal allows them to channel all of its gems into its Score Crystal, adding to its growing luminescence. But the total number of steps taken must never exceed M, a number declared at the start of each challenge and chosen by the Grandmaster\u2014never less than one, and sometimes stretching into the billions. The corridor itself, however, never has fewer than two or more than fifty thousand pedestals.\n\nThe strategist\u2019s ultimate task is to balance the Score Crystals\u2014to distribute the gem energies such that the dimmest crystal glows as brightly as possible. In other words, after taking no more than M moves, they must maximize the least-filled Score Crystal along the corridor. The strategist can strategize their steps\u2014moving forward and backward, revisiting pedestals, and pouring in the gems as many times as rules permit, seeking the configuration where the lowest score among all pedestals is as high as possible.\n\nTo undertake this challenge, the Grandmaster will first announce the sequence of Points of Potential (the gems on each pedestal) and the maximum number of moves, M. These are spoken aloud as the \"input\": first, the line stating the number of gems on each pedestal (in their corridor order), followed by the second line naming M. Upon succeeding, the strategist is to proclaim the single greatest possible value that the dimmest Score Crystal can achieve\u2014this is the \"output.\"\n\nConsider, for example, a corridor with two pedestals holding two and four gems, and a maximum of three steps allowed. The strategist might stride forward, invest in the first, then the second, and finally double back to the first, ending with both Score Crystals shining with a strength of four\u2014the greatest possible minimum. In another trial, with three pedestals bearing one, two, and three gems, and five moves allowed, the best strategy leaves the dimmest crystal glowing with two gems.\n\n**To summarize the ritual of input and output in Arithmora:**\n\n- **Input:**  \n  - The first line recites the sequence of gems on each pedestal (space-separated).  \n  - The second line names the total number of moves allowed.\n- **Output:**  \n  - A single number: the brightest possible minimum value among all Score Crystals after no more than the allowed moves.\n\n**Example from the corridors:**  \n- For a sequence of `\"2 4\"` and moves allowed being `3`, the answer called out is `4`.  \n- For a sequence of `\"1 2 3\"` and moves allowed being `5`, the answer is `2`, for that is the peak minimum brightness attainable.\n\nThus, the Challenge Corridor tests not just the steps, but the wisdom to spread light evenly\u2014striving for a brilliance that is as balanced and intense as destiny permits.",

        "question_content": "In the land of Axiomara, the ancient Order of the Equilibrians was tasked with a peculiar challenge. Across the vast marble plains stood numerous magical tiles, each one crafted in a perfect square\u2014some small as a coin, others as large as a house. Each tile was planted so that its bottom-left corner rested at a unique spot on the ground, and its edges aligned perfectly with the world\u2019s mighty axes. The Equilibrians were not concerned with the colorful patterns or the stones themselves, but rather with an age-old riddle: where to cast a spell that would split the land\u2019s total magic perfectly between sky and earth?\n\nThe rules of this test, laid down in their ancient scrolls, were strict: A council of N mages (where N could be as few as one or as many as fifty thousand) would each summon a single square. Each mage would specify three numbers: where on the eastern-western axis their square\u2019s lower-left corner would appear, where on the northern-southern axis it would rest, and how long each side would be (never less than one and never more than a billion). Sometimes the squares would overlap, and in those intersections, the shared magic would count again and again\u2014overlapping enchantments did not combine, but stacked atop one another.\n\nThe Equilibrians\u2019 sacred duty was to conjure a horizontal line\u2014a shimmering ribbon of balance\u2014at the lowest possible height, so that the power contained in all the tiles above the ribbon would exactly match the power beneath it. If there were many such heights, tradition demanded the lowest one. The wise ones agreed that, if the line was placed within a tile, only the part above or below would count accordingly. The precise splitting of power was critical; even the smallest imbalance was forbidden. For the spell\u2019s success, the difference between sky and earth magic must be less than a hundred-thousandth\u2014a tolerance famed across Axiomara.\n\nFor the ritual to commence, the council would announce their summoned squares using a scroll in the following fashion: First, the number of mages would be declared. Then, each of the N lines would contain three numbers, describing the x-position, y-position, and side-length for one square. When a scribe performed the spell and found the height of balance, they would inscribe this single number, accurate to five places after the decimal, on the response tablet.\n\nTo make the lesson clear, the elders shared these tales:\n\nIn one trial, two mages summoned squares\u2014one at the southern origin with a side of one, the other further north and east, also with a side of one. It was discovered that any ribbon drawn between the first and second would cut exactly half of each square\u2019s magic, and so the lowest such crossing was at height one. In another, a mage summoned a large square whose bottom kissed the ground, while another conjured a smaller one slightly to the north and east. After much calculation, the youngest scribe balanced the magicks at a ribbon height of about 1.16667, which the tally-stones confirmed split the powers above and below with perfect symmetry.\n\nSo, the young apprentice, when faced with a new set of summoned squares, must study the scrolls, consider all overlapping auras as many times as they appeared, and seek out the lowest possible height at which earth and sky share perfectly balanced power\u2014recording the answer to five places as is custom. Only then would the Order\u2019s eternal symmetry be maintained, and the spell be considered complete.",

It first sorts the squares by their x-position. Then it sets the minimum and maximum y-positions to the minimum and maximum y-positions of all squares. It then enters a loop where it calculates the midpoint of the current minimum and maximum y-positions. If the number of squares whose y-position is less than or equal to the midpoint and whose y-position plus side is greater than the midpoint is less than half the total number of squares, it sets the new maximum y-position to the midpoint. Otherwise, it sets the new minimum y-position to the midpoint. This process continues until the minimum and maximum y-positions are very close together. Finally, it returns the minimum y-position rounded to five decimal places.\n",

        "question_content": "In the grand city of Numeralis, nestled between rolling data hills and logic rivers, there stood a legendary vault known as the Matrix Treasury. Inside, the vaultkeepers arranged treasures in neat rows and columns\u2014a grid of priceless gems and artifacts. Each row represented the holdings of a noble house, each gem marked with a value denoting its worth. But the city\u2019s rulers, wary of greed and imbalance, imposed strict collection laws: each house declared how many treasures could be taken from its own holdings, and no collector could gather more than a fixed number of gems in total during a single expedition.\n\nThe laws of Numeralis were precise. For every noble house\u2014let\u2019s say there are N houses\u2014each had a vault row, with M treasures per row. The vaultkeepers presented these treasures as a visual grid, and for each house, an official decree declared the maximum number of treasures that could be drawn from their row, recorded in the Book of Limits. There was also a city-wide edict: no collector could take more than K treasures altogether, regardless of their value or which house they belonged to.\n\nCollectors from across Numeralis sought to maximize their fortune within these bounds. To succeed, a collector had to carefully select which treasures to claim: never exceeding the limit specified by any house, and never surpassing the total number of treasures allowed by the city\u2019s edict. The true goal, whispered in the marble halls, was to amass the highest possible sum of treasure values\u2014choosing wisely and efficiently, picking the most valuable gems, and respecting all the noble houses\u2019 decrees.\n\nThe city\u2019s archivists set forth a clear protocol for those wishing to test their luck in the Matrix Treasury:\n\n- First, present the vault\u2019s structure: the number of houses (N) and treasures per row (M), followed by the value of each treasure in its respective spot.\n- Next, reveal the Book of Limits: an array of N numbers, each showing the maximum treasures that can be taken from one house's vault.\n- Finally, state the city\u2019s collection cap, K.\n- After calculating your haul, return a single number: the highest sum of treasure values you could achieve, following all house and city limits.\n\nTo illustrate, consider these two tales from the vaults:\n\n**Tale One:**  \nA vault of two rows and two columns, with treasures worth 1, 2 (first row), and 3, 4 (second row). The first house allows only one treasure to be taken, the second allows two, and the city\u2019s edict forbids any collector from taking more than two in total. The wisest collector picks the two highest-valued gems\u2014the 4 and the 3, both from the second row, for a total value of 7.\n\n**Tale Two:**  \nNow imagine three treasures per row for two houses: treasures worth 5, 3, 7 (first row) and 8, 2, 6 (second row). Each house allows the collector to take up to two treasures from its vault, but no more than three in total. Here, the collector takes the 7 from the first row and the 8 and 6 from the second, achieving a grand sum of 21\u2014the richest haul possible under these rules.\n\nThus, through the careful balance of ambition and respect for the laws of Numeralis, wise collectors navigate the Matrix Treasury, always seeking to maximize their gain while leaving the vault\u2019s order undisturbed.",

The dp array is used to store the maximum sum of treasures that can be obtained from the first i houses and at most j treasures. The prefix sum is used to calculate the sum of treasures in a certain range.

        "question_content": "In the distant land of Numeria, the Royal Guild of Calculists faced a unique annual challenge: the Division of the Encoded Scrolls. Each year, the Guildmaster would hand out a series of sacred scrolls, each inscribed with two secret traditions. The first, called the Value of Essence, was a list of N runes\u2014each rune carrying a hidden power. The second, the Weight of Tribute, was a parallel scroll listing the labor required to honor each rune. Along with these, the Guildmaster decreed a magic constant, known only as the Arbitrator\u2019s Factor.\n\nGuild law dictated how the scrolls could be partitioned for the ritual. The Calculists could split the runes into several consecutive groups, called \u201csub-guilds,\u201d and for each sub-guild, a unique ceremony was performed. The cost of each ceremony followed an ancient Numerian formula: first, the Calculists would add up the essence of all runes up to the end of the current sub-guild (not just within the sub-guild, but all those before as well), then pour in the Arbitrator\u2019s Factor multiplied by the order of the sub-guild in the ceremony. This sum was then multiplied by the total tribute weight of the runes within that sub-guild. \n\nTo illustrate, for the ith sub-guild, consisting of runes from the lth to the rth, they would gather the essence from the first rune up through the rth, add the Arbitrator\u2019s Factor times the sub-guild\u2019s number, and then multiply this by the sum of tributes from the lth to the rth rune. Each sub-guild\u2019s ceremony thus demanded careful calculation, for the sum of all such ceremonial costs across all sub-guilds determined the overall burden for the Guild that year.\n\nThe Calculists\u2019 goal was to divide the scrolls into sub-guilds so that the *total* ceremonial cost was as low as possible. They could choose any number and arrangement of sub-guilds, so long as every rune was included in some group, and each rune belonged to exactly one sub-guild, preserving their order. The Calculists, ever wise, knew the importance of efficiency and sought to minimize the total cost with every division.\n\nTo join the contest, a Calculist would present the following:  \n\u2014 The first line, bearing the count of runes N and the Arbitrator\u2019s Factor K.  \n\u2014 The second line, listing the Values of Essence for each rune, from first to last.  \n\u2014 The third line, listing the corresponding Weights of Tribute.  \nUpon careful division, the Calculist would then announce a single number: the lowest possible total ceremonial cost for that year\u2019s scrolls.\n\nFor instance, one year\u2019s ritual involved three runes with values 3, 1, 4, tributes 4, 6, 6, and an Arbitrator\u2019s Factor of 1. The wisest Calculist split the scrolls into [3, 1] and [4]. The first ceremony\u2019s cost was calculated as: (3 + 1 + 1\u00d71) \u00d7 (4 + 6) = 50, and the next as: (3 + 1 + 4 + 1\u00d72) \u00d7 6 = 60, totaling 110, which was the minimum. In another fabled year, with nine runes and more intricate values\u20144, 8, 5, 1, 14, 2, 2, 12, 1\u2014tributes\u20147, 2, 8, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2\u2014and an Arbitrator\u2019s Factor of 7, the scrolls were best divided into [4, 8, 5, 1], [14, 2, 2], [12, 1]. The ceremonies cost 525, 250, and 210, summing to 985, the lowest possible.\n\nAnd thus, in Numeria, the Calculists\u2019 pursuit of the perfect ritual arrangement each year became a legacy of wisdom, strategy, and the relentless quest for efficiency.",

The check function checks if the total cost is less than or equal to k. If it is, then the mid value can be the minimum cost. If it's not, then the mid value is too high and we need to decrease it. The binary search continues until l is equal to r. The final result is l, which is the minimum cost.\n",

The check function calculates the total cost of changing each number in the array to the middle value (mid). If the total cost is less than or equal to k, it means we can achieve the target k by changing the numbers to the middle value. If the total cost is greater than k, we need to increase the middle value, so we set l = mid + 1. If the total cost is less than k, we need to decrease the middle value, so we set r = mid.

The `check` function calculates the total cost if the median is `mid`. If the total cost is less than or equal to `k`, it means we can achieve the target cost, so we update `r` to `mid`.

The binary search continues until the total cost is less than or equal to the previous total cost. The minimum total cost is then returned.\n"

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeralia, there existed a fabled guild called the Order of the Twin Mirrors. The guild was known for its cryptic initiation ritual, which every hopeful must pass to gain entry. This ritual revolved around a mystical string of digits\u2014a sequence of numbers whispered from one initiate to the next, stretching in length from just three up to as many as a hundred symbols in a line. The city\u2019s laws dictated that only such strings, composed solely of the purest single-digit numerals, could be used in this rite.\n\nWithin the hallowed halls of the Order, the aspirant would take their chosen digit-string and begin a sacred dance of numbers: they would pair the first and second figures, summing them and, if the result was greater than nine, take just the final digit (the remainder after dividing by ten). Then, the second and third numbers would be paired in the same fashion, then the third and fourth, and so on, always taking care to preserve the sequence in which these new digits were born. Each round of this ritual reduced the length of the string by one, as the numbers were whittled down and reshaped through their pairwise unions.\n\nThe initiate\u2019s challenge was to persist in this act of transformation until, at last, only two numbers remained within their string. At this point, the Guildmasters would lean forward, eyes keen, for the final test: if the last two digits were mirror reflections of each other\u2014identical in every way\u2014the trial was declared a success, and the initiate\u2019s passage was assured. If not, the aspirant would be gently turned away, counseled to attempt the rite again another day.\n\nTo participate in this hallowed tradition, a candidate would step forward and announce their initial string\u2014a sequence of digits spoken aloud. The Order would record this as the input. At the conclusion of the rite, the Guildmasters would respond with a single word: \u201ctrue\u201d if the numbers matched, \u201cfalse\u201d if they did not. Thus, the format for all records in Numeralia was simple:  \n**Input:** A line containing the digit-string.  \n**Output:** One word\u2014\u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nFor example, in one telling, an initiate presented the string \u201c3902.\u201d The numbers began their dance: first becoming \u201c292\u201d (as three and nine made two, nine and zero made nine, zero and two made two), and then transforming into \u201c11\u201d (as two and nine made one, and nine and two made one once more). Since these final two digits were perfectly matched, the Guildmasters declared \u201ctrue.\u201d\n\nIn another trial, a hopeful recited \u201c34789.\u201d Through successive rounds, the string became \u201c7157,\u201d then \u201c862,\u201d and finally \u201c48.\u201d The last pair, being different, led to the verdict \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nThus, through these tales, the rules and spirit of Numeralia\u2019s Order of the Twin Mirrors live on\u2014a testament to the power of transformation, and the pursuit of perfect symmetry.",

The Truthseekers are known for their ironclad honesty, always repeating a sacred phrase, while the Falsifiers twist tradition by never uttering the guild\u2019s anthem exactly as it was taught. Each year, the Archive\u2019s Keepers present a challenge: to craft the most harmonious chorus (a single song of letters) that honors both guilds\u2019 wishes.\n\nThe challenge is composed as follows: The Keepers display a parchment with a chain of n glyphs\u2014each glyph marked either by a seal of Truth or Falsehood\u2014and present the ancient anthem, a string of m mysterious characters. The chorus to be composed must be exactly n plus m minus one notes in length. For every glyph along the row, beginning from the first, the following must be observed: whenever a Truth seal is found, the line of m notes starting at that position must exactly echo the ancient anthem; whenever a Falsehood seal appears, the segment of m notes beginning there must *not* match the anthem note for note.\n\nEach composer must strive to weave the chorus so that all Truthseekers and Falsifiers are satisfied\u2014never missing any demand, yet always seeking the most melodious arrangement. In the Archive\u2019s tradition, the most melodious chorus is defined as the one that would come first if all possible choruses were arranged alphabetically. Should it prove impossible to satisfy every guild member, the composer must present only silence.\n\nWhen a composer enters the Archive\u2019s Hall, the Keepers pose the challenge thus: \"You will be given the row of seals (the string of Truth and Falsehoods) and the ancient anthem (the mysterious string). Each is delivered as follows:  \n\u2014 The first line details the row of seals (only T or F marks, of length n).  \n\u2014 The second line displays the ancient anthem (a string of lowercase English letters, of length m).  \nYou must return a single line: the most melodious chorus you can craft to satisfy all guilds, or an empty line if it cannot be done.\"\n\nTo illustrate:  \nSuppose the row reads:  \n`TFTF`  \nand the anthem is:  \n`ab`  \nThe most melodious chorus is:  \n`ababa`  \n\u2014 for every Truth seal, the matching segment is \u201cab,\u201d and for every Falsehood, the segment is \u201cba\u201d\u2014distinct from the anthem. If the anthem were \u201cabc,\u201d however, no chorus could satisfy the conflicting demands, and the result would be silence. If the row consists of only one Falsehood and the anthem is \u201cd,\u201d the quietest, simplest chorus\u2014just \u201ca\u201d\u2014would suffice.\n\nThus, in the city of Lexica, harmony is found only by honoring each seal\u2019s decree with perfect precision\u2014while always seeking the gentlest melody that fulfills all.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Lexicoria, every year the Festival of Hidden Words unfolds\u2014a grand event where guilds compete in the art of Enigma Weaving. Here, each guild is given a sacred scroll inscribed with a sequence of mystical runes arranged in a single line, their number always lying between twice and fifty-thousand times ten squared. Only the youngest letters of the realm\u2014those twenty-six unique lowercase spirits\u2014are ever chosen for these scrolls. Along with the scroll, each guild is handed a secret decree: a number, never negative and never greater than the count of unique letters, dictating the exact tally of \"hidden sigil clusters\" they must unearth.\n\nThe rules of this ancient trial are strict and steeped in tradition. A hidden sigil cluster is a consecutive segment of runes, smaller than the entire scroll, in which each rune, once plucked for the cluster, must forever vanish from the world outside that cluster\u2014no whispers or echoes of its form may linger elsewhere in the scroll. Furthermore, the discovery of one cluster cannot taint the ground of another: each must be plucked from places untouched by others, ensuring that all clusters are disjoint. The decree's number signifies how many such pure clusters each guild must reveal, neither more nor less.\n\nTo triumph in the Festival, a guild must determine if their scroll permits the discovery of precisely the number of hidden sigil clusters revealed by the decree, following all the laws of separation and singularity. Only if this feat is possible\u2014extracting the mandated number of untouched clusters\u2014may the guild claim victory for their house.\n\nWhen the festival begins, each guild reads their scroll and decree aloud. For instance, suppose a guild is presented the scroll bearing 'abcdbaefab' and is decreed to find two clusters. In this case, the guild can triumph by uncovering the segments 'cd' and 'ef', for the runes 'c', 'd', 'e', and 'f' are each confined to their chosen clusters, never to be found elsewhere in the scroll. Thus, the decree is fulfilled, and the answer is a resounding affirmation.\n\nYet, not all are so fortunate. Should a guild face a scroll inscribed 'cdefdc' and a decree demanding three clusters, they would search in vain. At most, two clusters\u2014'e' and 'f'\u2014can be found, since the other runes echo elsewhere in the scroll and cannot be isolated without overlap. Here, the decree cannot be satisfied, and the guild must accept defeat.\n\nAnd in rare cases, such as a decree decreeing zero clusters, the judges accept an empty triumph: the absence of clusters is always permitted, for even in silence, the will of the decree is met. Thus, the guilds of Lexicoria measure their wits and wisdom, each challenge a dance between the scroll\u2019s secrets and the decree\u2019s demands.\n\n**Festival Rituals: The Ritual of Declaration**\n- Each guild must declare, in their ceremonial tongue:\n    - The scroll\u2019s rune sequence as a single word.\n    - The decree as a solitary number on the next line.\n- Upon unrolling the scroll and reviewing the decree, the council will respond with a single word: \"true\" if the decree can be met, \"false\" otherwise.\n\n**Festival Annals:**\n- For the scroll \"abcdbaefab\" and decree 2, the council wrote \"true,\" for the clusters 'cd' and 'ef' were found.\n- For the scroll \"cdefdc\" and decree 3, \"false,\" for only two clusters could emerge.\n- For the scroll \"abeabe\" and decree 0, \"true,\" as the decree\u2014requiring no clusters\u2014was fulfilled by default.",

The window is expanded by moving the right pointer until the number of unique characters in the window is greater than or equal to the maximum count of any character in the window. Then, the window is shrunk by moving the left pointer until the window size is less than or equal to the maximum count of any character in the window multiplied by k.

        "question_content": "In the sprawling kingdom of Numeria, the High Oracle presided over the ancient Ritual of Harmony\u2014a ceremony performed whenever disorder threatened the Sacred Sequence, a line of magical stones each inscribed with a number. Each stone\u2019s power was determined by its number, and for peace to reign, the Oracle demanded that the stones line up such that no stone ever shone dimmer than the one before it. The length of this sequence, denoted by N, was always between one and the legendary number fifty, while each stone\u2019s value ranged from a chilling negative thousand to a blazing positive thousand.\n\nEach year, the Ritual gave the Order Keepers a singular power: they could merge any neighboring pair of stones whose combined aura (that is, their sum) was the faintest among all neighboring pairs. If several pairs tied for the weakest sum, the Keepers always merged the pair nearest the head of the line. The merged pair would vanish and be replaced by a new stone, its inscription gleaming with the sum of the pair\u2019s original numbers. This fusion could be performed as many times as necessary, so long as the stones did not yet shine in perfect, non-fading harmony.\n\nThe Oracle\u2019s challenge was clear: determine the fewest magical fusions needed to transform any chaotic line of stones into a perfectly harmonious sequence\u2014one where each stone\u2019s brightness was equal to or greater than the one before it. The Ritual was not about mere completion, but about achieving balance with the least possible disturbance, preserving as much of the ancient stones\u2019 individual magic as Numeria\u2019s laws allowed.\n\nTo consult with the Oracle, a Keeper would present their stones to the Sacred Table as follows: first, a single number indicating how many stones were in the line (N), then, on the next line, the stones\u2019 values\u2014all inscribed in order from head to tail. The Oracle would respond with a single number, the least number of fusions required for harmony.\n\nConsider, for instance, a line of four stones with inscriptions 5, 2, 3, and 1. The Order Keepers first merged the third and fourth stones, whose combined light was dimmest. This produced a new sequence: 5, 2, 4. Again, the dimmest adjacent pair\u2014now the second and third stones\u2014were merged, creating 5, 6. In just two fusions, the sequence achieved harmony, and the Oracle would declare \"2\" as the answer.\n\nIn another year, a Keeper arrived with three stones: 1, 2, and 2, each already brighter or equal to the one before. The Oracle, recognizing the inherent harmony, required no fusions at all and thus pronounced \"0\" as the answer.\n\nAnd so the Ritual continued, a test of both wisdom and restraint. For each procession of stones, the Oracle awaited the Keeper\u2019s orderly recounting of the number of stones and their values, prepared to reveal the least number of magical fusions needed for Numeria to bask once more in the light of peace.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Numeria, there existed a curious contest known as the \u201cTrial of Pairs.\u201d The city\u2019s elders, seeking wisdom and cunning, would present a challenger with a row of enchanted stones. Each stone bore a different number, inscribed with a magical value representing its inner strength. The number of stones offered by the elders was always somewhere between one and a thousand, and each stone\u2019s strength could be as powerful as a million\u2014or as humble as one.\n\nThe rules of the trial were as intricate as Numerian tradition itself. At every stage, the challenger could gaze upon only the first three stones of the line. From this trio, the challenger had to select any two and cast them out together. Each time this was done, the spirit of the stones would demand a toll: the higher strength of the two banished stones would be claimed as the cost. If, at any point, there were fewer than three stones left, the challenger was compelled to remove all the remaining stones in one final act, paying as cost the mightiest among them. The game would end only when the last stone had vanished.\n\nThe challenge was not merely to clear the row of stones, but to do so with the least sum of sacrifices. The wise of Numeria knew that the order in which stones were paired and banished could greatly affect the total toll demanded by the spirits. Thus, the trial was as much about strategy as it was about brute force\u2014requiring the challenger to consider every pairing and every possibility, ever mindful that each decision rippled toward the final cost.\n\nShould you, traveler, wish to test your mettle at the Trial of Pairs, the elders would expect you to approach their table in a precise manner. You must first announce the count of stones you bring, followed by the strengths of each stone in the order they lie before you. In the language of the elders: the first line must declare the number of stones, and the second line must list their strengths, separated by spaces. When the trial is done, you are to declare only the minimum total cost required to banish all the stones, a single number on a line of its own.\n\nLet us recall the legend of two challengers. In one tale, a traveler faced stones with strengths of six, two, eight, and four. The traveler first removed the mightiest pair among the first three\u2014six and eight\u2014paying a cost of eight. Left with two and four, these last stones were cleared together for a cost of four. Thus, with careful planning, the total toll paid was twelve. In another tale, a challenger faced two, one, three, and three. Choosing to first banish the pair with strengths two and one, the challenger paid a cost of two, and then finished by removing the last two stones at a cost of three, for a total of five.\n\nThus, in the city of Numeria, the Trial of Pairs stands as a testament to the power of wise choices, and the enduring value of seeking the path of least sacrifice. Those who master this challenge are celebrated, for they have shown the rare gift of strategy amidst constraint.",

The cost of banishing the stones is the sum of the strengths of every third stone (starting from the third one), because every third stone is the one with the highest strength.

        "question_content": "In the distant realm of Alternia, there dwelled a guild of mystics known as the Summalancers, famed for their mastery over the Numbers\u2014a magical force that governed the fortunes of the land. Each year, the Guildmaster would assemble a council, presenting them with a sequence of enchanted stones, each inscribed with a potent value. It was the council's sacred challenge to select at least one stone and arrange them into a spellcasting chain whose energies would oscillate in perfect harmony.\n\nThe ritual demanded that the spell\u2019s power, as measured by the \"alternating harmony,\" was achieved by adding the magic from stones placed at the first, third, fifth, and so on positions, and then subtracting the magic of those at the second, fourth, sixth, and so forth. The council was tasked with forming a chain where this alternating harmony equaled the precise resonance decreed by the Guildmaster\u2014called the \"Key Resonance.\" Yet, the ritual imposed a vital restriction: while the stones could be woven into any order taken from their sequence, the resulting conjuration\u2019s raw magical energy\u2014calculated as the product of the chosen stones\u2019 values\u2014could never exceed the legendary Capstone Limit, lest the spell burst uncontrollably.\n\nThe Guildmaster's decree was clear: the council must discover a chain of stones that not only achieves the Key Resonance through alternating harmony, but also yields the mightiest possible raw energy without ever breaching the Capstone Limit. If no such chain could be formed, the council was to return with news of their failure, marked by the guild\u2019s symbol of -1.\n\nTo formalize the ritual for posterity, the Guild inscribed their tradition thus: The input begins with the number of stones, followed by the values written upon each stone, the Key Resonance required, and the Capstone Limit. The response to the ritual is a single number\u2014either the supreme energy achieved in accordance with all rules, or -1 should the feat prove impossible.\n\nConsider three visions from Alternia\u2019s history:  \n_First Vision_: The council faced stones marked 1, 2, and 3, with a Key Resonance of 2 and a Capstone Limit of 10. They found that by weaving all stones into a chain, the alternating harmony (1 minus 2 plus 3) reached precisely the Key Resonance, and the product (1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3) was 6\u2014well within the Capstone Limit. Alternatively, a single stone could be used; yet, the mightiest conjuration remained 6.\n\n_Second Vision_: When faced with stones 0, 2, and 3, and a Key Resonance of -5, the council searched every possible chain, but none met the resonance. The ritual failed, and they returned with -1.\n\n_Third Vision_: Stones bearing 2, 2, 3, and 3 were presented, with a Key Resonance of 0 and a Capstone Limit of 9. The council found multiple qualifying chains\u2014two 2s, two 3s, or all four stones. While the full chain produced the correct resonance, its energy (36) surpassed the Capstone Limit. The next strongest chain, two 3s, offered both the required harmony and a product of 9\u2014the mightiest within bounds.\n\nThus, the Summalancers\u2019 ritual balanced both precision and power, ever wary of the boundaries that kept their magic safe.",

It first sorts the input list of numbers. Then it initializes a list `dp` of size `k+1`, where `dp[i]` is the maximum product of `i` numbers that is less than or equal to the limit. The `dp` list is initialized with 0s.\n\nThen it iterates over the sorted list of numbers and for each number, it iterates over the `dp` list in reverse order. For each number, it checks if the previous maximum product `dp[j-1]` is not 0 and the product of `dp[j-1]` and the current number is less than or equal to the limit. If it is, it updates `dp[j]` with the maximum of `dp[j]` and the product of `dp[j-1]` and the current number.\n\nFinally, it returns `dp[k]` if it is not 0, otherwise it returns -1. This is because if `dp[k]` is 0, it means that there is no way to get a product of `k` numbers that is less than or equal to the limit.\n",

The solution iterates through the list, multiplying the `total` by the smallest and largest numbers in the list until the product exceeds the `limit`. If the product exceeds the limit, the solution returns -1. If the `l` pointer exceeds the `r` pointer, the solution breaks the loop and returns the `total`.\n",

The `maxProduct` method uses binary search to find the position of a given number in a sorted list. The `alternatingSum` method calculates the alternating sum of a list of numbers. The `maxAlternatingSum` method calculates the maximum alternating sum of a list of numbers. The `solve` method calculates the product of the first `k` numbers in a sorted list, and returns the count of numbers whose product exceeds a given limit. The `solveProblem` method is the main method that solves the problem by calling the above methods and returning the result.\n",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeralis, a peculiar festival is held every year in the Court of Parity. Citizens from all districts gather, carrying with them a string of relics\u2014each an ancient token inscribed with a number. These numbered relics are said to determine one\u2019s path for the coming year; thus, the Ritual of Division is a matter of great importance.\n\nThe city\u2019s sages have set forth strict traditions for the ritual. For every citizen, the number of tokens they bear, let\u2019s call this N, must be at least one and never more than one hundred. Each relic\u2019s inscription must be a positive integer, always at least one and never exceeding one thousand, as decreed by the High Mathemagi. The Parity Council, ever devoted to the art of segmentation, insists: each relic must be judged by its number. If the number is a friend of Evenness, it is to be cleansed, its power reduced to a pale, empty zero. If instead it is an ally of Oddness, it is to be emboldened, shining with the mark of one\u2014the number of individuality.\n\nAfter this transformation, the Keeper of Order, known for her meticulous attention, arranges all the altered relics in the grand display hall. She must follow a precise doctrine: the relics must lie in a row such that every zero comes before every one, never breaking the natural flow from emptiness to unity. Her aim is to ensure the arrangement is as orderly as possible, with not a single zero out of place before a one.\n\nFor those wishing to perform the ritual, the Parity Council provides a scroll of instruction:  \n**Input:** First, inscribe a single integer N (the count of relics). On the next line, list N integers\u2014each representing a relic\u2019s number, separated by spaces.  \n**Output:** After completing the ceremony, proclaim a single line of N numbers, each being either zero or one, arranged from emptiness to unity as the rules dictate.\n\nConsider, for example, a family who arrives with four relics inscribed with the numbers 4, 3, 2, and 1. The sages would transmute the relics: the tokens with 4 and 2 become zeros, while those with 3 and 1 become ones. The Keeper then lines them up as 0, 0, 1, 1, reflecting perfect order.\n\nAnother group, bearing five relics with the numbers 1, 5, 1, 4, and 2, sees the numbers 4 and 2 transformed to zeros, and the rest to ones. The display then becomes 0, 0, 1, 1, 1\u2014a sequence of emptiness rising to unity, as tradition demands.\n\nSo it is that the Ritual of Division is performed\u2014each relic judged, transformed, and arranged\u2014so that Numeralis may begin its year balanced, its citizens\u2019 fortunes mapped cleanly from zero to one.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling kingdom of Crustalia, there was a grand and peculiar contest known as the Feast of Fours, revered by all who boasted hearty appetites and clever minds. This centuries-old tradition invited participants to a banquet hall lined with *N* sumptuous pizzas, each crafted with a different weight of magical ingredients. The keepers of the contest, meticulous in their planning, always ensured that the total number of pizzas in the hall was a multiple of four, to honor the sacred number of the festival. \n\nThe rules of the Feast were as unique as the event itself. Each day\u2014no exceptions\u2014the contestant would be required to devour exactly four pizzas, no more and no less. There was a twist, however: the magical metabolism bestowed by Crustalia\u2019s ancient wizards allowed the contestant to gain the benefit of just a single pizza\u2019s weight from every four consumed. But which pizza\u2019s weight would count depended on the day\u2019s number. On the odd-numbered days of this feast (which started from the very first day), the wizard\u2019s magic would channel the strength of the heaviest pizza consumed that day. On even days, it would draw power from the second heaviest. This arcane law was designed to test not only one\u2019s appetite, but one\u2019s strategy in grouping the pizzas for maximum gain.\n\nThus, the challenge before every participant was this: with a list of all pizza weights laid out before them (ranging from the lightest, no less than one unit in weight, up to the heaviest, no more than a hundred thousand units), they must divide the pizzas into groups of four, to be eaten day by day, such that their total weight gain\u2014according to the magic\u2019s rules\u2014was as large as possible. The wizards demanded that every single pizza be eaten once and only once, and no pizza could be left behind, lest a curse fall upon the careless feasters.\n\nFor every challenger hoping to claim the title of Feastmaster, the ritual began with a parchment listing the sequence of pizza weights. This was the *input* to the contest. Each challenger would announce their total magical weight gain after the feast (the *output*), having planned their groupings for the largest possible total. The parchment would start with the number of pizzas, followed by the exact weights in order; the answer would be a single number: the maximum magical weight that could be gained by eating all pizzas in optimal groupings.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a feast with eight pizzas, with weights inscribed as: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. One wise challenger grouped the pizzas as follows: on the first day, they ate 2, 3, 5, and 8, gaining the strength of 8. On the second day, they consumed 1, 4, 6, and 7, gaining the magical benefit of 6. Their total weight gain was thus 8 plus 6, equaling 14\u2014the optimal result. In another contest, the pizza weights were: 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. The challenger cleverly paired 1, 1, 1, and 2 on day one (gaining 2), and the remaining four 1\u2019s on day two (gaining 1), totaling a gain of 3.\n\nEach champion of Crustalia walked away knowing that their prowess was measured not merely in the number of pizzas devoured, but in the sum of the magical weight gained, determined by their cunning in facing the Feast of Fours. And so, the legend grows, as each new challenger strives for the most efficient\u2014and delicious\u2014victory.",

        "question_content": "In the distant realm of Quadratia, the Royal Court gathers on the edge of a perfect, enchanted square\u2014the Kingdom\u2019s famed Parade Ground. This ground is bordered by four proud walls, each stretching from the grand origin stone to the farthest ceremonial spire, their length set by the Keeper\u2019s Number, N. Along these sacred walls, noble families are invited to present their brightest banners at marked locations, each one uniquely situated and precisely recorded in the Court\u2019s great ledger as a pair of magical coordinates.\n\nYet this year, a special challenge stirs the Court. The Grand Vizier, wishing to display the kingdom\u2019s unity and splendor, decrees that K banners must be hoisted for the All-Realm Festival. These banners, however, must be chosen from the heralds already positioned along the Parade Ground\u2019s boundary. The Vizier, seeking not just beauty but also harmony, commands that the chosen banners be as far from each other as possible\u2014measured not by the shortest path, but by the Festival\u2019s own traditional counting: the sum of the steps one must take east or west and then north or south, known to all as the Manhattan Stroll.\n\nThe rules, thus, are clear: From the gathered collection of honored banners, at least four and up to a limited multitude (no more than the number of families or 25, whichever is less), select exactly K banners so that the closest two\u2014by the kingdom\u2019s step-by-step measure\u2014are as distant as can be. The Festival\u2019s judges wish to maximize this minimum separation, ensuring the banners are both proud and not crowded, while never exceeding the boundaries set by the walls. Of note, every recorded banner must fall precisely on the Parade Ground\u2019s edge, and never shall two banners share a spot.\n\nTo take part in the challenge, each herald delivers to the Vizier a scroll listing: first the value N (the length of the ground\u2019s edge), then a list of all their banners\u2019 placements as pairs of numbers, and finally, the proud number K. The Vizier\u2019s task is to determine\u2014and announce\u2014the greatest possible value of the smallest step-based distance between any two banners, should K be chosen with wisdom. The answer is a single number, the maximal minimum separation achievable.\n\nFor example, when the edge length is 2 and the four ancient corners are marked as [[0,2],[2,0],[2,2],[0,0]], with a requirement to choose all 4 banners, the Vizier proclaims the answer is 2\u2014each banner stands boldly apart at the corners. In another case, with banners at [[0,0],[1,2],[2,0],[2,2],[2,1]] and K set to 4, the answer decreed is 1, for that is the greatest minimal distance possible given the crowding. Similarly, a Parade Ground of edge 2, banners at [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[2,0],[2,2],[2,1]], and K as 5, yields again the answer 1.\n\nThus, the Royal Court challenges you: Given the boundaries and banner placements, and the number of banners to display, can you discern the greatest distance possible between any two chosen flags? Present your solution as the Vizier would: a single number, the height of harmony for the Festival.",

It then calculates the maximum Manhattan distance between any two points in the k_closest list. The Manhattan distance is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the points are given in a 2D plane. The distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance, which is the straight line distance between two points in a plane.\n\nAlso, this solution assumes that the points are given in a 2D plane and that the origin (0,0) is the point of reference.

It then calculates the maximum possible distance between any two points and initializes two pointers at the start and end of the points list. The solution then enters a while loop, which continues until the right pointer is at the end of the points list. Inside the loop, the solution checks if the maximum distance between the i-th and j-th points is less than or equal to the result. If it is, the distance is appended to a list of distances and the right pointer is incremented. If the maximum distance is greater than the result, the left pointer is incremented. After the loop, the distances list is sorted in ascending order. If the number of points is less than or equal to k, the result is returned. Otherwise, the solution returns the maximum distance between the k-th and (k+1)-th points in the distances list.\n",

The largest distances are popped from the queue until we have k distances left. The smallest of these k distances is the maximum distance between any two chosen flags.\n\nThis solution assumes that the points are distinct. If there are duplicate points, the solution may not work correctly.\n",

The maximum distance between any two points is then calculated by iterating over all pairs of points and calculating the Manhattan distance between them.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting of the points, and the space complexity is O(k) for storing the k closest points.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the points are given in a 2D plane. If the points are in a different space, the distance calculation will need to be adjusted accordingly.\n",

It then uses two pointers, one at the start of the list and one at the end. It calculates the Manhattan distance between the points at the two pointers and compares it to the side length. If the Manhattan distance is less than the side length, it means the points are too close and the left pointer is moved to the right. If the Manhattan distance is greater than or equal to the side length, it means the points are too far and the right pointer is moved to the left. The result is updated with the maximum Manhattan distance found. The process continues until the two pointers meet. The result is the maximum Manhattan distance found, which is the greatest possible distance between any two chosen flags.\n",

The pointers move towards each other, always choosing the point that is closer to the origin. The maximum distance found is the result.\n",

        "question_content": "Long ago, in the kingdom of Permutaria, the annual Grand Procession was held\u2014a parade where the noble children of the land (numbered one through N by age) were called to march through the city\u2019s Heartway in a strict, tradition-bound order. This event was not simply a matter of pageantry: it was a puzzle, for the Royal Edict of Alternation decreed that no two children who marched side by side could both be of the same \u201cessence\u201d\u2014that is, they could not both be odd-aged or both be even-aged. The entire realm delighted in this challenge, for it ensured that every year\u2019s arrangements brimmed with novelty and care.\n\nHowever, for this particular festival, the Royal Mathemagician has posed an especially curious task. Among all possible lineups that followed the Law of Alternation (so that every pair of neighbors in the parade was always an odd-aged and an even-aged child, never two of the same), the Mathemagician requested the K-th most proper arrangement\u2014where \u201cproper\u201d followed the ancient lexicon, meaning the order in which the lineups would appear in the grand Book of Arrangements, sorted as one would list numbers from smallest to largest, comparing each child\u2019s age in turn.\n\nThe challenge was made all the more daunting by the constraints of Permutaria: the number of noble children, N, could be as small as one or as grand as one hundred, and the Mathemagician\u2019s curiosity could reach as high as the K-th arrangement, where K might be a number up to the magnitude of ten raised to the fifteenth power. Should there be fewer than K valid arrangements, the Mathemagician demanded an empty scroll\u2014signifying the impossibility of such a request.\n\nTo assist the royal court, the Herald would announce each year\u2019s puzzle in a precise ritual: first, the number of noble children, followed by the number of the arrangement sought\u2014both numbers spoken aloud and recorded upon parchment (Input: first the value for N, then for K). Once the solution was determined, the parade order would be written out as a procession of ages (Output: the lineup as a list of ages), or, should the Mathemagician\u2019s wish be too extravagant, the Herald would instead present a blank parchment (an empty list).\n\nTo illuminate this custom, the Master of Records preserved the following chronicles as examples:  \n\u2014 On the year when N was four and the K-th arrangement sought was the sixth, the correct parade order was three, four, one, two, for this was the sixth in the precisely sorted list of valid processions.  \n\u2014 In a festival with three noble children and the second arrangement requested, the parade order was three, two, one.  \n\u2014 But in the rare case where only two children were present, and the Mathemagician asked for the third arrangement, such excess could not be granted\u2014there were but two possibilities, thus the answer was an empty scroll.\n\nSo stands the challenge for all future Grand Processions: to determine, given the number of noble children and the desired arrangement\u2019s position, the exact sequence\u2014or admit when the request is beyond the realm\u2019s combinatorial bounty.",

It creates a list of numbers from 1 to n. Then it iteratively removes the number at the index that is k // factorial(i - 1) from the list and appends it to the permutations list. The index is calculated by dividing k by the factorial of i - 1. The value of k is then updated by subtracting the index times the factorial of i - 1.

It creates a list of children, then pops the appropriate child from the list and appends it to the result list. The index of the child to pop is calculated by dividing the desired position by the factorial of the remaining number of children. If the desired position is a multiple of the factorial, the index is the quotient, otherwise it is the quotient plus one. The remainder of the division is then used as the new desired position, and the process continues until all children have been popped from the list.

It then uses a while loop to generate the permutations. The kids list is used to keep track of the children's ages. The pop method is used to remove the child from the list and add them to the result list. The index i is calculated by dividing k by the factorial of n-1. If k is even, the index is used directly, otherwise, it is decremented by 1. The k is then updated by taking the modulus of k and f.

The function `permute` takes two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is the number of noble children and `k` is the desired arrangement's position. The function returns the exact sequence of the parade order or an empty list if the request is beyond the realm's combinatorial bounty.\n\nThe function first checks if `k` is greater than the factorial of `n`. If it is, the function returns an empty list because there are fewer than `k` valid arrangements.\n\nThe function then creates a list `kids` of noble children's ages from 1 to `n`. The function also creates an empty list `result` to store the parade order.\n\nThe function enters a loop where it continues until all the noble children have been added to `result`. In each iteration of the loop, the function calculates the factorial of `n-1` and divides `k` by this factorial to get the index `i` of the child to be added to `result`. The remainder of `k` divided by the factorial is stored in `k`.\n\nThe child at index `i` (or `i-1` if `k` is 0) is removed from `kids` and added to `result`. The value of `n` is decremented by 1.\n\nFinally, the function returns `result`.\n",

It then returns the kth permutation. The permutations are generated in reverse order, so that the last element of the permutation is the largest number. The index of the number to be removed from the list is calculated by dividing k by the factorial of the number of remaining numbers. The factorial is used to calculate the number of permutations of the remaining numbers. The kth permutation is then removed from the list and added to the permutations list. This process is repeated until all numbers have been removed from the list. If k is greater than the number of permutations, an empty list is returned.\n",

The function permute takes two parameters: n and k. n is the number of children and k is the desired arrangement position. The function returns a list of children's ages in the order they should march if the conditions are met, otherwise it returns an empty list.\n\nThe function works by popping elements from the kids list and appending them to the result list.

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Lexiconia, there lived a guild of storytellers known as the Articulators. Their craft revolved around assembling tales\u2014each tale was a string of words, cherished for its unique combination of letters. Every Articulator contributed a particular tale, and these were logged in the grand Chronicle, a ledger listing each member\u2019s story in order. One day, the Guildmaster devised a challenge: to test unity among the stories, she wished to know, for every storyteller, the greatest harmony their peers could achieve if that storyteller stepped aside for a moment.\n\nThe Guildmaster\u2019s rules were strict. For each participant, when their tale was temporarily removed from consideration, the remaining members would form a circle. From among these, the Guildmaster could call upon a council of exactly K Articulators\u2014where K was a sacred number set at the dawn of the challenge and never changed from test to test. These K would compare the beginnings of their tales, letter by letter, to see how many opening letters they all shared in common. The longest streak of shared letters determined the measure of their harmony. However, if, upon removing a member, fewer than K Articulators remained, the Guildmaster would record a harmony score of zero for that storyteller, as true unity required a full council.\n\nThe challenge was as follows: for every position in the Chronicle, determine the greatest harmony\u2014the length of the longest shared prefix\u2014that any council of K storytellers could find among themselves after the tale at that position is set aside. Each harmony score was to be written down, in order, as the answer\u2014a ledger of unity for each original tale.\n\nThe Guildmaster announced how the challenge would unfold: each test would begin with a scroll listing N tales, one for each storyteller, and the sacred number K. The tales would be presented in a line, just as they appeared in the Chronicle. For each tale, the Guild would seek the greatest unity (the longest shared prefix for any group of K among the remaining tales) and record it accordingly. Should there ever be too few tales left, the unity for that position would be marked as zero. At the end, the Guild would provide a list of N numbers\u2014one for each storyteller\u2019s absence\u2014reflecting these highest measures of harmony. The format was precise: first, the number N and the sacred K, followed by the list of tales, and finally, the list of unity scores, in order, as the Chronicle decreed.\n\nTo illuminate her challenge, the Guildmaster offered examples:  \n*If the tales were [\"jump\", \"run\", \"run\", \"jump\", \"run\"] and the sacred council numbered two, then upon removing each tale in turn, the unity scores would be [3, 4, 4, 3, 4]. For instance, if \"jump\" at the first position was dismissed, the longest common beginning among any two remaining tales was the three letters \"run.\" When a \"run\" was put aside, two \"jump\" tales could unite with a shared four-letter opening, and so forth.*\n\nIn another trial, if the tales were [\"dog\", \"racer\", \"car\"] and the council size was two, removing any single tale left no two tales with a shared beginning, so each storyteller\u2019s unity score was zero.  \n\nThus, the Articulators\u2019 challenge was set\u2014a test of collective resonance, each member\u2019s absence revealing the greatest harmony their peers could conjure, all within the strict confines of the Chronicle\u2019s ever-watchful eye.",

It starts with the first word, then finds the common prefixes of that word and all subsequent words. It continues this process until it finds a common prefix that is at least length `k`. It then returns a list of the length of the longest common prefix for each word. If no common prefixes of length `k` or more are found, it returns a list of zeros of the same length as the input list.\n",

Then, for each position in the list, it calculates the common prefix with the previous k-1 words. The common prefix with the previous k-1 words is calculated by getting the common prefix of the current prefix and the word k positions ago. The result is the length of this common prefix.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of words and m is the average length of the words. The space complexity is also O(n*m), where n is the number of words and m is the average length of the words.\n",

Then, a helper function `get_unity` is defined that takes a list of words and a number `k`, and returns the unity score of the `k` words in the list. The unity score is calculated by finding the longest common prefix of the `k` words in the list. If there is no common prefix, the unity score is 0.\n\nThe main function `longestCommonPrefix` takes a list of words and a number `k`, and returns a list of unity scores for each word in the list. For each word, all other words are removed from the list, and the unity score is calculated. The unity scores are then returned as a list.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 * m), where n is the number of words and m is the length of the longest word. This is because for each word, we are removing it from the list and calculating the unity score, which takes O(n * m) time. The space complexity is O(n), as we are storing the unity scores in a list.\n"

        "question_content": "In the ancient realm of Numeria, the great Library of Arrays preserved the sacred Scroll of Patterns. Each year, the Librarians were given a sequence of numbers\u2014known as the Origin Sequence\u2014of length N. Alongside this, they received a set of enchanted scrolls, each bearing a pair of boundaries for every position in the sequence. The ith scroll whispered the lowest and highest numbers (let us call them the lower and upper bounds) that the new Chronicle Sequence could hold at its ith place.\n\nThe law of Numeria, however, was strict. For a Chronicle Sequence to be accepted by the Library, it had to echo the spirit of the Origin: the difference between any two consecutive numbers in the Chronicle must be exactly what it was in the Origin. In other words, the pattern of steps from one number to the next had to march in perfect rhythm with the ancient sequence. At the same time, every number in the Chronicle had to obey the enchanted bounds set by the scrolls\u2014neither dipping below the lower bound nor rising above the upper one for its position.\n\nYour challenge, as one of Numeria's apprentice Scribes, is to determine how many distinct Chronicle Sequences could be inscribed, each of length N, that meet both these requirements. In other words, count all possible Chronicle Sequences that follow the difference pattern of the Origin, and yet, at every position, remain within the respective lower and upper bounds. Your solution must be efficient, for the Library sometimes asks for very long sequences\u2014N may be as grand as one hundred thousand, and each number in the sequences and bounds can rise as high as a billion.\n\nThe Scribes record their findings with precision. Each test you encounter will provide you with the Origin Sequence (a list of N numbers), and an array of N boundary pairs (each pair giving the lower and upper bounds for that position). After careful deliberation, you must return a single number: the count of all Chronicle Sequences that could exist. The Library expects you to adhere to this format\u2014your answer should be a single number on a parchment line. For each test, the format is as follows:\n- The first line presents the Origin Sequence, as a list of N numbers.\n- The second line contains N pairs of numbers, each pair giving the lower and upper bounds for each position.\n- Your answer must be a single integer: the number of valid Chronicle Sequences.\n\nConsider these tales from past Scribes:\n- In one test, the Origin Sequence was [1, 2, 3, 4], and the bounds were [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]. There were two Chronicle Sequences that honored both the pattern and the bounds: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [2, 3, 4, 5].\n- In another, with Origin [1, 2, 3, 4] and bounds [[1, 10], [2, 9], [3, 8], [4, 7]], the Scribes found four acceptable Chronicles: [1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5, 6], and [4, 5, 6, 7].\n- But sometimes, the scrolls are too strict: with Origin [1, 2, 1, 2] and bounds [[1, 1], [2, 3], [3, 3], [2, 3]], the Scribes realized no Chronicle could satisfy both the pattern and all the bounds\u2014there were none.\n\nThus the Scribes of Numeria continue their work, ever seeking the Chronicle Sequences that perfectly match the ancient patterns, yet never stray beyond their assigned limits.",

        "question_content": "In the distant land of Abecedia, there lived a guild of scribes renowned for their mastery over the Scroll of Letters, a magical parchment inscribed with a line of symbols\u2014each one an ancient rune from the Circle of Twenty-Six. The scribes had discovered a curious enchantment: by expending a precious token of effort, they could nudge any symbol on the scroll one step forward or backward along the Circle\u2014so that after 'a' comes 'b', after 'z' comes 'a', and so forth, looping endlessly. Each transformation, whether forward or backward, cost a single token, and each scribe was granted a limited number of these tokens per task.\n\nThe Grand Council of Scribes, eager to test the wisdom of apprentices, devised a challenge. Given a sacred sequence of runes and a fixed purse of transformation tokens, the apprentice was to reshape the scroll\u2014using no more than the permitted number of tokens\u2014so that the resulting sequence would contain the longest possible thread of mirrored symbols, a mystical palindrome, read the same from dawn to dusk and dusk to dawn. The catch: the mirrored sequence did not need to use every symbol, but its length should be as great as possible, and the apprentice could pick any positions on the scroll to form this thread, skipping some runes if desired.\n\nTo enter the contest, an apprentice would present a scroll, known as the input parchment, bearing a sequence of N runes (where N could be anything from a single rune up to two hundred), and declare their token purse, M (no less than one and no more than two hundred tokens). Each rune was a lowercase letter of the ancient tongue, forming the original sequence.\n\nThe output, which the Council demanded, was a single integer: the greatest possible length of a mirrored thread\u2014the longest palindromic subsequence\u2014that the apprentice could conjure after making careful use of their allotted tokens, and no more.\n\nLet us see how this unfolded in practice. For instance, when presented with the scroll \"abced\" and two tokens, an adept apprentice might expend a token to nudge the second rune from 'b' to 'c', and the fifth rune from 'd' to 'c', shaping the sequence into \"accec\". Now, the thread \"ccc\" (using the third, fourth, and fifth runes) gleams from both ends, a palindrome of length three, the greatest possible under these circumstances.\n\nIn another challenge, the scroll \"aaazzz\" and four tokens were provided. With clever transformations\u2014turning the first rune backward to 'z', the fifth forward to 'a', adjusting the runes further within their allowance\u2014the apprentice could ultimately shape the entire sequence into \"zaaaaz\" or \"zaazaz\", each a perfect palindrome spanning the full length of six runes.\n\nThus, the Council\u2019s challenge was clear: Given a scroll (the string of runes) and a purse of transformation tokens (the integer), discover and report the length of the longest palindromic thread that could be woven by strategic nudges\u2014each nudge costing a single token, all within the apprentice's allowance. The input parchment would present the sequence and the token count, and the apprentice must return a single integer, the length of their greatest mirrored achievement.",

The dp array is a 2D array where the first dimension is the starting index of the substring and the second dimension is the ASCII value of the character. The value at dp[i][j] is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence that starts at index i and ends with character j.\n\nThe solution iterates over the string in reverse order, updating the dp array for each character. For each character, it updates the dp value for the character itself and for all characters that come after it in the string. It also updates the dp value for all characters to be the maximum of the current dp value and the dp value for the next character plus one.\n\nFinally, the solution returns the minimum of the length of the longest palindromic subsequence and the number of transformation tokens.\n"

The number of stones, which can be any whole amount from a single stone up to the value known as N (where N shall never exceed one hundred), and the magical power embedded in each stone\u2014sometimes positive, sometimes negative, but always an integer between negative one hundred and one hundred\u2014are revealed at dawn.\n\nThe lore of Numeria is strict: before claiming the Crown, aspirants may cast away as many stones as they wish from the path, provided they leave at least one stone behind. Once satisfied with their culling, they must select a continuous stretch of stones\u2014never skipping or jumping\u2014forming a precious chain. The Crown, however, recognizes only such chains where every stone\u2019s magical signature is unique, for the artifact loathes repetition and punishes greed.\n\nThe challenge is simple in intent but rich in possibility: each seeker must, through judicious removal and careful selection, uncover a chain whose sum of magical signatures is as immense as possible. The Crown responds only to the grandest sum that can be achieved under these rules, dismissing lesser attempts.\n\nThe chroniclers of Numeria record each quest in an ancient script: the first line inscribes a single number, the count of stones present (N). The second line lists N numbers\u2014the magical signatures of the stones, one after another. Upon solving the challenge, the seeker inscribes a single number on the next line, marking the greatest sum possible from a valid, repetition-free chain. Thus, every tale follows this structure:\n\n**Input Format:**  \nA single line with the number of stones (N).  \nA single line with N integers, representing the magical signatures of the stones.\n\n**Output Format:**  \nA single line with one integer\u2014the grandest sum achievable from a chain of unique stones after any number of removals.\n\nLet us recount three such legendary quests:  \n*In the time of Idris, the stones read \u201c1 2 3 4 5.\u201d Idris, perceiving no duplicity among the stones and recognizing the pathway\u2019s sum as the mightiest possible (15), left all stones undisturbed and claimed the Crown with their full sum.*  \n*In the era of Lira, the path was cluttered with \u201c1 1 0 1 1.\u201d Lira, understanding the burden of repetition, discarded all but a lone stone, thus earning a sum of 1 as her prize.*  \n*Finally, Velan faced the path \u201c1 2 -1 -2 1 0 -1.\u201d By banishing certain stones and selecting the chain \u201c2 1,\u201d Velan secured a sum of 3, the best Numeria could offer that day.*\n\nThus, the seekers of Numeria learn: the path to the Crown of Sums lies not in brute force, but in the artful balance of elimination and selection, ever in pursuit of the most powerful, unique chain.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient kingdom of Numeria, there existed a mystical scroll called the Sequence of Harmony. This scroll listed N unique enchanted runes in perfect order, from the smallest to the largest. But not all was well\u2014some runes harbored ancient feuds, forbidden ever to be displayed together within the same magical window, or \u201csubsequence.\u201d The Royal Archivists carefully recorded all such feuding pairs in a great ledger, with each entry inscribed as two numbers, denoting the quarrelsome runes.\n\nThe custodians of Numeria\u2019s magic faced a perennial challenge: they wished to display as many harmonious magical windows as possible, each window being a contiguous run of runes from the scroll, but none could feature both members of any feuding pair. Only by removing, with great ceremony, a single feud from the ledger could they hope to maximize the count of harmonious windows\u2014windows in which no forbidden pair appeared together. The rules of Numeria were strict: the number of runes, N, could be anything from two to a hundred thousand, and the number of feuding pairs in the ledger could range from just one to twice the number of runes.\n\nIt was the duty of the Royal Mathemagician to determine, for any given scroll and its ledger of feuds, which single feud should be erased to allow the greatest number of harmonious windows. Upon making this choice, the Mathemagician would calculate the count of all possible non-empty magical windows (\u201csubarrays,\u201d in the ancient tongue) such that no window contained both members of any remaining feud. The goal: find the utmost possible total of these harmonious windows after exactly one feud had been erased.\n\nShould you wish to pose this challenge to the Mathemagician, you must present two things: the number of runes, followed by a list of all feuding pairs. The list of pairs is given as a series of duos, each representing two runes who cannot abide one another. In return, the Mathemagician will reveal a single number: the largest count of harmonious windows achievable after removing one feud from the ledger.\n\nConsider, for example, a scroll with four runes and the following feuds: the second rune and the third, the first and the fourth. If the feud between the second and third is erased, only the feud between the first and fourth remains. In this case, there are nine magical windows free of forbidden pairs\u2014those that never contain both the first and fourth runes. Thus, the Mathemagician would answer \u20189.\u2019\n\nIn another case, with five runes and three feuds\u2014between the first and second, second and fifth, and third and fifth\u2014erasing the feud between the first and second allows for twelve harmonious windows. The Mathemagician returns \u201812\u2019 as the answer for this scroll and ledger.\n\nAnd so, the challenge is set: **Given the count of runes and the list of feuding pairs, decide which single feud to erase to maximize the number of magical windows that abide by all remaining feuds, and reveal this greatest possible total.**",

For each pair of conflicting runes, the conflict count for both runes is incremented. Then, for each rune, the count of non-conflicting subsequences is calculated. If the rune is not conflicting with the previous rune, the count of non-conflicting subsequences for the previous rune is added to the count for the current rune. If the rune is conflicting with the previous rune, the maximum count of non-conflicting subsequences is taken. Finally, the count of non-conflicting subsequences for the last rune is returned.\n",

It iterates over all possible subsets of runes, and for each subset, it calculates the maximum number of non-conflict subarrays by adding the maximum number of non-conflict subarrays of the subset without the last rune and the last rune. If the subset contains more than one rune, it also calculates the maximum number of non-conflict subarrays by adding the maximum number of non-conflict subarrays of the subset without the last rune and the last rune if they are not conflicting.

        "question_content": "In the verdant realm of Floravale, each spring brings a unique challenge for the Gardeners\u2019 Guild: the Grand Fruit Allocation. Every year, N varieties of magical fruits ripen throughout the land, each producing a specific harvest\u2014sometimes modest, sometimes abundant. For each harvest, the guild has prepared exactly N enchanted baskets, each with its own, carefully enchanted capacity\u2014some are vast and sturdy, others delicate and dainty.\n\nTradition and ancient magical law dictate the rules of the allocation. Each fruit variety must find its home in the first available basket, moving from left to right across the garden\u2019s central row, whose spellbound markers make their order immutable. The guiding principle is simple: a fruit variety may only be placed in a basket whose capacity can cradle the entire bounty of that fruit, and once a basket has received a fruit, it will accept no others. If the harvest from a particular fruit proves too bountiful for the remaining baskets, that fruit must sit, unclaimed, at the edge of the table, fated to wither.\n\nThe objective for every gardener is to secure shelter for as many fruit varieties as possible, working from the leftmost fruit and basket toward the right, and abiding by the rituals\u2019 strict protocol. In the end, the guild\u2019s success is measured by how many fruit varieties, if any, are left forlorn without a home, despite every earnest effort.\n\nFor this year\u2019s challenge, the Gardeners\u2019 Guild distributes instructions written in the language of their realm. Instead of arcane lists and grimoires, they provide the following:  \n**Input**: The number of fruit varieties (N), followed by a list describing the size of each harvest, and a second list specifying the capacity of each enchanted basket.  \n**Output**: The number of fruit varieties that, after attempting all possible placements, remain unplaced and without a basket.\n\nLet us consider two tales from the annals of the guild. In the first, there were three fruit varieties with harvests of 4, 2, and 5, and three baskets with capacities of 3, 5, and 4, respectively. The first fruit, needing space for 4, could only fit in the second basket, whose capacity was 5. The second, needing just 2, found its place in the first basket, sized at 3. The final, the most abundant at 5, found no basket remaining with capacity enough. Thus, one fruit variety was left unplaced.\n\nIn another spring, the guild witnessed a harvest of 3, 6, and 1 for their three fruit varieties, with baskets sporting capacities of 6, 4, and 7. Here, the first fruit found sanctuary in the largest basket, the second\u2014though too plentiful for the middle basket\u2014found its place in the third, and the last fruit fit snugly in the second basket. No fruit remained unplaced, and the guild rejoiced at their perfect allocation.\n\nSo stands the challenge: in the world of Floravale, with N harvests and N baskets, each gardener seeks to minimize the number of unplaced fruits, adhering to the rituals that govern their magical, orderly world.",

The fruits and baskets are sorted in ascending order. A pointer `i` is used to traverse the fruits and a pointer `j` is used to traverse the baskets. If the fruit at index `i` can fit in the basket at index `j`, both pointers are incremented. If the fruit at index `i` cannot fit in the basket at index `j`, the unplaced counter is incremented and the pointer `j` is incremented. If all fruits have been traversed but there are still baskets left, the unplaced counter is incremented for each remaining basket. The function finally returns the unplaced counter, which represents the number of fruits that were not able to find a home.\n",

Then, it iterates over the fruits and baskets in reverse order. If a basket can hold a fruit, it moves to the next fruit and basket. If a basket cannot hold a fruit, it increments the unplaced_fruits count and moves to the next basket. If there are still fruits left after all baskets have been checked, they are unplaced, so the count is added to the unplaced_fruits count.\n",

It then iterates over the fruits and baskets simultaneously. If a fruit's size is less than or equal to the size of a basket, it means the fruit can fit in that basket and we move to the next fruit. If not, we move to the next basket. The number of fruits left unplaced is then calculated by subtracting the number of fruits we managed to fit from the total number of fruits.\n",

If a fruit can fit into a basket, both pointers are moved forward. If a fruit cannot fit into a basket, only the basket pointer is moved forward. If a fruit remains unplaced (i.e., its size is larger than all remaining baskets), it is counted as such.

            "```python\nclass Solution:\n    def numOfUnplacedFruits(self, fruits: List[int], baskets: List[int]) -> int:\n        fruits.sort()\n        baskets.sort()\n        i = j = unplaced = 0\n        while i < len(fruits) and j < len(baskets):\n            if fruits[i] <= baskets[j]:\n                i += 1\n                j += 1\n            else:\n                unplaced += 1\n                j += 1\n        return unplaced + len(fruits) - i\n```\n\nThis solution works by first sorting both the fruits and baskets lists. Then, it uses two pointers to traverse both lists. If a fruit can fit into a basket, it moves both pointers forward. If a fruit can't fit, it only moves the basket pointer forward and increments the unplaced counter. Finally, it adds the remaining fruits to the unplaced counter and returns the result.\n",

It starts by sorting both lists. The while loop continues until all fruits have been placed or all baskets have been checked. If a fruit's size is less than or equal to the size of the current basket, the fruit is placed in that basket and the fruit index is incremented. If the fruit's size is greater than the current basket's size, the basket index is incremented. After the loop, if there are still unplaced fruits (i.e., the fruit index is less than the length of the fruits list), the number of unplaced fruits is calculated by subtracting the fruit index from the length of the fruits list. The function then returns the number of unplaced fruits.\n"

        "question_content": "In the heart of the twin kingdoms of Seraphia and Tenebria, legends spoke of a magical tapestry woven from two enchanted threads. Each kingdom possessed one of these precious threads, each a delicate string of colored symbols, with Seraphia\u2019s thread stretching N segments long, and Tenebria\u2019s thread extending M segments. These threads, shimmering with runes from the ancient alphabet, held a secret: when fragments of both were skillfully joined, they could awaken a lost power\u2014the creation of a perfect reflection, a sequence identical forward and backward, known to the sages as the Palindromic Crest.\n\nThe ancient laws of the land allowed any artisan\u2014should they be daring enough\u2014to cut a segment, of any length (even none at all), from each kingdom\u2019s thread. The only rule was that these chosen fragments must remain in their original order, just as the stories and lineages of the two realms. Once selected, the segments could be joined end-to-end, first Seraphia\u2019s piece, then Tenebria\u2019s, to form a new tapestry. However, not every joining would echo with the palindromic resonance. The most esteemed artisans sought not only to weave such a reflection but to do so using as many segments as possible, achieving the grandest and longest Palindromic Crest ever seen.\n\nYour quest, as the kingdom\u2019s newest artisan, is to determine just how grand a Palindromic Crest can be woven from the threads of Seraphia and Tenebria. For each challenge, the twin kingdoms provide you with their current threads, each a string of symbols whose length abides by the decree: no less than one, and no more than thirty. Your task is to declare, for the given pair of threads, the greatest possible length of a Palindromic Crest you can create by choosing any (possibly empty) fragments from the start, middle, or end of each thread, and joining them in order\u2014Seraphia\u2019s followed by Tenebria\u2019s.\n\nThe royal scribes have established the following procedure for communication:  \n\u2014 First, inscribe one line bearing the thread of Seraphia.  \n\u2014 Next, inscribe one line bearing the thread of Tenebria.  \n\u2014 In your final reply, write only the number representing the length of the most magnificent Palindromic Crest you can assemble.\n\nLet us consider a few tales from the archives. In one, both kingdoms offer the single symbol \u201ca\u201d; combining the two forms the mirrored \u201caa\u201d, a Crest of length two. In another tale, the threads are \u201cabc\u201d and \u201cdef\u201d\u2014here, no grand symmetry can be found, and the best any artisan achieves is a crest of a single segment. When Seraphia\u2019s thread is \u201cb\u201d and Tenebria\u2019s is \u201caaaa\u201d, the wisdom is to weave only Tenebria\u2019s offering, producing the perfect \u201caaaa\u201d of length four. Most impressively, when Seraphia provides \u201cabcde\u201d and Tenebria retorts with \u201cecdba\u201d, a savvy artisan takes \u201cabc\u201d from the first and \u201cba\u201d from the second, for the illustrious \u201cabcba\u201d\u2014a Palindromic Crest of length five.\n\nSo, O artisan of the threads, ready your loom and steady your hand. For each challenge, the fate of the tapestry\u2014and the pride of both kingdoms\u2014rests with you.",

        "question_content": "In the enchanted land of Loomeria, there exists a grand laboratory where the art of potion-making is not only a science but a delicate dance of precision. Here, a circle of N wizards, each uniquely attuned to the currents of magic, labor to brew M mysterious potions. Each wizard\u2019s mastery is measured by a secret number\u2014whispered in the halls as their \u201cskill\u201d\u2014while each potion brims with its own reservoir of mana, a force as varied as the stars themselves.\n\nIn Loomeria\u2019s most ancient tradition, every potion must journey sequentially through the hands of all N wizards, one after another, with no more than the blink of an eye between transitions. Each wizard, when their turn comes, tends to the potion for a span of time calculated by multiplying their own magical skill with the potion\u2019s mana. This ritual means that for potion number j, wizard number i will devote a time equal to their skill number multiplied by the potion\u2019s mana reserve. Once a potion\u2019s turn is complete with one wizard, it passes instantly to the next, never waiting or lingering\u2014timing must be perfectly harmonious, for any delay disrupts the delicate weave of magic.\n\nBut the challenge is compounded: the M potions are to be brewed one after the other, never in parallel, and always in the order prescribed by the High Council. No wizard may touch a new potion until the previous one has fully left their care, and every potion\u2019s journey through the wizards must be perfectly synchronized. If a potion arrives at the next wizard before they have finished with their last task, it must wait. The brewing master seeks to discover: what is the shortest possible span of time in which all M potions can be brewed according to these rules?\n\nTo embark on this quest, the brewing master will receive the following guidance: The first scroll lists N numbers, one for each wizard\u2019s skill, and the second scroll displays M numbers, each revealing a potion\u2019s mana. These must be interpreted as the strengths of each wizard and potion, respectively. The master must then craft an answer\u2014one single number, the shortest time in which all potions have passed through all wizards in their assigned order, with every constraint honored and every moment efficiently spent.\n\nLet us consult the archives of Loomeria for examples:\n\n**First Chronicle:**  \nThe skills of the wizards are recorded as [1, 5, 2, 4]. The potions\u2019 mana reservoirs are [5, 1, 4, 2]. Through careful calculation, it is revealed that the final brewing completes at the 110th chime of the lab\u2019s great clock.\n\n**Second Chronicle:**  \nWith three humble wizards, each bearing a skill of 1, and three gentle potions, each holding mana of 1, the task completes on the 5th bell.\n\n**Third Chronicle:**  \nShould the wizards\u2019 skills be [1, 2, 3, 4] and the potions\u2019 mana [1, 2], the last potion\u2019s journey ends on the 21st ring.\n\nThus, in Loomeria\u2019s laboratory, to master the brewing, one must read the skills and mana from the scrolls, and, by following the ancient ritual, divine the minimal time in which magic\u2019s work may truly be complete.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling kingdom of Numaria, the Grand Council oversees a line of enchanted lanterns, each glowing with a certain intensity. The Council, a group of wise magicians, keeps a close watch on these lanterns, for the well-being of the land depends on balancing their collective light. There are exactly N lanterns, each marked in a row from the first to the N-th, their lights flickering with initial strengths as inscribed in the royal register. The kingdom is abuzz\u2014an order has come down: the lanterns must be brought to perfect darkness, their flames reduced to naught, so that a momentous eclipse festival can begin.\n\nHowever, the Council has devised a peculiar method to dim the lanterns. They will perform a sequence of magical decrees, termed as \u201cedicts.\u201d Each edict is recorded as a scroll bearing three numbers: the position of the first and last lantern to be addressed by the edict, and a power value indicating the strength of the spell to be used. For every edict, the Council may choose any subset of lanterns between those positions (inclusive), and for each lantern chosen, its light dims by the spell\u2019s power. The Council must cast these edicts in the order written, and each edict may only be used once before moving to the next.\n\nThe Grand Council\u2019s task is clear: determine the smallest number of edicts, cast in the given order starting from the first, needed to plunge all lanterns into complete darkness, with every flame precisely extinguished\u2014no more, no less. If it is impossible to achieve darkness using all available edicts, the Council must declare the effort doomed by stating so.\n\nThe royal scribe records the edicts and the lantern strengths upon scrolls received from the Council. The scrolls for the edicts list, in order, the first and last lantern (by position, starting from the first lantern) affected by each spell and the dimming power of the spell. The scribe will present:  \n- The number of lanterns, followed by their initial flames (N numbers in total).  \n- The number of edicts, followed by each edict\u2019s information: three numbers per edict\u2014the position of the first and last lantern affected, and the strength by which the spell dims chosen lanterns.  \nAfter consulting the magicians, the scribe shall write down a single number: the fewest edicts required to achieve perfect darkness, or, if impossible, the solemn symbol for failure (which the Council writes as minus one).\n\nLet us observe the Council\u2019s challenge through examples drawn from Numaria\u2019s Chronicles:\n\n**First Chronicle:** Three lanterns, shining with flames of two, zero, and two, and three edicts:  \n- The first edict can dim any lantern among the first through the third by one; after two such edicts, the lanterns reach perfect darkness. Thus, the scribe writes \u201c2.\u201d  \n**Second Chronicle:** Four lanterns ablaze, and two edicts. Even after casting both spells, the lanterns cannot all be extinguished, so the scribe solemnly pens \u201c-1.\u201d  \n**Third Chronicle:** Five lanterns, five edicts: with careful spellcasting, darkness is achieved after four edicts; thus, the ledger records \u201c4.\u201d  \n**Fourth Chronicle:** A sequence of spells, six in all\u2014darkness is achieved after the fourth, with \u201c4\u201d recorded in the great book.\n\nThus, the Grand Council\u2019s problem: determine, for any array of lanterns and sequence of edicts, the smallest number of edicts needed\u2014in strict order\u2014to bring forth the eclipse, or acknowledge defeat with a single, mournful mark.",

Each year, the council invites aspiring codebreakers to participate in the Festival of Digits, handing each contender a unique satchel filled with tokens. Each token bears a single numeral, and each is as precious as the next, for a codebreaker may use each token at most once when assembling their three-digit code.\n\nThe laws of Numeralis are clear: the code must have exactly three digits, and the first token chosen cannot display the mark of nothingness (for the vault scorns numbers that begin with zero). Furthermore, the final token placed must bear an even digit, as the vault\u2019s gears turn only for such endings. Because each token is distinct\u2014even if it shares a face with another\u2014a codebreaker can use a numeral multiple times only if their satchel contains multiple tokens displaying that numeral.\n\nOn the grand table where the council records each attempt, codebreakers must present their satchel\u2019s contents. The satchel is described by a scroll listing the count of tokens N (where N is no fewer than three and no greater than ten), followed by a row of N numerals ranging from zero to nine\u2014each representing a single token in the satchel. To succeed in the vault\u2019s challenge, the codebreaker must determine the total number of unique three-digit even numbers that can be conjured from their collection, using each token no more than once in any arrangement.\n\nThe codebreakers know that their task is not merely to find a valid code, but to count every possible distinct three-digit even number that could be unlocked with their tokens, using as many combinations as the satchel allows\u2014no more, no less. The council expects the answer to be recorded as a single number: the count of all such possible codes.\n\nFor instance, when one codebreaker receives tokens marked 1, 2, 3, and 4, they discover that there are twelve unique ways to assemble the Code of Three according to the city\u2019s laws. Another contender, holding tokens marked 0, 2, and 2, finds just two paths: one leading to 202, and the other to 220. A third challenger, with a satchel full of three tokens all marked 6, finds their fortune in the single number 666. Yet, a codebreaker clutching only 1, 3, and 5 leaves the festival empty-handed, for no even ending can be fashioned from such a set.\n\nSo, to partake in the festival, a would-be codebreaker must approach the council with their satchel. They present their scroll in the following way: first, the number N, and then, in the next line, N numerals separated by spaces. In return, the council announces a single number\u2014the count of all valid codes that can be created. Thus, the city of Numeralis celebrates not just the unlocking of the vault, but the cleverness and precision required to enumerate all the possibilities within the bounds of their ancient code.\n\n---\n\n**Festival Inputs and Outcomes:**\n\n- **Input:**  \n  4  \n  1 2 3 4  \n  **Output:**  \n  12  \n  *(Twelve codes such as 124, 132, 134, etc.)*\n\n- **Input:**  \n  3  \n  0 2 2  \n  **Output:**  \n  2  \n  *(The codes 202 and 220)*\n\n- **Input:**  \n  3  \n  6 6 6  \n  **Output:**  \n  1  \n  *(The single code 666)*\n\n- **Input:**  \n  3  \n  1 3 5  \n  **Output:**  \n  0  \n  *(No even codes possible)*",

These chosen numbers, revered as \"beautiful,\" are those whose inner workings show a special balance between the sum and the product of their individual digits.\n\nAs dictated by the Numerian Code, the Council selects a pair of gates, known as the Lower and Upper Arc, each inscribed with a positive value: the Lower Arc marks the smallest house number to consider, and the Upper Arc, the largest. All numbers living in houses between these two gates (including the gates themselves) are invited to the contest. The Council knows that the festival is grand, and thus, the Lower and Upper Arc can be set anywhere from the smallest house of all (home 1) to any abode less than one hundred million (for the Numerians measure their land by powers of ten, and their upper limit is just shy of ten multiplied by itself nine times).\n\nTo be declared \"beautiful,\" a number must undergo the Festival's sacred trial: the Council gathers the digits that compose the number, first adding them together, then multiplying them all. Only those numbers whose multiplied total is evenly divisible by their summed total\u2014leaving not a single remainder\u2014are allowed to parade as the festival\u2019s most beautiful. The Council's aim is to identify every such number between the Lower and Upper Arc and count them, as efficiently as possible, for the celebration\u2019s grand tally.\n\nWhen the day arrives, the Council receives a parchment with two numbers written upon it\u2014the values of the Lower and Upper Arc. In return, the Council must produce a single number: the count of all the beautiful numbers within the festival's range, to announce to the Numerian citizens.\n\nFor illustration, let us look at two festival records from years past. When the Lower Arc was set at ten and the Upper Arc at twenty, the Council found just two beautiful numbers inside the gates\u2014house ten and house twenty\u2014so the grand tally was two. On another occasion, when the festival stretched from house one to house fifteen, the parade was far grander: ten beautiful numbers (houses one through ten, inclusive) marched in celebration.\n\nThus, the Numerian Council\u2019s challenge is always the same: given any two numbers marking the Lower and Upper Arc within Numeria\u2019s bounds, determine the number of beautiful houses within, so that the festival may honor their harmony. The parchment the Council receives will show two numbers (the Lower and Upper Arc) on a single line, separated by a space, and in turn, the Council will respond with one number\u2014the count of beautiful numbers found.\n\nLet the festival begin, and may the beautiful numbers of Numeria shine brightly once again!",

        "question_content": "In the shifting lands of Numeria, there exists an ancient corridor known as the Path of Lights. This path is divided into N chambers, each chamber glowing brightly if its spirit is awake, and lying in darkness when dormant. For the keepers, a glowing chamber is called \u201cactive,\u201d while a darkened one is \u201cinactive.\u201d The full sequence of lights and shadows is recorded as a tapestry woven from two kinds of threads: golden for the active, and obsidian for the inactive. Each tapestry, then, is a string of length N, where N may be any value from one up to a hundred thousand.\n\nThe guardians of Numeria possess a single spell of transformation, known as the Grand Trade, to bring as much brilliance as possible to the Path of Lights. But the spell is peculiar: First, they must find a band of gold thread\u2014an uninterrupted run of glowing chambers\u2014cradled fully between stretches of darkness. They unravel this golden band, plunging those chambers into shadow. Immediately after, they seek a swath of obsidian thread\u2014an unbroken line of darkness also nestled between glowing sections\u2014and imbue this darkness with light, turning all such chambers to gold. This double act of transformation may be performed only once, and only if both such bands exist. Otherwise, the guardians must accept the current pattern.\n\nImportantly, the lore requires that the ends of the tapestry always shimmer with extra, invisible gold: the pattern must be imagined as if a gleaming chamber sits at each end, outside the corridor\u2014these, however, are for ritual purposes only and do not count toward the final tally of active chambers.\n\nYour quest is thus: Given a tapestry\u2019s current pattern, determine the greatest number of glowing chambers that can be achieved after, at most, a single use of the Grand Trade ritual. You must report this number: the brightest possible outcome for the Path of Lights. The guardians will be presented with a single number N (the length of the corridor), followed by a sequence of N symbols\u2014either a golden glyph for an active chamber or an obsidian glyph for an inactive chamber. You must reply with a single number: the maximal count of shining chambers that can result.\n\nLet us see how this plays out in the records of Numeria:\n\n1. Suppose the tapestry reads \u201c01\u201d. The corridor holds two chambers, the first dark, the second lit. Neither band of gold nor swath of obsidian lies between shadowy stretches. Thus, no Grand Trade can occur, and the Path remains with a single glowing chamber.\n\n2. When the keepers find the pattern \u201c0100\u201d, they imagine it as \u201c101001\u201d by placing extra shining chambers on either end. Now, with a single Grand Trade, they may transform the central band of darkness (\u201c100\u201d within \u201c101001\u201d) into light, yielding at most four shining chambers.\n\n3. For the tapestry \u201c1000100\u201d, the ritual augments it to \u201c110001001\u201d. Here, the keepers can weave the central darkness (\u201c000100\u201d) into brilliance, resulting in seven shining chambers\u2014a Path fully aglow.\n\n4. The pattern \u201c01010\u201d becomes \u201c1010101\u201d upon augmentation. A clever Grand Trade can turn the central darkness into light, leaving four shining chambers in the end.\n\nThus spun, the guardians of Numeria seek your wisdom: for any tapestry of N chambers, woven of golden and obsidian threads, tell them\u2014after, at most, one Grand Trade\u2014how much brighter the Path of Lights may become.",

The counters are reset to 0 when a '0' is encountered immediately after a '1' or a '1' is encountered immediately after a '0', as this indicates the start of a new band of gold or obsidian threads. The final result is the maximum number of active sections encountered, which is the maximum number of glowing chambers that can be achieved after, at most, a single use of the Grand Trade ritual.\n",

It then initializes three lists, `active`, `obsidian`, and `golden`, to keep track of the maximum number of active sections and obsidian sections so far. The solution iterates over the string, updating the number of active and obsidian sections as it goes. If the current section is '0', it increments the number of obsidian sections. If the current section is '1' and there is a previous obsidian section, it increments the number of active sections. The maximum number of active sections is updated whenever a new maximum is found. Finally, it returns the maximum number of active sections.\n",

Then, for each index in the string, if the section at that index is inactive (0), it calculates the count of active sections on both sides of it by subtracting the cumulative count of active sections up to the left index from the total count of active sections and vice versa. It then updates the maximum count of active sections if the current count of active sections on both sides is greater than the current maximum. Finally, it returns the maximum count of active sections.\n",

        "question_content": "In the distant land of Arithmere, there existed a grand guild known as the Order of Attributes. The Order was composed of a number of specialized houses, each house marked by a scroll listing a set of unique magical runes. The number of houses within the Order was a certain quantity, which we shall call N, while each scroll contained precisely M runes, each drawn from a well-guarded vault of magical symbols, their values always between one and one hundred. The wise elders of the Order often gathered to study the relationships among these houses, seeking to understand how the runes shaped the bonds within their brotherhood.\n\nThe core of their study revolved around a peculiar tradition: two houses were considered \u201ckindred\u201d if the scrolls of both contained at least K runes in common, where K represented a minimum threshold required for magical resonance. The elders would never compare a house with itself\u2014only distinct houses were eligible for this ritual. When two houses were found to be kindred, an ethereal thread would connect them, weaving an undirected network across the Order. Their challenge: to discern how many separate constellations, or connected groups, arose when all such threads were drawn among the houses.\n\nTo fulfill this quest, the elders devised a ceremonial protocol for seekers wishing to join their inquiry. A seeker would first present the count of houses, N. Then, for each house, the seeker would recite a scroll\u2014a sequence of M numbers, each representing a rune. After the scrolls were recited, the seeker announced the resonance threshold, K. This was the prescribed INPUT FORMAT:  \n- The first line contained the number N and the number M, separated by a space.  \n- The next N lines each presented M rune values for the respective house, separated by spaces.  \n- The final line contained the resonance threshold K.  \n\nOnce the input was gathered, the Order required only a single sacred number in return: the count of constellations (that is, connected groups) that emerged through all possible kindred bonds. This was the OUTPUT FORMAT:  \n- Output a single number, the number of distinct constellations formed.\n\nLet us consider the elders\u2019 tales of previous gatherings. In one, there were six houses, each with two runes: [1,2], [1,1], [3,4], [4,5], [5,6], and [7,7], with the resonance threshold set at one. Here, the elders found three distinct constellations formed, since some houses shared at least one rune, while others remained isolated due to lack of commonality.  \n\nIn another tale, there were three houses, each scroll containing three runes: [1,2,3], [2,3,4], and [4,3,5], with a threshold of two. In this case, all houses were bound into a single constellation, as the overlaps exceeded the threshold amongst every pair, weaving a grand tapestry of kinship.  \n\nBut at times, the runes offered little common ground. On one occasion, only two houses stood, each bearing the scroll [1,1], and the resonance threshold was set at two. Though their scrolls appeared identical, the elders' tradition counted only distinct runes, of which only one existed. Thus, no thread was spun between them, and each house remained a constellation unto itself, for a total of two.\n\nThrough these rituals and recountings, the Order of Attributes sought always to map the networks of kinship within their ranks\u2014endeavoring to capture the fullness of magical connectivity, as efficiently and completely as possible.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient land of Lexicara, the Order of the Reversed Script held a peculiar tradition. Every year, they convened to evaluate secret messages carved upon scrolls, each message woven from the humble letters of their 26-rune alphabet. Rather than value the letters as common folk did, the Order believed that the further a letter stood from the start of the ordinary alphabet, the more mystical its power\u2014thus, for them, the first rune \u2018a\u2019 shimmered with the might of twenty-six, while the last rune \u2018z\u2019 barely flickered with a value of one.  \n\nTo measure a message\u2019s true power, the Order would perform a ritual calculation known as the Reverse Degree. For each scroll brought before them\u2014its inscription of length N, never less than one rune and never more than a thousand\u2014they followed a sacred procedure: for every letter, they would determine its place within the reversed alphabet (with \u2018a\u2019 at twenty-six, \u2018b\u2019 at twenty-five, all the way to \u2018z\u2019 at one), and then multiply that mystical value by how deep into the scroll the letter appeared (first letter, second letter, and so on). They would sum up all these products to reveal the message\u2019s total Reverse Degree.\n\nThe task set forth to their apprentices was thus: given a single message composed only of the lowercase runes of Lexicara\u2019s alphabet, calculate the scroll\u2019s Reverse Degree as swiftly and accurately as possible. The greater the degree, the more revered the scroll; the Order demanded their apprentices attend to each letter\u2019s position both in the alphabet and in the scroll, and to sum with no omission or error.\n\nTo accept a new scroll for evaluation, a scribe would present the message\u2019s runes in a single line, like so:\n- **Input:** One string on a line, composed only of the lowercase runes a through z, with a length no less than one and no greater than one thousand.\n\nUpon careful calculation, the scribe would then announce the result, writing a single number:\n- **Output:** The total Reverse Degree of the message as determined by the ritual.\n\nConsider, as example, a scroll bearing the runes \u201cabc.\u201d The apprentices would see that \u2018a\u2019 (at the start of the scroll) holds a mystical value of twenty-six, \u2018b\u2019 (next in line) holds twenty-five, and \u2018c\u2019 (third) holds twenty-four. By multiplying their reversed values by their positions\u2014twenty-six times one, twenty-five times two, and twenty-four times three\u2014and summing the results (twenty-six plus fifty plus seventy-two), they glean the answer: one hundred forty-eight.\n\nOr perhaps a scroll reads \u201czaza.\u201d Here, the first letter \u2018z\u2019 is worth one, multiplied by its place (one times one), the second \u2018a\u2019 is worth twenty-six, multiplied by two (fifty-two), the third \u2018z\u2019 is worth one, multiplied by three (three), and the last \u2018a\u2019 is worth twenty-six, multiplied by four (one hundred four). Summing these, the Reverse Degree is found to be one hundred sixty.\n\nThus, the apprentices of Lexicara\u2019s Order, by understanding the ritual and its rules, could determine the true power of any message and record both their process and their mystical calculations for all to marvel at.",

        "question_content": "Long ago, in the bustling port city of Navarone, Captain Elara presided over the legendary cargo ship, the Silver Gull. The ship\u2019s heart was its broad, square cargo deck, meticulously marked out into a perfect grid: N rows and N columns, each square just big enough for one sturdy container. The city\u2019s merchants often marveled at how precisely the deck was arranged, with each square awaiting its cargo, promising the hope of distant trade.\n\nBut the Silver Gull had a rule woven into her very timbers: no matter how many crates the merchants brought, each one weighed the same\u2014let\u2019s call this unchanging heft W. And though the deck might tempt a greedy captain to fill every slot, the ship\u2019s architect had issued a stern edict: the combined weight of all loaded containers must never tip over the ship\u2019s maximum burden, a limit known to all as the Great Weight Threshold.\n\nElara\u2019s challenge was to load as many containers as possible\u2014filling the deck as fully as she dared\u2014while never daring to breach the Great Weight Threshold. She could place containers wherever she wished, but never more than one per square, and the sum of all weights could not surpass the ship\u2019s limit. The captain pondered: for a given deck size (N), container weight (W), and cargo limit (the Great Weight Threshold), how many containers could she safely load for her voyage?\n\nWhenever the harbour master handed her the plan for a new journey, the document would state three things: first, the size of the cargo deck\u2019s grid (N); second, the fixed weight of every container (W); and third, the Great Weight Threshold. In turn, Elara was to calculate a single number: the greatest count of containers she could place on her deck without ever exceeding the ship\u2019s burden. This answer was always expected as just that\u2014the number\u2014and nothing more.\n\nTake, for instance, the day when Elara was given a deck with two rows and two columns, with each container weighing three stones, and the Great Weight Threshold set at fifteen. She quickly saw that all four squares of the deck could be filled (since twelve stones is less than fifteen), and so her answer was four. On another day, with a larger three-by-three deck and containers each weighing five stones, but a threshold of twenty, she realized only four containers could be loaded (since five times four is twenty, and a fifth would be too much), even though the deck had space for more.\n\nSo it was that every time Elara set sail, she calculated, with care and precision, the perfect number of containers\u2014always striving to fill her deck as fully as possible, yet never risking the wrath of the sea by overloading her beloved Silver Gull.\n\n**Input Narrative:**  \nEach time a journey is planned, the harbour master presents three numbers\u2014first the number of rows and columns on the deck (N), then the weight of every container (W), and finally the Great Weight Threshold. These numbers are always written in order, separated by spaces, and each journey is described on its own line.\n\n**Output Narrative:**  \nFor each journey, Elara must return a single number: the largest number of containers she can safely load without exceeding her ship\u2019s limit.\n\n**Example Journeys:**  \n- When told the deck is 2 by 2, each container weighs 3 stones, and the threshold is 15, Elara responds: `4` (since all four spaces can be filled and the total weight is 12).  \n- When told the deck is 3 by 3, containers are 5 stones each, and the threshold is 20, her answer is `4` (since only four containers can be loaded before reaching the limit).\n\nThus, through careful calculation and respect for the ship\u2019s rules, Elara ensures her cargo is always maximized, her voyages prosperous, and the Silver Gull sails ever true.",

This is because each row and column can hold one container. The `//` operator is used for integer division, which discards the remainder and only keeps the quotient.\n\nThe method then returns this calculated number.\n",

        "question_content": "In the vibrant kingdom of Arraya, queues are sacred. Every morning, townsfolk gather in a single grand line to receive the day\u2019s blessings, their places determined by ancient, intricate customs. At the very end of this line stands a newcomer\u2014perhaps you\u2014eager to move closer to the front, where the blessings are most potent. The townsfolk are numbered from the wise Elder at the start (position zero) to yourself at the end (position N), making a total of N + 1 people. Each person in front of you, ever the shrewd bargainer, demands a unique toll to swap places, whispered by legend as the Price of Passage. This fee is written in the Book of Costs, where the sum demanded by each person is recorded in sequence as the Cost List.\n\nBut the customs of Arraya are nuanced. If you wish to move forward, you must negotiate with those ahead, paying each their specific price if you swap with them. Yet, if your journey leads you to a place behind, the tradition is different\u2014those behind are always eager to swap forward with a newcomer and do so freely, in the spirit of communal progress.\n\nYour quest is thus: for every coveted position in Arraya\u2019s line\u2014every spot from the Elder\u2019s up to the one just before your original place\u2014you must determine the smallest sum of gold coins you must pay to reach it, starting from your place at the end. For the customs dictate that only swaps with those ahead incur a fee, while swaps with those behind are gifts from their gracious hands. This calculation must be made for every position, seeking always the path of least expense, for in Arraya, wisdom lies in thrift.\n\nTo record your findings, you will create a Ledger of Minimum Payments, listing for each position in the line (excluding where you started at the end) the least coinage you must spend to stand there. The ancient scribes expect the input to be given as a line in the Book of Costs\u2014first the number of townsfolk (N), then the Price of Passage for each person in order. The output, written in the Ledger, must be N numbers, each showing the minimum coins required to stand at the matching position.\n\nLet us examine two stories from the town\u2019s chronicles:\n\nFirst, one morning the Cost List in the Book of Costs read as follows: **six townsfolk, with costs 5, 3, 4, 1, 3, 2.** The Ledger of Minimum Payments for this day was inscribed as: **5, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1.** This meant, for instance, that to reach the Elder\u2019s place, you\u2019d pay five coins\u2014her fee. To reach the next person\u2019s spot, just three coins, and so forth, always seeking the path that keeps your purse heaviest.\n\nAnother tale tells of **five townsfolk, with costs 1, 2, 4, 6, 7.** On this day, the Ledger showed a remarkable discovery: **1, 1, 1, 1, 1.** The clever traveler realized that paying the modest fee of the first in line opened the way to all other places for free, as those behind were happy to step aside.\n\nThus, with the rules and customs of Arraya clear, and the logic of minimum payments enshrined, you are ready to write your own story in the Ledger, ensuring at every step that no coin is spent without purpose, and every position is reached as wisely as possible.",

The minimum cost is the one that requires the least coins. The base case is when `i` is the last position, in which case the minimum cost is the cost at `i` itself.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of townsfolk.

        "question_content": "In the illustrious realm of Numeria, there exists a grand tradition among its mathematicians: whenever two treasures are discovered\u2014each marked by a number\u2014they must be combined in a special ceremony. These treasures are always positive and are chosen with care, never less than one in value and never greater than the sacred limit of two thousand twenty-five. The society reveres whole numbers, and so only such treasures are ever considered.\n\nAccording to the ancient customs of Numeria, when two treasures are brought together, the sum of their values is not celebrated as it stands. Instead, the sum is elevated to a higher status by enacting the Sacred Squaring\u2014a ritual in which the combined worth is multiplied by itself, symbolizing unity and exponential prosperity. This is the foundational rule of the realm: the result of this ceremony must always be the square of the sum of the two treasures.\n\nWithin Numeria\u2019s Hall of Records, every ceremony is meticulously documented. The scribes receive the values of the two treasures, always written together on a single scroll, separated by a space. Their solemn duty is to inscribe in the archives not the sum itself, but the result of the Sacred Squaring. The efficiency of the ceremony is paramount; the scribes must perform this calculation swiftly and accurately, with no unnecessary embellishments.\n\nThus, the challenge for every Numerian scribe is as follows: given the values of two treasures\u2014each a positive whole number not exceeding the revered limit\u2014determine the outcome of the Sacred Squaring and record this single number as the official chronicle entry for that ceremony.\n\nFor example, when a ceremony features treasures of value twenty and twenty-five, the scribe receives the scroll reading \u201c20 25\u201d and writes \u201c2025\u201d in the records, for the sum is forty-five and its square is two thousand twenty-five. Similarly, if the scroll reads \u201c30 25,\u201d the scribe records \u201c3025\u201d (since fifty-five squared is three thousand twenty-five). When treasures of forty-five and eleven are united, the result is \u201c3136.\u201d And for treasures at the very edge of Numeria\u2019s limits, such as two thousand twenty-five and one thousand one hundred eleven, the ceremony yields the resplendent number \u201c9834496.\u201d In this way, Numeria\u2019s traditions preserve both precision and wonder, ensuring that every combination of treasures is honored to its fullest potential.",

        "question_content": "In the heart of the ancient City of Multiplica, there stands a grand Hall of Tables\u2014a marvel famed for its enormous mosaic floor. This floor is arranged as a perfect square, nine tiles wide and nine tiles deep, with each tile inscribed by the artisans with a number: the product of its row and column numbers. The rows and columns are both numbered from one to nine, so every tile in the hall displays the result of multiplying its row\u2019s number by its column\u2019s number. Visitors marvel at the intricate repetition and the patterns that form across the 81 tiles.\n\nThe city\u2019s scholars uphold certain traditions regarding the Hall. They insist that each tile\u2019s value be honored as many times as it appears; if a number is repeated among the tiles, each instance must be counted individually in any tally. There is, however, a unique custom: on certain festival days, the city\u2019s leader announces a forbidden number\u2014a specific value between one and eighty-one, inclusive. On that day, all calculations and ceremonies in the Hall must ignore the forbidden number wherever it appears, treating those tiles as if they bear no value at all. If the forbidden number does not appear on any tile, the scholars proceed unimpeded, summing every value in the Hall.\n\nOn such a day, the challenge is set forth to the city\u2019s mathematicians: \u201cGiven the forbidden number, determine the grand sum of all the values on the Hall\u2019s mosaic, save for those tiles where the forbidden number appears. Each tile is counted in the sum according to its own value, and repetitions are respected. If the forbidden number is absent, the entire mosaic\u2019s sum is to be reported. If the forbidden number is present, its contribution is omitted from every tile where it appears.\u201d\n\nFor this ritual, participants are given a single scroll naming the day\u2019s forbidden number. Their task is to announce, with clarity and precision, the sum of all values on the Hall\u2019s tiles except those where the forbidden number is found. The scroll is presented in this manner: a solitary integer, inscribed upon it, between one and eighty-one. After careful calculation, the mathematician proclaims a single number\u2014the sum as decreed by the festival\u2019s rules.\n\nLet us recount three festival days as recorded in the city\u2019s annals:  \nOn the day when the forbidden number was one, only the tile at the very first row and first column bore this value. The mathematicians summed every other value, arriving at the total of two thousand and twenty-four.  \nOn another day, when eleven was declared forbidden, not a single tile bore this number in the mosaic. Therefore, the sum of all the tiles, two thousand and twenty-five, was announced.  \nOn a third occasion, when twenty-four was forbidden, the scholars found all tiles showing this value and omitted their contributions, yielding a final sum of one thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine.\n\nThus, the customs of Multiplica endure, and the Hall\u2019s mosaic continues to challenge and inspire each new generation of thinkers.",

        "question_content": "In the grand archives of Numeria, a land where numbers are living citizens, there exists a curious sect known as the Snakes. The Snakes are not just any numbers; they are distinguished by a unique tradition: each must be at least ten years old, and among the digits that make up their names, the eldest\u2014the one who stands at the front\u2014must be strictly more influential than all who follow. In other words, the first digit in a Snake\u2019s name must outshine every other digit that trails after it, holding the highest and most unchallenged authority.\n\nThis law is absolute in Numeria. For a number to be recognized as a Snake, it must obey these societal rules: its age must not fall below ten, ensuring only mature numbers are eligible. Moreover, the lead digit, the matriarch or patriarch of the number, must possess a value greater than that of any sibling digit to its right. If even a single digit equals or surpasses the front-runner, the number is disqualified from the Snake society. Thus, numbers like thirty-one and two hundred one are honored as Snakes, while thirty-five and two hundred two are not, for their leaders are not unrivaled.\n\nOne day, the Council of Numeria issued a decree: they sought to know exactly how many Snakes resided within a specified range of ages. The council\u2019s clerks were given two scrolls, each inscribed with a great number\u2014one marking the youngest age to consider, and the other the oldest. It was their duty to count, with utmost precision, every Snake whose age fell within this inclusive interval. The council\u2019s aim was not merely to find any Snake, but to enumerate every possible Snake living between these two ages, making sure none were overlooked or counted twice.\n\nTo participate in this census, a scribe would receive two numbers\u2014let\u2019s call them the lower and upper bounds\u2014written plainly in a single line, separated by a space. These numbers would always be integers, never less than ten, and never would the lower bound exceed the upper. The scribe\u2019s task was to write down, on a single line, the total number of Snakes whose names (in the decimal tongue) fell within this range, following Numeria\u2019s strict traditions.\n\nFor example, when the council asked for the count of Snakes between ninety-seven and two hundred ten, the answer was found to be six. These were the noble ninety-seven, ninety-eight, one hundred, two hundred, two hundred one, and two hundred ten\u2014all meeting the strict Snake criteria. In another inquiry, the council sought the number of Snakes between one thousand and nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine, and the tally reached two thousand twenty-five. In a grander census, spanning from two hundred fifty-two quadrillion five hundred nine trillion fifty-four billion four hundred thirty-three million nine hundred thirty-three thousand five hundred nineteen up to seven hundred sixty quadrillion seven hundred thirteen trillion sixteen billion four hundred seventy-six million one hundred ninety thousand six hundred ninety-two, the scribes reported an astonishing two hundred twenty-one trillion eight hundred fifty-two billion fifty-two million eight hundred thirty-four thousand seven hundred fifty-seven Snakes.\n\nThus, in Numeria, the search for the Snakes is never-ending, with each census a testament to the order and mystery that governs the realm of numbers.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling realm of Numeria, there exists a council of N wise elders, each identified by a unique number from the first to the N-th. Every elder is assigned a favorite number, chosen from among their peers, and this favorite is recorded in a grand ledger as a sequence: the first elder\u2019s favorite, the second\u2019s, and so forth, until all N elders are accounted for. The council has a tradition: each year, they must assign to every elder a ceremonial rank\u2014a number from the lowest, which is one, up to the most esteemed, which is M. However, the council\u2019s code of honor dictates that no elder may claim a rank higher than their chosen favorite; in other words, every elder must humbly accept a rank that is less than or equal to the rank of the peer they most admire.\n\nThe rules of Numeria are precise and unwavering. The council never exceeds N members, nor do the ranks go beyond the highest honor of M. Each elder\u2019s favorite must be, without exception, a member of the council, and all ledgers and ceremonial ranks are inscribed as whole numbers only. The code of honor applies to every single elder, and no exceptions are permitted\u2014every assignment of ranks for the year must strictly uphold this principle for all members at once.\n\nThis year, the Grand Oracle poses a challenge: \u201cHow many different ways can the ceremonial ranks be distributed among the N elders, so that every elder\u2019s rank is at most equal to that of their favorite? For each possible assignment, the elders\u2019 ranks must be chosen from the full range of honors, from one to M, and the council seeks not just one or a few, but to count every possible harmonious arrangement. However, as the numbers can grow vast, the final tally must be reported as the remainder after dividing by 998244353\u2014a tradition that keeps the recordkeepers sane.\u201d\n\nTo aid the council, the Oracle requests that the process begin with a proclamation of the council\u2019s size (N), the highest rank available (M), and the full ledger listing each elder\u2019s favorite. These are to be announced in a single line: first the two numbers for N and M, followed by the N entries of the ledger, each separated by a space. When the council\u2019s scribes have calculated the total number of valid ceremonial rank assignments, they are to announce just this single number\u2014the count modulo 998244353.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a gathering of three elders with ranks up to three, and a ledger reading \u201c2 1 1.\u201d Here, six harmonious assignments are possible: (1,1,1), (2,2,1), (2,2,2), (3,3,1), (3,3,2), and (3,3,3). If four elders all favor the first elder, and ranks can reach nine, there are 2025 possible arrangements. In a more complex case, with ten elders, ranks up to five, and a ledger of \u201c9 4 5 5 4 2 1 5 7 2,\u201d the council finds there are 10010 valid ways. And so, through careful adherence to their code and meticulous calculation, the council ensures that every year\u2019s ceremony is both fair and fully accounted for.",

        "question_content": "In the land of Lexiconia, every young scribe is introduced to the ancient tradition of Crestcrafting. In this rite, each scribe is presented with a personal token, known as the Signature Scroll. This scroll always bears a sequence of letters: the very first mark is a grand, ornate capital letter signifying the scribe\u2019s lineage, while all following marks are delicate lowercase letters, reflecting their given name. The scroll may be as short as a single character or stretch up to a hundred, but the format is always revered and never altered.\n\nThe Council of Crestmasters, who oversee all matters of tradition, have set forth precise rules for the crafting of a Crest. Firstly, only those scrolls are accepted whose first letter is bold and uppercase, a mark of noble intent. Any characters that follow must be written in humble lowercase, signifying respect for the order. Each scroll\u2019s length must be at least one and no more than a hundred symbols, ensuring every name is neither too brief nor excessively long.\n\nEach year, the Festival of Union is held, where scribes must present a new crest. The task is simple yet symbolic: from the Signature Scroll, a scribe must take the very first, grand letter\u2014no matter what follows\u2014and unite it with the sacred triad of letters: U, P, and C, always in this exact order. This union forms the Crest, a badge of honor used throughout the festival.\n\nTo participate, a scribe visits the Hall of Inscriptions, where they must present their Signature Scroll. The scroll is whispered to the Council, and, following the tradition, the Crest is forged by taking only the first symbol of the scroll and fusing it with the revered sequence of U, P, and C. The newly formed Crest is then loudly proclaimed before the assembly.\n\nFor example, when a scribe named Kyoto steps forward, her scroll bears the marks: K, y, o, t, o. The Council takes only the first, the noble K, and binds it with U, P, and C, forming the Crest: KUPC. When another scribe, Tohoku, presents his scroll, the process repeats: the T is selected, joined with U, P, and C, yielding TUPC. Thus, each scribe\u2019s unique heritage is forever linked with the legacy of the festival, and the story of their Crest is woven into the annals of Lexiconia.",

        "question_title": "Heavy Snake",
        "question_content": "In the kingdom of Serpentia, a council of N distinguished snakes resides, each renowned for their unique proportions. Every serpent in this council is defined by two attributes: the first is their remarkable girth, measured by the elders in ancient serpent units; the second is their length, which varies from snake to snake. The weight of each snake is not merely a matter of pride, but a tangible value, determined by multiplying their girth by their length\u2014a rule as old as Serpentia itself.\n\nEvery so often, a festival is declared in Serpentia, lasting for D days. During this festival, a peculiar magic takes hold: with each passing day, the length of every snake grows by exactly one unit. The girth, steadfast and unchanging, remains as it always was. This magical growth is celebrated, for it is believed that a snake\u2019s true strength\u2014its weight\u2014can only be measured when it is at its fullest stretch. Each day, the council seeks to honor the snake whose weight, after the magical growth, surpasses all others.\n\nThe festival\u2019s traditions are precise. On the first day, the lengths of all snakes are increased by one, and the proudest weight among them is recorded. On the second day, the lengths are increased by two, and again the heaviest is honored. This continues, day by day, until the Dth day, with each day\u2019s magical increase matching the day\u2019s number. The council\u2019s scribes are tasked with noting, for each day, the greatest weight achieved by any snake after their magical extension.\n\nTo ensure fairness and tradition, the council sets the following guidelines: the number of snakes and the number of festival days are both no fewer than one and no greater than one hundred. Every snake\u2019s girth and initial length are also both at least one and at most one hundred, and all measurements are always whole numbers. The scribes receive a scroll at the start: the first line lists the number of snakes and the number of festival days. Each of the next N lines describes a snake\u2019s girth and original length. Each day, the scribes must inscribe a single number\u2014the greatest weight seen that day\u2014producing D numbers in total, one per line.\n\nFor example, when the council receives a scroll reading:  \n4 3  \n3 3  \n5 1  \n2 4  \n1 10  \non the first day, after each serpent\u2019s length has grown by one, their weights are 12, 10, 10, and 11; the heaviest is 12. On the second day, the weights are 15, 15, 12, and 12; the greatest is 15. On the third day, the weights rise to 18, 20, 14, and 13; the mightiest is 20. The scribes record:  \n12  \n15  \n20\n\nIn another instance, if there is but one serpent of great girth and length, say a girth and length both of one hundred, and the festival lasts four days, the weights would be 10100, 10200, 10300, and 10400 for each day, respectively. The scribes would thus inscribe:  \n10100  \n10200  \n10300  \n10400\n\nThus, through these traditions, Serpentia preserves not only the pride of its serpents but the logic and order that govern their world.",

        "question_title": "Various Kagamimochi",
        "question_content": "In the tranquil valley of Mochi-no-Sato, there exists a long-standing tradition among the mochi artisans. Each year, the artisans gather and lay out their entire collection of rice cakes, all lined up in order from the daintiest to the most formidable. The number of rice cakes displayed, which the villagers call the mochi count, is represented by the symbol N. Each rice cake, crafted with care, has a specific size, and the sizes are listed in a scroll for all to see, ensuring that none is overlooked or duplicated in the count.\n\nAmong the mochi, there is a sacred custom for creating the revered kagamimochi\u2014a harmonious pairing of two rice cakes, one stacked atop the other. The elders dictate a vital rule: for any two mochi chosen, the smaller one may only be placed atop the larger if its size does not exceed half the size of the base. This principle, rooted in the ancient belief of balance and stability, ensures that the kagamimochi stands tall and proud throughout the festival. It is important to note that each pairing is unique not only in the sizes involved but also in the identity of each mochi; if two kagamimochi are made with the same sizes but from different rice cakes, they are considered distinct creations in the eyes of the villagers.\n\nAs the festival approaches, the artisans are given a challenge: to explore all possible pairs of mochi from their collection and determine in how many different ways they can create kagamimochi following the sacred rule. Each artisan must select two distinct rice cakes from the N available, inspect their sizes, and, if the tradition allows, fashion them into a kagamimochi. The community prizes efficiency, so the goal is to count all possible kagamimochi that can be made without missing a single valid pairing.\n\nFor the festival\u2019s record keepers, the process of submitting their findings is formalized. Each participant receives a parchment, on which the first line contains the mochi count, N. The second line is inscribed with the sizes of each rice cake, listed in ascending order and separated by spaces. The artisans must then announce, as their output, a single number: the total count of unique kagamimochi creations possible under the traditional rule.\n\nLet us witness a few chronicles from the valley\u2019s archives:\n\n**In one gathering,** there were six rice cakes, with sizes 2, 3, 4, 4, 7, and 10. After careful examination, the artisans discovered eight unique kagamimochi could be fashioned, sometimes using different rice cakes of the same size to create distinct pairings.  \n**In another instance,** only three rice cakes graced the table, sized 387, 388, and 389. Here, the elders observed that no kagamimochi could be made, for none of the smaller rice cakes met the sacred stability rule when paired with a larger one.  \n**In the grandest festival,** with thirty-two rice cakes ranging from the tiniest at size 1 to the largest at size 641, a staggering 388 unique kagamimochi were crafted, each following the valley\u2019s cherished principles.\n\nThus, the valley of Mochi-no-Sato continues its tradition, ever seeking the most creative and complete ways to honor the kagamimochi, guided by rules as enduring as the rice cakes themselves.",

The count is printed to stdout. The program uses a nested loop to iterate over all pairs of rice cakes and checks if the size of the second rice cake is at most twice the size of the first one. If it is, the pair can be made into a kagamimochi and the count is incremented. If the size of the second rice cake is larger than twice the size of the first one, the loop is broken because no more pairs can be made. The program uses a binary search to find the index of the first rice cake that is larger than twice the size of the current rice cake, which improves the efficiency of the program.\n",

        "question_content": "On the distant world of Lithora, a society of N young aliens grows under a unique tradition. Each youth begins life with a personal collection of stones, the number varying for each individual\u2014these stones are precious, representing both fortune and friendship. Time flows predictably on Lithora: every year, precisely one alien, based on their order in the community, crosses the threshold into adulthood. The first becomes an adult after one year, the second after two, and so forth, until all N have come of age.\n\nLithora\u2019s most cherished custom is the Rite of Stones. When a young alien matures, every adult who has at least one stone must offer a single stone as a congratulatory gift to the newcomer. However, those without stones are exempt from this obligation. The stones are never shared in advance or in excess\u2014each eligible adult gives only one stone per ceremony, and only on the exact year another becomes an adult. No new aliens will join the community, and the process continues until all have matured.\n\nAt the dawn of this tale, the council records the number of stones each minor holds. The council notes that the total number of aliens is represented by the symbol N, and the initial stones for each are listed in order, one for each alien: the first, the second, and so on, through to the N-th. Each of these initial numbers lies between zero and five times ten to the fifth. The society never exceeds this scale, nor do the stone collections ever fall below zero.\n\nThe council\u2019s challenge is to predict the final destiny of each alien\u2019s stone collection after all have become adults. They must account for every transaction: stones lost as gifts by early adults, and stones gained by those who come of age later. The aim is to determine, for each alien in order, how many stones remain in their possession once the last has matured, ensuring the accounting is as complete and accurate as possible.\n\nWhen presenting the data, the council reads the number of aliens, followed by the initial stone counts for each alien in order. When the prediction is made, the final stone counts for every alien are to be listed, again in order, separated by spaces. For example, if the input reads:\n```\n4\n5 0 9 3\n```\nthen, after all rites are complete, the council should declare:\n```\n2 0 10 5\n```\nFor another gathering, if the input is:\n```\n5\n4 6 7 2 5\n```\nthen the final report must be:\n```\n0 4 7 4 9\n```\nAnd for a grander assembly, the numbers:\n```\n10\n2 9 1 2 0 4 6 7 1 5\n```\nlead to the closing tally:\n```\n0 2 0 0 0 4 7 10 4 10\n```\nThus, the council\u2019s wisdom ensures every stone\u2019s journey is honored, every gift is traced, and the legacy of the Rite of Stones continues, as precise as it is profound.",

        "question_content": "In the land of Tsukimi, there exists an ancient festival where villagers gather N magical mochi, each one crafted with care and arranged in a gentle line, smallest to largest. Every mochi has a unique size, and the villagers know the exact measure of each one, though they always sort them from the tiniest to the grandest. The festival\u2019s highlight is the creation of kagamimochi\u2014sacred rice cake towers, made by stacking one mochi atop another, in a ritual that brings good fortune for the coming year.\n\nThe village elders have established a time-honored tradition for stacking: a smaller mochi may only be placed atop a larger one if the small mochi\u2019s size does not exceed half the size of the larger one. This rule is strict and admits no exception, for only then will the kagamimochi remain stable and auspicious. Furthermore, each mochi can belong to only one kagamimochi at a time\u2014no sharing or splitting of rice cakes is permitted. The villagers wish to honor the festival by forming as many kagamimochi towers as possible, using exactly two mochi for each tower, and ensuring that every pair satisfies the elders\u2019 rule.\n\nOn the morning of the festival, the chief calls out the sizes of each mochi in turn, in ascending order. The villagers must then determine, for the given number of mochi and their respective sizes, the greatest number of kagamimochi towers that can be assembled at once\u2014using as many mochi as possible, but never breaking the sacred stacking rule. The challenge is to find this maximum number, which the villagers refer to as their \"greatest blessing\" for the year.\n\nFor each festival, the proceedings begin with the chief announcing a single number\u2014the total count of mochi prepared for the ritual. Next, the chief lists the sizes of all mochi, each separated by a space, in their natural ascending order. At the festival\u2019s close, a single number is proclaimed: the maximum number of kagamimochi towers that can be built according to the rules. This number represents the villagers\u2019 skill and fortune for the season.\n\nConsider the following festival chronicles:\n\n- In one festival, six mochi are prepared, with sizes 2, 3, 4, 4, 7, and 10. The villagers can create three kagamimochi towers: for example, stacking 2 atop 4, 3 atop 7, and 4 atop 10, each satisfying the rule. No fourth tower is possible, so the chief announces \u201c3\u201d as the result.\n- In a smaller gathering with three mochi sized 387, 388, and 389, no pair satisfies the sacred rule\u2014no kagamimochi can be made, and so the chief solemnly declares \u201c0.\u201d\n- In a grand celebration with twenty-four mochi, starting from size 307 and rising to 792, the villagers skillfully form six kagamimochi towers, as this is the greatest number permitted by the elders\u2019 rule and the mochi at hand.\n\nThus, in Tsukimi, the festival\u2019s fortune is measured by the villagers\u2019 ability to pair their mochi wisely and respectfully, always striving for the maximal number of stable, blessed kagamimochi towers.",

The `max_kagamimochi` function takes a list of mochi sizes as input and returns the maximum number of kagamimochi towers that can be formed. The function first sorts the mochi sizes in ascending order. Then it initializes a list `dp` of the same length as the input list, where `dp[i]` is the maximum number of kagamimochi towers that can be formed using the first `i` mochi. The function then iterates over the mochi sizes, updating `dp[i]` based on whether the current mochi can be placed on top of the previous mochi. If it can, the function takes the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` (the maximum number of towers formed without the current mochi) and `dp[i - 2] + 1` (the maximum number of towers formed without the current and previous mochi). If it can't, the function sets `dp[i]` to `dp[i - 1]` (the maximum number of towers formed without the current mochi). Finally, the function returns `dp[-1]`, which is the maximum number of kagamimochi towers that can be formed using all the mochi.\n\nThe main part of the program reads the number of mochi and their sizes from stdin, calls the `max_kagamimochi` function with the mochi sizes, and writes the result to stdout.\n",

Every traveler who wishes to cross from the first to the last tile must obey the ancient customs of movement: they may only stride forward by a distance chosen freely between A and B tiles (inclusive), never stepping backward nor leaping too far ahead, and never landing beyond the final tile. However, not all tiles are welcoming\u2014some regions are marked as forbidden, cursed by old magic, and must not be touched lest the journey end in calamity.\n\nThese forbidden stretches are known to all: there are M such regions, each defined by a pair of boundaries, where the curse begins at the tile marked L_i and ends at R_i, with every tile in between shrouded in danger. The keepers of Linaria have strictly ordered these regions so that none overlap and each is separated from the next by at least one safe tile, but all are nestled somewhere between the second and the penultimate tile, leaving the first and last tiles untouched by darkness.\n\nThe challenge for any brave soul is thus: starting from the very first tile, can you, by repeatedly choosing a stride length between A and B and landing only on safe, uncursed tiles, reach the fabled Nth tile at the eastern edge? Each step must be carefully chosen so that the landing tile is neither beyond the causeway\u2019s end nor within the shadow of a forbidden region.\n\nTo seek the answer, the traveler is presented with a scroll detailing the journey\u2019s terms. The first line of the scroll reveals four numbers: the total number of tiles (N), the count of forbidden regions (M), and the smallest and largest allowable stride lengths (A and B). The next M lines each reveal a pair of numbers, marking the start and end of each forbidden stretch. The traveler must declare, after thoughtful planning, a single word: \u201cYes\u201d if the journey can be completed according to these customs, or \u201cNo\u201d if the path is blocked by fate.\n\nConsider these tales from Linaria\u2019s archives:  \n\u2014 In one journey, with 24 tiles, 2 forbidden regions (from 7 to 8 and from 17 to 20), and strides allowed from 3 to 5, a traveler can leap: from tile 1 to 6, then to 9, 12, 16, 21, and finally to 24, thus proclaiming \u201cYes.\u201d  \n\u2014 In another, with 30 tiles, a single forbidden stretch from 4 to 24, and strides of 5 to 8, the traveler finds all possible landings blocked and must utter \u201cNo.\u201d  \n\u2014 In a third tale, with 100 tiles and four scattered forbidden regions, and strides between 10 and 11, the careful traveler finds a thread of safe tiles and completes the pilgrimage, declaring \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThus, the saga of Linaria\u2019s causeway is one of calculation and caution, where every rule of movement and shadowed tile must be weighed, and every journey\u2019s fate\u2014success or failure\u2014proclaimed with certainty at the end.",

        "question_content": "In the land of Kagami, the townsfolk are famous for their intricate kagamimochi towers\u2014delicate stacks of rice cakes crafted for festivals and celebrations. Each mochi, hand-shaped by artisans, comes in a variety of sizes, and the elders have long preserved a scroll listing all the mochi in precise ascending order of their size. The number of mochi in the collection is represented by the symbol N, and the i-th mochi (counted from the smallest) has a size known only to the scroll-keepers.\n\nAccording to the traditions of Kagami, there is a sacred rule: to build a kagamimochi, one must place a smaller rice cake atop a larger one, but only if the one on top is no more than half the size of the one below. This decree ensures stability and beauty in each stack, and it is strictly enforced by the Council of Mochi Stacking. No pair may break this rule, and no mochi may be used in more than one kagamimochi at a time.\n\nOn festival eves, the townsfolk receive a series of requests\u2014each request is a challenge from a visiting noble. For each request, the noble selects a segment of the scroll, specifying two positions: the beginning and the end of the segment, which are denoted by the symbols L and R. Only the mochi listed between these two positions (inclusive) may be used for that noble\u2019s challenge. The noble then asks: using only these chosen mochi, how many kagamimochi towers can be assembled at once, pairing the rice cakes according to the ancient rule?\n\nThe challenge for the artisans is clear: for each noble\u2019s request, they must determine the greatest number of kagamimochi that can be created simultaneously. This means selecting the largest possible number of pairs\u2014without reusing any mochi\u2014so that every pair abides by the stacking rule. The artisans must answer every noble\u2019s challenge as efficiently as possible.\n\nWhen a festival is at hand, the scroll-keepers announce the following to the town:  \n- First, the number of mochi in the collection (N) is read aloud.  \n- Next, the sizes of each mochi, in order, are listed.  \n- Then, the number of noble requests (Q) is revealed.  \n- For each request, a pair of numbers is given, indicating the starting and ending positions in the scroll (L and R).  \nFor every noble, the artisans must respond with a single number: the greatest possible count of kagamimochi stacks that can be made for that request, each answer proclaimed on its own line.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the following moments from previous festivals:  \nIn one instance, the scroll listed eleven mochi with sizes (1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 20), and five nobles made their requests. For the noble who selected mochi two through five (sizes 1, 2, 3, 4), the artisans crafted two kagamimochi: one by stacking the mochi of size 1 on 3, and another by placing the 2 on 4. For the noble who chose the entire collection, five kagamimochi were made, such as stacking 1 on 2, 1 on 3, 4 on 10, 4 on 11, and 7 on 20. In some cases, such as when only the first two mochi (both size 1) were chosen, no kagamimochi could be made, as the stacking rule could not be satisfied.\n\nThus, the artisans of Kagami continue their legacy, forever seeking the most splendid and numerous kagamimochi towers for each noble\u2019s challenge\u2014always respecting the ancient rules, always maximizing the joy and wonder of their festival.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeria, there exists an ancient tradition among the merchants of the Grand Bazaar. Every day, the merchants receive mysterious scrolls, each sealed and marked with a cryptic three-symbol code. These codes are not random; they hold the secret to unlocking the day's trading fortunes. The first symbol is always a number, representing the Merchant\u2019s Guild of the day, while the last symbol is also a number, symbolizing the day's chosen Fortune Keeper. Between them stands the enigmatic rune 'x', the old sign of union and collaboration among guilds.\n\nThe society of Numeria is governed by strict codes for these scrolls. The Guild number at the scroll's opening must always be a single digit, chosen from one to nine, symbolizing one of the nine great merchant houses. The Fortune Keeper's number at the scroll's end must also be a single digit from the same range, representing the nine revered keepers. The rune 'x' in the middle is sacrosanct\u2014never replaced, never omitted, always binding the two numbers with its ancient significance.\n\nOn each market morning, the appointed Scribe is handed a single scroll. The Scribe's duty is clear: interpret the code by uncovering the two numbers, and then, following the city\u2019s tradition, combine the Guild\u2019s strength and the Keeper\u2019s fortune by multiplying these two numbers together. The result is then announced in the central square as the market\u2019s guiding number for the day\u2014no embellishment, no adornment, just the pure product of the two chosen figures.\n\nWhen a Scribe receives such a scroll, it is always presented as a single line, exactly three symbols long. The Scribe must read this line, extract the numbers at the two ends, and declare their product, and only their product, as an integer, to the eager crowd.\n\nFor example, on a day when the scroll is marked with the symbols \"3x8\", the Scribe knows to take the Guild number three and the Keeper number eight, multiply them, and announce twenty-four. On another occasion, if the scroll bears the code \"9x9\", the Scribe multiplies nine by nine, and so the crowd hears eighty-one. Each day, these announcements guide the market\u2019s fate, and so the Scribe\u2019s role is both solemn and essential.\n\nThus, the tradition continues: from the scroll\u2019s mysterious code, the Scribe must always deduce and declare the market\u2019s guiding number, ensuring Numeria\u2019s prosperity through the simple, yet sacred, art of multiplication.",

        "question_content": "Long ago, in the Kingdom of Factorialis, there existed a grand tradition among the mathematicians of the realm. They revered a unique sequence of magical rituals, each performed by a council of sages. The number of sages participating in a ritual determined its complexity: the first sage would cast a spell of strength one, the second would double it, the third would triple it, and so on, until each sage had contributed. The combined force of their magic\u2014always the product of these efforts\u2014was known as the Ritual\u2019s Power.\n\nIn Factorialis, the Ritual\u2019s Power was not just a measure of might; it was the bedrock of their society\u2019s order. Each integer greater than one could, in some rare and special cases, be traced back to exactly one council whose ritual\u2019s power matched it perfectly. The society held a sacred rule: for any such power, there would exist one\u2014and only one\u2014council size that could produce it through their sequentially multiplied efforts.\n\nOne day, the High Sage received a sealed parchment, bearing a single number\u2014a Ritual\u2019s Power, greater than one and no larger than three times ten to the eighteenth. The parchment stated that this number, without exception, was the product of the ritual from one particular council, and the sages were tasked to uncover the exact number of participants in that council. Their challenge: to discover, with precision and without error, the unique council size whose ritual produced the given power.\n\nThe sages were to read the parchment, which contained only the Ritual\u2019s Power, written plainly. Their duty was to announce, for all to hear, the number of sages who had joined hands to perform the ritual resulting in that power. In other words, upon receiving the number, they would reveal the council size whose tradition, when followed precisely, would yield the Ritual\u2019s Power described.\n\nLet us consider two tales from the annals of Factorialis. In one, a parchment bore the number six. The sages quickly recalled that when three of their number performed the ritual\u2014one after another, multiplying their efforts\u2014the result was indeed six. Thus, they declared the answer to be three. In another story, the parchment revealed a far mightier number: two hundred forty-three quadrillion, two hundred ninety trillion, two hundred thousand, eight hundred seventeen million, six hundred sixty-four thousand. After much deliberation, the sages determined that only a council of twenty could muster such a power, for their sequential efforts\u2014twenty multiplied by all those before\u2014would achieve just that.\n\nSuch was the way of Factorialis: given a number, always greater than one and within the realm\u2019s grandest limits, the sages would reveal the unique council size whose ritual, performed in sacred order, produced that power exactly.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient realm of Geometria, the world was paved with an endless expanse of perfect, unit-sized tiles, each one a flawless square. The wise Geometers, keepers of the plane, had long studied the subtle interplay between these tiles and the mystical circles that could be drawn upon their world. Of particular interest was a legendary ritual: to summon a great Circle of Power, whose size was dictated by a magical integer known as the Radius, denoted by the symbol R. This circle would always appear precisely centered atop the heart of one chosen tile.\n\nThe society of Geometria was governed by a set of precise and unyielding laws. For a tile to be considered wholly embraced by the Circle of Power, it was not enough for its center to be within the circle\u2019s bounds; rather, all four of its sacred corners\u2014the points marking its north-eastern, north-western, south-eastern, and south-western tips\u2014had to lie entirely within the circle\u2019s reach. In the language of the Geometers, this meant that the distance from the circle\u2019s center to each of these four corners could never exceed the value of R. Only then would the council deem the tile fully protected by the magic of the circle.\n\nOne day, a challenge was set forth: given a chosen Radius\u2014a single, positive whole number not less than one and not greater than ten raised to the sixth power\u2014a Geometer must determine the maximal number of tiles that could be found entirely within the embrace of the Circle of Power. The chosen Radius would be provided as the only piece of input, and the Geometer would be expected to return a single number: the count of such tiles. This was not a task for the faint of heart, for the answer hinged on scrutinizing each tile according to the laws and seeing whether it met the council\u2019s strict definition of containment.\n\nThe ritual began with a solemn reading of the rules. The input would be a single integer, the Radius, presented through the sacred channels. The output would be a single integer as well: the total count of tiles that met the council\u2019s criteria, and nothing else. Every possible tile\u2014no matter how distant\u2014must be considered, provided its four corners all lay within the circle. The Geometer\u2019s goal was not simply to find some suitable tiles, but to discover them all, so that the council\u2019s tally would be complete and correct.\n\nTo help the next generation of Geometers, the elders preserved examples from past rituals. When the Radius was set to two, the council counted five tiles completely contained within the Circle of Power: the central tile and its four immediate neighbors. For a Radius of four, the tally rose to thirty-seven. And when the Radius reached twenty-six, the count soared to two thousand and twenty-five. Thus, the wisdom of the ancients was passed down, ensuring that those who came after could navigate the endless plane and the mysteries of the Circle of Power with confidence and precision.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeria, merchants take pride in their grand bazaar, famed for its near-endless supplies. There are N distinct categories of goods in this market, and each stall holder is so well-stocked that they can provide up to ten raised to the hundredth power units of their wares\u2014an amount so vast that no ordinary buyer could ever exhaust their inventory. The townsfolk, when wishing to purchase, may select any non-negative count of each type of good, with no fear of running out.\n\nHowever, the bazaar operates under a peculiar economic law, set forth by the Council of Merchants. For any given type of product, the cost to buy a batch grows dramatically: if a customer wishes to purchase a batch of k units from a particular stall, the price is not simply a multiple, but rather the square of the batch size, multiplied by that product\u2019s unique price tag. Thus, the cost for k units from the ith stall is k squared times the stall\u2019s price. Each stall\u2019s price is announced at sunrise, and is known to all who enter.\n\nOn any given market day, a buyer might arrive with a purse containing no more than M coins\u2014where M is a large but finite sum, often up to ten raised to the eighteenth power. The Council has decreed that, on each shopping trip, the total coin spent by any individual must never exceed the contents of their purse. The shrewdest buyers seek to maximize the number of items they can carry home, stretching their coins as far as Numeria\u2019s laws allow.\n\nThe challenge, then, is this: Given the number of stalls (N), the contents of your purse (M), and the price tags displayed at each stall (in order), determine the greatest total number of goods you can legally purchase, taking full advantage of the rules. The objective is not simply to buy something from every stall, but to maximize the sum of all items bought, without ever overstepping the spending limit. All decisions must be made with careful attention to the escalating cost formula and the differences in base prices between stalls.\n\nTo participate in this quest, a buyer must present the Council with a scroll containing: first, two numbers (N and M), followed by a row listing the N prices\u2014one for each stall in the marketplace. The Council will then return a single number: the maximum total count of goods that can be purchased under the rules, given those prices and the purse\u2019s contents.\n\nLet us look at how this unfolds in practice. Suppose a buyer faces three stalls, with a purse containing nine coins, and the stalls display prices of four, one, and nine. If the buyer acquires one good from the first stall and two from the second, the total cost is one squared times four, plus two squared times one, totaling eight coins. Purchasing even a single more item would push the total cost beyond the purse\u2019s limit, so the maximum number of goods that can be bought is three. In another scenario, with ten stalls and a purse of one thousand coins, and prices of two, fifteen, six, five, twelve, one, seven, nine, seventeen, and two, a careful buyer can manage to walk away with fifty-three items in total.\n\nThus, in the city of Numeria, wisdom lies in understanding not only the abundance of goods, but the hidden mathematics of their purchase\u2014a challenge to maximize one\u2019s bounty without ever breaking the market\u2019s ancient rule.",

        "question_title": "Rated Range",
        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Codetropolis, there lived an ambitious young programmer named Takahashi. Every year, the city held a grand sequence of N coding tournaments, each with its own unique challenge and mysterious gatekeepers. These contests were not just tests of skill, but also rites of passage: each participant\u2019s journey was shaped by the rules set forth by the Tournament Council, who defined for each contest a range\u2014a pair of numbers, the lower and upper bounds of eligibility for that event\u2019s bonus.\n\nThe Council\u2019s decree was as follows: for each contest in the sequence, only those whose current prestige (known as their \"rating\") lay somewhere between the contest\u2019s two secret numbers (inclusive) would find their abilities sharpened, gaining exactly one point of rating from that contest. If a participant\u2019s rating did not fit within that contest\u2019s prescribed range, they would move on, unchanged, to the next challenge. These rules were enforced strictly, and each contest\u2019s range could be as wide or as narrow as the Council wished, but always with the lower bound no greater than the upper, and both never exceeding half a million. The number of contests could be as many as twice ten to the fifth power.\n\nNow, Takahashi found himself at a crossroads: he wished to know, for a variety of possible starting ratings, how far he could climb after passing through all N contests, following the Council\u2019s rules to the letter. The city\u2019s scholars posed Q different starting scenarios, each with a single initial rating, and challenged Takahashi to determine his final standing after all contests, assuming he started with that rating each time. The number of scenarios could reach up to three times ten to the fifth power, and each starting rating would be a positive integer no greater than half a million.\n\nFor each scenario, Takahashi must begin with the given starting rating, and then, moving through the contests in the order decreed, check whether his current rating fits within the contest\u2019s allowed range. If it does, he gains exactly one point and proceeds; if not, he continues unchanged. The task is to determine, for each scenario, the exact rating Takahashi would possess after completing all contests, following the rules as efficiently and completely as possible.\n\nTo communicate with the Tournament Council, the city\u2019s scribes require the following: first, a declaration of how many contests lie ahead. Then, for each contest, the lower and upper bounds of its eligibility range. Next, the number of scenarios to consider, followed by the starting rating for each. In response, the scribes expect a single number for each scenario, each on its own line, representing Takahashi\u2019s final rating after all contests.\n\nFor example, imagine the Council announces five contests, with the following eligibility ranges: from 1 to 5, 1 to 3, 3 to 6, 2 to 4, and 4 to 7. Suppose Takahashi\u2019s rating is tested with three starting values: 3, 2, and 5. In the first case, his journey would lead him to a final rating of 6; in the second, he would also reach 6; and in the third, he would rise to 8. In each case, the steps through the contests\u2014whether his rating increased or remained the same\u2014reflect the Council\u2019s laws. The same logic applies for any set of contests and starting ratings, as demonstrated in further records from the city\u2019s archives.\n\nThus, Takahashi\u2019s quest is clear: for each possible beginning, trace the journey through the contests, faithfully applying the Council\u2019s rules, and report the final rating reached at the end of the sequence.",

        "question_title": "Odd Even Graph",
        "question_content": "In the land of Numeria, a grand annual contest is held among the city\u2019s scholars. Each year, the council selects a gathering of N distinguished scholars, where N is always an even number. These scholars, each bearing a unique badge from the first to the Nth, are tasked with forming secret societies. The societies must be such that every scholar is connected\u2014directly or through a chain of friendships\u2014to every other, and no two societies can have the same pair of scholars linked more than once, nor can a scholar form a link to themselves. The council is especially interested in the societies where the total number of friendship links formed is at least one less than the number of scholars, and at most the largest number of unique pairs that can be formed among N scholars. \n\nThe council has established an intriguing rule for the contest: starting from the first scholar, the entire gathering must be split perfectly in half by the journey of friendship. That is, if one were to count for each scholar how many steps it would take to reach them from the first scholar by traversing these links, exactly half of the scholars must stand at an even number of steps away, and the other half at an odd number of steps. This balance is considered a sign of harmony in Numerian society. No society may violate this law if they wish to be recognized by the council.\n\nEach year, the council announces a sacred prime number, known as P, which is used to record the results. For every possible number of friendship links\u2014from just enough to connect everyone, up to the maximum number of unique friendships\u2014the scholars must determine how many valid societies can be formed that obey the council's balance law. However, the scholars are only to report the remainder of this count when divided by P, as per Numerian custom.\n\nThe contest begins with a proclamation: the council will first announce the number of scholars N and the sacred prime P. The scholars must then, for every allowed number of friendship links (from one less than the number of scholars, up to the greatest number of unique pairs), announce in order a single line of numbers\u2014the count of societies for each possible number of links, each count reduced modulo P. This is all that is required to satisfy the council\u2019s decree.\n\nFor example, when the gathering consists of four scholars and the sacred prime is 998244353, the scholars find that with three friendship links, there are twelve harmonious societies; with four, there are nine; with five, three; and with six, none. Thus, they announce: \u201c12 9 3 0.\u201d In another year, with six scholars and their own sacred prime of 924844033, the scholars\u2019 proclamation is: \u201c810 2100 3060 3030 2230 1210 450 100 10 0 0.\u201d In a more ambitious gathering of ten, the results are far grander but the reporting follows the same ritual, with each number reflecting the count of harmonious societies for that many links, always reduced by the sacred prime.\n\nThus, the traditions of Numeria ensure that every year\u2019s contest is both a test of combinatorial ingenuity and a celebration of balance and unity among its scholars, with the records preserved in the timeless language of mathematics.",

It first initializes a list of dictionaries `dp` where `dp[i]` is a dictionary that maps the number of links to the number of ways to form societies with `i` links. The base case is `dp[0][0] = 1` because there is one way to form a society with 0 links. For each `i` from 1 to `n`, it copies the previous state `dp[i-1]` to `dp[i]` and then updates `dp[i]` by adding the ways to form societies with `j` links to `dp[i][j+1]` for each `j` from `i-1` to `0`. The number of ways to form societies with `j` links is added to the number of ways to form societies with `i` links by adding the ways to form societies with `j` links to the ways to form societies with `i` links. The result is a list of the number of ways to form societies with `i` links for each `i` from 0 to `n`, reduced by the sacred prime `p`.

The `dp` table is initialized with `dp[i][0] = 1` for all `i` and `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j` (except `dp[0][0]`). Then, for each `i` from 1 to `n`, it calculates the number of valid societies for each `j` from 1 to `i` by adding the number of valid societies for `i - 1` scholars and `j - 1` links and the number of valid societies for `i - 1` scholars and `j` links.

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Quintopolis, there exists a prestigious club known as the Ascendants, whose five council seats are always filled by the city's most promising young leaders. Admission to the council follows a strict tradition: the five candidates, each bearing a unique badge numbered from the smallest to the largest, must arrange themselves in a line. However, this is no ordinary lineup\u2014each year, the order of the badges is shuffled in a secret ceremony, ensuring that no two years begin with the same arrangement.\n\nThe council\u2019s charter lays out a peculiar rule of order. Only once, and only between two neighbors, may a pair exchange places in an attempt to restore the true ascending order of badges. The law is clear: the council must determine whether the perfect order\u2014where the badges are lined up from the smallest to the largest\u2014can be achieved by making just a single such neighborly swap. No more, no less.\n\nUpon gathering for the ceremony, the five candidates stand in their initial order, each displaying their badge for all to see. The city\u2019s scribe records these numbers in a single line, separated by spaces, as the official record of that year\u2019s starting arrangement. The council's challenge is then set: can the order be perfected with one and only one adjacent exchange? If so, the scribe is instructed to inscribe \"Yes\" in the annals; if not, \"No\" is written instead.\n\nThe charter further decrees that there must always be exactly five candidates, each with a distinct badge from the set of the smallest to the largest possible values, and that every possible arrangement is fair game. No badge is ever missing, and no two badges are alike. The council seeks not just any solution, but the assurance that a single swap\u2014no more, no less\u2014can bring about complete harmony. If the lineup is already perfect, the council still demands a swap, for the ritual must be performed exactly once.\n\nConsider a few chronicles from Quintopolis\u2019s history. In one year, the badges read \"1 2 4 3 5\"\u2014a single exchange between the third and fourth candidates restored order, so \"Yes\" was inscribed. In another, the badges were \"5 3 2 4 1\"\u2014no single neighborly swap could bring harmony, so \"No\" marked the record. In a year when the badges were already in the perfect sequence, \"1 2 3 4 5\", the absence of a swap disqualified perfection, and \"No\" was written. Yet, for the lineup \"2 1 3 4 5\", a swap between the first two candidates sufficed, and thus, \"Yes\" was celebrated.\n\nSo it is that each year, the council of Quintopolis faces this ceremonial puzzle, striving to bring order in a single, neighborly gesture, as the city\u2019s traditions demand.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient land of Numeria, a council of wise scholars is tasked with evaluating the harmony of number sequences brought forth by villagers from far and wide. Each villager arrives carrying a scroll containing a series of precious numbers, always more than one but never more than a hundred, for the council\u2019s patience is not infinite. Each of these numbers is a positive integer, no less than one and never exceeding the value of a billion, for the kingdom's counting stones do not reach beyond that.\n\nThe council holds fast to a sacred principle: a sequence is deemed harmonious\u2014worthy of celebration\u2014only if it follows the Law of Multiplicative Balance. According to this law, for any scroll to be harmonious, the relationship between each pair of consecutive numbers must remain unbroken throughout; that is, the way the first number grows or shrinks to become the second must be exactly the same as how the second becomes the third, and so on, all the way to the end. The scholars refer to this as the \"constant ratio of transformation.\" If any link in this chain is inconsistent, the sequence is declared discordant and unworthy of further study.\n\nWhen a villager presents their scroll, the first number they announce is how many treasures (numbers) are inscribed within. Following this, they recite each treasure in order, separated by spaces, so the council may judge. The council then deliberates and proclaims either a \"Yes,\" if the scroll\u2019s sequence is harmonious under the Law of Multiplicative Balance, or a \"No,\" if any irregularity is found. This judgment is always swift and final.\n\nYour role is to act as one of these scholars, carefully listening to each villager\u2019s presentation. You must decide, for every scroll presented, whether the sequence adheres to the Law of Multiplicative Balance\u2014meaning the transformation from one treasure to the next is unwavering throughout the entire scroll. Your answer must be as complete as possible: if the scroll passes the test, declare \"Yes\"; if it falters at any point, declare \"No.\"\n\nFor example, consider a villager who arrives with a scroll of length five and recites the treasures: 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48. Here, the transformation from each number to the next is always a doubling, so the council proclaims \"Yes,\" for the scroll is harmonious. Another villager brings a scroll of length three with treasures 1, 2, and 3; since the transformation from the first to the second is not matched by the transformation from the second to the third, the council responds \"No.\" Finally, should a scroll contain just two treasures, such as 10 and 8, the council still judges by the Law\u2014here, the transformation is consistent, so \"Yes\" is declared.\n\nThus, in Numeria, every scroll is weighed against the Law of Multiplicative Balance, and only those that honor its constancy are celebrated as harmonious sequences.",

        "question_title": "Paint to make a rectangle",
        "question_content": "In the land of Griddoria, there exists a grand Hall of Patterns built upon an enormous tiled floor. This floor is divided into a tapestry of rows and columns\u2014let\u2019s call the number of rows N and the number of columns M. Each tile is marked in one of three ways: some are already painted black, some are white, and some are left undecided, awaiting their fate as either black or white.\n\nThe citizens of Griddoria, devoted to symmetry and order, have established a revered tradition: whenever black tiles appear upon the Hall\u2019s floor, they must together form a perfect rectangle. In other words, there must exist a contiguous block, defined by two rows and two columns\u2014think of four boundaries, each a straight line\u2014so that every tile within is black, and every tile outside this block is white. The rules of the Hall are strict: if a tile is already black, it must be within the rectangle; if a tile is already white, it must be outside. Any undecided tile may be painted to fit this vision.\n\nNow, the steward Takahashi faces a challenge. The Hall\u2019s current state is described by N lines, each of M characters, where a hash represents a black tile, a dot a white tile, and a question mark a tile left undecided. Takahashi must determine whether it is possible to resolve every undecided tile so that all black tiles unite to form a single, unbroken rectangle\u2014no more, no less\u2014without violating the pre-painted tiles\u2019 colors.\n\nThe steward\u2019s task is thus: given the Hall\u2019s dimensions and the current state of its floor, can he orchestrate a painting where all the black tiles form a perfect rectangle, and every other tile is white? He must answer with a simple decree: \u201cYes\u201d if it is possible, or \u201cNo\u201d if the rules of the Hall make it impossible.\n\nTo convey his decision, Takahashi receives the Hall\u2019s configuration as follows: first, the two numbers N and M; then, N lines each with M characters, describing the floor\u2019s state row by row from top to bottom. His reply is a single word\u2014\u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d\u2014spoken to the assembly.\n\nFor example, on one occasion, the Hall had 3 rows and 5 columns, and the floor appeared as:\n3 5  \n.#?#.  \n.?#?.  \n?...?  \nTakahashi could, by careful painting, make all black tiles form a rectangle, so he declared \u201cYes.\u201d Yet on another day, with a 3 by 3 floor:\n3 3  \n?##  \n#.#  \n##?  \nhe found that a white tile blocked the formation of a perfect black rectangle, and so he declared \u201cNo.\u201d In the rare case where the Hall was a single tile, already black:\n1 1  \n#  \nthe answer was, naturally, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThus, in Griddoria, the harmony of the Hall of Patterns rests upon the steward\u2019s wisdom to discern whether the tradition of the black rectangle can be honored.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling land of Numeria, there exists a peculiar tradition among its scholars: The Gathering of the N Bags. Each year, a group of N mystic bags is assembled in the great hall, each bag containing a secret stash of precious stones. The count of stones in each bag is determined at the start\u2014sometimes as few as one, sometimes as many as one followed by seventeen zeros. The number of bags, too, is always between two and twelve, as decreed by the ancient rules.\n\nThe scholars of Numeria are allowed to perform a curious operation as many times as they wish: they may select any two bags, and pour the entire contents of the first into the second, leaving the first bag empty and increasing the count of the second by the amount transferred. There are no limits to how many times, or in what order, this operation can be performed. However, once all desired transfers are complete, the number of stones in each bag is set, and the scholars turn their attention to a final, mysterious calculation.\n\nThis calculation is governed by the Law of the Mystic Mask, which requires the scholars to determine the \"Enigmatic Sum\" of the bags: for every bag, they look at the number of stones remaining, and combine them using a ritual called the XOR. In this rite, the stones are imagined as rows of glowing gems, where each position in the row is lit only if an odd number of stones shine at that spot across all bags. It is known that the order in which bags are considered does not matter for this calculation.\n\nYour quest is to determine, for a given initial arrangement of stones, how many distinct Enigmatic Sums are possible, no matter how the scholars perform their transfers. The ultimate goal is not just to find one such sum, but to discover the full range of possibilities, considering every sequence of moves the scholars might make\u2014no matter how clever or circuitous.\n\nTo begin, the keepers of the tradition will provide you with the number of bags (N), followed by a list describing how many stones lie within each bag at the start. Your answer must be a single number: the count of distinct Enigmatic Sums that could ever be produced by any sequence of transfers, from none at all to the most elaborate redistribution. \n\nLet us see how this plays out in the halls of Numeria. Imagine three bags holding 2, 5, and 7 stones. The scholars might, for example, pour all stones from the first into the third, leaving the bags with 0, 5, and 9 stones. The Enigmatic Sum in this case is 0 XOR 5 XOR 9, which equals 12. Through various other sequences, they discover that the only possible sums are 0, 12, and 14\u2014three in total. In another gathering, with two bags each holding one hundred quadrillion stones, only two sums are possible: 0 and 100000000000000000. In yet another session with six bags filled with 71, 74, 45, 34, 31, and 60 stones, the possibilities grow to 84. Thus, in every case, the scholars seek not just a solution, but the full tapestry of what might be, as dictated by the rules of their world.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Nutriopolis, the Council of Health has established a grand challenge. There are N distinct delicacies spread throughout the city, each infused with a powerful dose of one of three vital elixirs\u2014known among the people as the First, Second, and Third Vitamins. Every delicacy is lovingly crafted to bestow a precise quantity of its assigned vitamin, and each requires a specific number of calories to consume. The citizens, led by the determined Takahashi, must carefully select their meals, for the Council has decreed a strict upper limit on total calorie intake, denoted as X, to ensure the wellbeing of all.\n\nThe society follows immutable rules: every delicacy offers its benefit in only one vitamin, never more, and always in a set amount. The calorie content of each dish is fixed and must not cause the sum of all chosen dishes to surpass the Council\u2019s calorie decree. Furthermore, no partial servings or combination recipes are allowed; only whole dishes may be consumed, and any combination of them is permitted\u2014including the possibility of abstaining from all.\n\nThe Council\u2019s annual trial is thus: Takahashi may select any combination of the city\u2019s N delicacies, provided that the total calories do not exceed X. For each vitamin, he will tally the total intake gained from his chosen dishes. His success is measured not by the total bounty, but by the lowest of these three vitamin tallies\u2014the weakest link in his nutritional chain. The ultimate aim is to maximize this weakest link, achieving the highest possible minimum intake among the three vitamins without ever exceeding the calorie limit.\n\nTo participate, Takahashi receives a parchment detailing the available delicacies. The parchment begins with two numbers: the total count of delicacies N and the city\u2019s calorie decree X. Each of the following N lines describes a delicacy: the type of vitamin it bestows (First, Second, or Third), the quantity of vitamin it provides, and the calories required to consume it. At the end of his deliberations, Takahashi is to report a single number: the best possible minimum vitamin intake he can achieve while obeying the calorie law.\n\nLet us see how Takahashi might fare in practice. In one year, the Council offers five delicacies and sets the calorie decree at twenty-five. The dishes are as follows: one provides eight units of the First Vitamin for five calories; another gives three units of the Second Vitamin for five calories; a third offers seven units of the Second Vitamin for ten calories; the fourth grants two units of the Third Vitamin for five calories; the last bestows three units of the Third Vitamin for ten calories. Takahashi, after careful selection, can consume the first, second, fourth, and fifth dishes, reaching a total of eight units of the First Vitamin, three of the Second, and five of the Third, consuming exactly twenty-five calories. The weakest link in his intake is three units\u2014the best he can do, as reaching four units for each vitamin would break the calorie law.\n\nIn another year, only two delicacies are available, each providing a bountiful two hundred thousand units of either the First or Second Vitamin for a single calorie each, but none for the Third. Even if Takahashi feasts upon both, he cannot gain any units of the Third Vitamin, and so his weakest link remains at zero. In Nutriopolis, the challenge is always to balance the city's bounty with the Council\u2019s decree, seeking the greatest possible minimum among all three vital elixirs.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient land of Numeria, there existed a grand Academy of Numbers, where the wise sages studied mysteries hidden within long tapestries of numbers. Each tapestry consisted of a row of N stones, each inscribed with a number\u2014these were the Sequence Stones, and their inscriptions ranged from the smallest to the largest, covering values no greater than the number of stones themselves. The sages, ever curious, would examine every possible segment of consecutive stones, from the shortest single-stone sequence to the entire tapestry itself.\n\nWithin the Academy, there existed a peculiar tradition regarding the cleansing of a blackboard. Whenever a group of sages selected a segment of stones\u2014say, from the L-th to the R-th\u2014they would carefully copy the numbers from those stones onto a blackboard, preserving their order. The rules of Numeria dictated that the only way to erase numbers from the blackboard was through a special ritual: the sages could choose any range of numbers (say, from a lower bound to an upper bound), but only if every number within that range was present somewhere on the blackboard at that moment. Upon invoking the ritual, all occurrences of every number in that chosen range would be wiped from the board instantly. This ritual could be repeated, each time choosing a new eligible range, until the blackboard was finally empty.\n\nThe sages prized efficiency above all. For any chosen segment of stones, they would always seek to cleanse the blackboard using the smallest number of rituals possible. Their ultimate quest was to determine, for a given tapestry, the total sum of the fewest rituals required over all possible segments\u2014each segment being defined by a starting stone and an ending stone, with the starting position never exceeding the ending one. Thus, the sages would consider every possible pair of starting and ending stones, calculate the minimum number of rituals needed for each, and then sum these numbers for the entire tapestry.\n\nThis noble pursuit was bound by the following tenets: the number of Sequence Stones in any tapestry could be as few as one or as many as three times ten to the fifth power. The numbers inscribed upon the stones were always positive integers, never exceeding the count of stones in the tapestry. Each stone\u2019s inscription was meticulously recorded in order.\n\nWhen a new tapestry was presented, the sages received its length, followed by the inscriptions on each stone, all in a single line. They were expected to return a single number: the sum of the minimum number of rituals required for each possible segment, as decreed by Numerian tradition.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a tapestry of four stones inscribed with the numbers 1, 3, 1, and 4. For the complete tapestry, the sages would first write 1, 3, 1, and 4 on the blackboard. They could choose to erase all 1s in one ritual, then erase the remaining 3 and 4 in another, for a total of two rituals. By performing similar calculations for every possible segment, they would find the grand sum to be sixteen. For a tapestry of five stones marked 3, 1, 4, 2, and 4, the sum would be twenty-three. For a tapestry of ten stones bearing the sequence 5, 1, 10, 9, 2, 5, 6, 9, 1, and 6, the sages would find the sum to be one hundred and twenty-nine.\n\nThus, the sages of Numeria continued their quest, ever seeking the most elegant solutions to the cleansing of their magical blackboard, guided by the rules and rituals that defined their scholarly world.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling realm of Numeria, there exists a grand tradition known as the Festival of Sequences. Every year, the elders present a challenge to the citizens: given a sacred number, known only as N, the people must gather all the tokens numbered from the first up to the N-th, each bearing a unique value. The central custom is to arrange these tokens in every possible order\u2014each arrangement forming a parade known as a \"permutation.\" For each parade, the values on the tokens are read aloud in sequence, and the digits are spoken one after another, forming a grand number without pause or leading silence. This spoken number is revered as the parade\u2019s \u201csequence value.\u201d\n\nThe society of Numeria has established certain unbreakable customs for this ritual. First, every parade must use all tokens, and each token can be used only once per parade. The tokens are always numbered consecutively from the first to the N-th, with no omissions or duplicates. When the value on a token is announced, it is always read in its true form, without any unnecessary beginnings\u2014meaning that the digit string for each token never starts with an unneeded zero. The sequence value of a parade is always determined by reading and joining the digits of the tokens from the front of the parade to the end, forming a single, uninterrupted numeral.\n\nThe Festival\u2019s grand challenge is as follows: the sum of all sequence values, formed by every possible parade of tokens, must be calculated. Yet, the wizards of Numeria have decreed that numbers in the realm must never grow unwieldy. To keep the sum within manageable bounds, they have established a magical barrier\u2014any sum must be reported only as its remainder after dividing by 998,244,353, a sacred modulus that keeps all answers within the realm\u2019s limits.\n\nTo participate, a Numerian is given a scroll containing a single integer N, representing the number of tokens. The citizen\u2019s task is to present, on a single line, the sum of all possible sequence values formed by every permutation of the tokens numbered from one up to N, ensuring the result is reduced according to the magical barrier. The scroll\u2019s input is always a single positive integer, and the response must always be a single integer as well.\n\nFor instance, when the elders decree that N is three, the citizens enumerate all six possible parades: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). Reading the tokens in order, the sequence values are 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, and 321. Summing these gives 1,332\u2014the correct total to present to the elders. In another year, if the sacred number is three hundred ninety, the correct answer to present is 727,611,652. Or, in a legendary festival where the number was seventy-nine thousand two hundred twenty-three, the answer was 184,895,744. Thus, the people of Numeria honor their customs, and the challenge of the Festival of Sequences continues, year after year.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient realm of Octavia, navigation was a revered art, and the people honored the eight cardinal and intercardinal winds. Each wind held dominion over a particular path: north, east, west, and south, as well as the four that swept between them\u2014northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest. These winds were known by their sacred syllables: \u201cN\u201d for north, \u201cE\u201d for east, \u201cW\u201d for west, \u201cS\u201d for south, \u201cNE\u201d for northeast, \u201cNW\u201d for northwest, \u201cSE\u201d for southeast, and \u201cSW\u201d for southwest.\n\nAmong the Octavians, there existed a fundamental law: every wind had a counterpart, a force blowing in the exact opposite direction. It was a societal expectation that for every journey begun under one wind\u2019s guidance, there existed a return path led by its opposing wind. Thus, north always faced south, east was forever opposed by west, northeast mirrored northwest, and so on. This balance was both a navigational principle and a spiritual norm, ensuring the world remained in harmonious symmetry.\n\nOne day, the Council of Wayfinders issued a decree: travelers would be presented with a single wind\u2019s symbol, chosen from the sacred set. Their task was to name, without hesitation, the wind that would guide them home\u2014the wind directly opposite to the one given. The council made it clear that the symbol presented would always be valid, never straying from the eight revered winds.\n\nTo participate, a wayfinder would enter the council chamber and be handed a slip bearing one of the wind\u2019s symbols. The council would accept this symbol as the sole input for the challenge. The wayfinder\u2019s duty was to announce, as their output, only the symbol of the opposing wind, thus demonstrating their mastery of Octavia\u2019s navigational lore.\n\nLet us walk through two tales from the council\u2019s records. In the first, a wayfinder was presented with the symbol \u201cN.\u201d Without delay, they proclaimed \u201cS,\u201d invoking the southern wind that stands opposite to north. In another trial, the slip bore \u201cSE.\u201d The wayfinder, recalling the symmetry of Octavia\u2019s winds, answered \u201cNW,\u201d the northwest wind that is forever opposed to the southeast. Thus, the tradition endures, ensuring that every journey in Octavia may always find its way home.",

        "question_content": "In the kingdom of Griddoria, two great tapestries are woven each year: the Grand Weave and the Miniature Frame. The Grand Weave is a majestic cloth, square in shape, whose side length is denoted in the land\u2019s records as N. Each thread in this tapestry may be either as pale as moonlight or as dark as midnight, represented by a dot or a hash, respectively. The Miniature Frame, smaller but no less intricate, is also square, with its own side length M, always less than or equal to that of the Grand Weave.\n\nThe people of Griddoria abide by a peculiar tradition. Whenever a new Miniature Frame is crafted, the Master Weaver must search for a place within the Grand Weave where the pattern of the Miniature Frame aligns perfectly\u2014each thread, whether pale or dark, must match precisely with the corresponding thread in a section of the Grand Weave. This search is bound by the rules of their society: the Miniature Frame must not hang over the edge; it must fit entirely within the boundaries of the Grand Weave, starting from some row and column, both counted from the upper left. The starting row and column are celebrated as a pair of numbers, both at least one, and neither greater than the difference between N and M plus one.\n\nThe quest is not for just any such alignment, but for the one and only place where the Miniature Frame\u2019s design matches the Grand Weave\u2019s threads exactly, with no misalignment at any position. It is a matter of great pride that, for each quest, there is always exactly one such perfect spot, and the Master Weaver must discover it.\n\nTo record this process, the chroniclers of Griddoria require that the tale begin with two numbers, N and M, inscribed on a scroll. Next, the Grand Weave is described line by line, each line containing exactly N symbols, either a dot or a hash. Then, the Miniature Frame is described in the same manner, line by line, each with exactly M symbols. When the Master Weaver finds the perfect alignment, they declare the row and column where the Miniature Frame\u2019s top-left corner must be placed, announcing these two numbers on a single line.\n\nLet us look to the Chronicles for examples. In one tale, the Grand Weave is three by three, and the Miniature Frame is two by two. The Grand Weave\u2019s threads are arranged as such: \"#.#\", \"..#\", and \"##.\". The Miniature Frame is woven as \" .#\", and \"#.\". The Master Weaver discovers that placing the Miniature Frame with its top-left corner at the second row and second column of the Grand Weave achieves the perfect match. In another story, a Grand Weave of size two and a Miniature Frame of size one are given. With the Grand Weave as \"#.\" and \"##\", and the Miniature Frame as \".\", the perfect alignment is found at the first row and second column.\n\nThus, the lore of Griddoria continues, each tale a testament to the artistry of their weavers and the precision of their traditions, ensuring every Miniature Frame finds its destined place within the Grand Weave.",

        "question_title": "Gravity",
        "question_content": "In the distant city of Gridoria, a land of endless columns and near-infinite heights, the people constructed a grand vertical plaza. This plaza was organized into countless floors, stretching up for nearly a billion stories, and a width of W chambers across. Each chamber could hold a single enchanted stone block, and each block was carefully placed at the start of the tale, with N such blocks, each in its own unique location. The keepers of Gridoria had a precise way of naming locations: a chamber was described by its distance from the left and its height from the plaza\u2019s foundation.\n\nGridoria was governed by a set of ancient, unyielding rules for how the blocks would behave as time ticked forward. Each passing moment, the city watched for a special event: if every chamber of the ground floor contained a block, a magical sweep would remove all blocks from the ground floor at once. After this, the remaining blocks, starting from the lowest upward, would attempt to descend. However, a block could only move downward if there was empty space directly beneath it; if it was already on the ground or resting atop another block, it stayed put. This ritual repeated endlessly, with the city\u2019s timekeepers counting the moments into the unimaginable future.\n\nOn a particular day, the scholars of Gridoria issued a challenge, providing a scroll with the exact initial arrangement of all N blocks, each described by its chamber and height. They also gave a list of Q mysteries, each describing a moment and a particular block: for each, one must decide whether that block still existed in the plaza at the specified half-moment after the given time.\n\nTo unravel these mysteries, the seeker must heed the rules: observe the initial placement of the blocks, simulate the city\u2019s rituals for the specified times, and, for each question, determine if the sought-after block remains in the plaza at that ephemeral instant, or if it has vanished into legend. The answers must be given for each question, in the order received, with \u201cYes\u201d for a block that persists and \u201cNo\u201d for one that does not.\n\nThe scrolls\u2019 format for these inquiries is as follows: the first line tells the number of blocks and the plaza\u2019s width. The next N lines each describe a block\u2019s starting chamber and floor. Then, a line reveals the number of questions, followed by Q lines, each stating a moment and the identity of the block in question. The responses must be given in order, one per line.\n\nConsider, for example, a plaza with five blocks and three chambers in width, with the blocks placed in various starting positions. Six mysteries are posed, each asking about a block at a certain moment. For each, one must report whether the block still stands or has been swept away according to the city\u2019s rules. In another tale, the plaza is narrower, and only three blocks are placed, with four questions asked. In each case, the seeker\u2019s answers\u2014\"Yes\" or \"No\"\u2014must faithfully reflect the fate of each block as dictated by Gridoria\u2019s ancient laws.\n\nThus, the fate of each block at each moment is not merely a matter of position, but of understanding the city\u2019s rituals, the movement of blocks, and the sweeping away of those that fill the ground floor. Only with careful attention to these principles can one hope to answer the scholars\u2019 challenge in full.",

        "question_title": "Hierarchical Majority Vote",
        "question_content": "In the land of Trinaria, every tale is woven from strings of fate, each strand bearing a mark\u2014either a dark rune or a light rune, inscribed as a zero or a one. The High Council of Trinaria decrees that, for every major decision, a Grand String of fate is prepared. The length of this Grand String is always a power of three, determined by a sacred number known as N, so that the string is exactly three to the power of N runes long. Each rune in the string can be either light or dark, and the Council's laws are strict: a single mistake in the runes can alter the destiny of the entire realm.\n\nThe Council follows an ancient ritual to distill the Grand String into a single, decisive rune. This ritual unfolds over N rounds. In each round, all the runes are divided into groups of three. Within every group, the prevailing rune\u2014whichever appears at least twice\u2014becomes the sole representative in the next, shorter string. This process repeats, with the new string again split into triads and the majority rune chosen from each, until only a single rune remains. This final rune is the oracle\u2019s answer to the Council\u2019s question.\n\nYet, sometimes the Council wishes to alter fate. They ponder: how many runes in the original Grand String must be changed, switching a light rune to dark or vice versa, to ensure that the final, solitary rune at the end of the ritual is reversed from its original form? The challenge is to make as few changes as possible, respecting the Council\u2019s desire for efficiency and subtlety in rewriting destiny.\n\nTo consult the Oracle, the Council presents their query in a precise format: First, they declare the sacred number N, which determines the string\u2019s length. Next, they reveal the Grand String itself\u2014a sequence of exactly three to the power of N runes, each one either a zero or a one, with no spaces. When the Oracle responds, she utters a single number: the smallest count of runes that must be altered in the Grand String to guarantee that the outcome of the ritual, after all N rounds, is the opposite of what it would have been.\n\nLet us witness an example from Trinaria\u2019s chronicles. Suppose the Council brings forth N as 2 and the Grand String as 010011101. The ritual proceeds: first, the string is split into three groups\u2014010, 011, and 101. The majority runes are 0, 1, and 1, giving a new string of 011. In the second round, 011 yields a majority of 1. If the Council wishes to change this outcome to 0, they discover that altering just one rune\u2014the fifth in the original string\u2014suffices. With this change, the process yields 001, then 0, and the Council\u2019s will is achieved with minimal interference.\n\nIn another tale, N is 1 and the Grand String is 000. The groups are simply the entire string, and the majority is clearly 0. To flip this to 1, the Council realizes that at least two runes must be changed, for only then does the majority tip to light. Thus, the Oracle would reply with the number 2.\n\nAnd so, in every corner of Trinaria, the Council\u2019s scribes and Oracles remember: the fate of the land may rest on the smallest number of changes, but the rules of the ritual are clear and unyielding, passed down through generations so that all may understand the logic and magic of the Grand String\u2019s transformation.",

It defines helper functions `count_rune` and `count_changes` to count the number of occurrences of a rune and the number of changes needed to change a rune to a target rune, respectively. The main function `solve_rec` recursively divides the Grand String into two halves and determines the majority rune in each half. If the majority runes in the left and right halves are the same, it recurses on the left half with the majority rune as the target. Otherwise, it recurses on the right half with the majority rune as the target. The function returns the minimum number of changes needed to change the majority rune to the target rune.

Each guild is home to a proud line of N families, and every family is known for a unique strength: the Artisans are famed for their skill (each with their own secret number), the Brokers for their cunning, and the Crafters for their innovation. The council of Triadica, ever eager to foster collaboration, decreed a grand challenge: to pair one family from each guild and compute a measure of their combined excellence, using a mysterious formula whispered through generations.\n\nThe council set forth the rules of this challenge. Each trio\u2014one Artisan, one Broker, and one Crafter\u2014would join forces, and their collective brilliance would be measured thus: the product of the Artisan\u2019s strength and the Broker\u2019s cunning, added to the product of the Broker\u2019s cunning and the Crafter\u2019s innovation, and finally, the product of the Crafter\u2019s innovation and the Artisan\u2019s strength. Every possible combination must be considered, and the council would then seek out the K-th most splendid measure among all these unions, where K is a number chosen by the council, never greater than the total number of possible trios nor exceeding half a million.\n\nYet, the land is not without its laws. The number of families in each guild, referred to as N, must be at least one but never more than twice one hundred thousand. The number K, the council\u2019s pick, must be at least one and at most the smaller between the total possible trios and half a million. Each family\u2019s strength, cunning, or innovation is a positive number, always at least one but never more than one billion. The council\u2019s scribes ensure that every value is a whole number.\n\nThe council gathers for the challenge. They announce that the chronicles shall be written as follows: first, the number of families and the council\u2019s chosen K will be stated. Next, the strengths of all Artisan families will be listed in order, followed by the cunning values of all Brokers, and finally the innovations of all Crafters. When the challenge is met, the scribes must record the result\u2014the K-th greatest measure found among all trios.\n\nLet us examine how the challenge unfolds in Triadica. Suppose there are two families in each guild, and the council seeks the fifth greatest measure. The strengths are 1 and 2, the cunning values are 3 and 4, and the innovations are 5 and 6. Each possible trio is formed, their measure calculated using the ancient formula, and the eight results are tallied: the fifth highest among them is 31, and so this is the answer the scribes record. In another gathering, with three families in each guild, all possessing a strength, cunning, or innovation of 100, and the council seeking the tenth largest measure, the answer is 30,000. In yet another, more complex assembly, the council\u2019s request is met with a much grander value, as calculated by the most learned in the land.\n\nThus, in Triadica, the pursuit of excellence is not merely about forming trios, but about finding the K-th most remarkable union among all possible alliances, as dictated by the council\u2019s will.",

        "question_content": "In the land of Lexiconia, there existed a grand Library of Strings, renowned for its endless shelves upon which every possible combination of the 26 lowercase runes\u2014each rune a letter from the ancient alphabet\u2014could be found. The sages of Lexiconia, keepers of the library, often pondered the relationships between these myriad strings, especially when comparing them with a cherished manuscript known as the Sacred Script. This script, always of a particular length (let us call this length N), was revered, and its exact arrangement of letters changed from time to time per the council\u2019s decree.\n\nThe society of Lexiconia had a peculiar fascination: for any given positive whole number M, they would contemplate every possible sequence of runes of length M, of which there were as many as the number of ways to arrange M runes each chosen independently from 26 options\u2014that is, 26 raised to the Mth power. The sages were especially interested in the relationship between these sequences and their Sacred Script. The most esteemed measure of similarity was the length of the longest common subsequence\u2014a tradition where, between two scripts, one would count the greatest number of runes, in order, that could be matched without rearrangement.\n\nThere were strict societal protocols for this contemplation. For each possible value K, ranging from none at all (zero) up to the full length of the Sacred Script (N), the sages sought to count, with utmost accuracy, how many of the library\u2019s length-M scripts shared with the Sacred Script a longest common subsequence of exactly K. Their calculations were always performed in cycles, wrapping around a mystical modulus known as the Number of Harmony (which, in their tongue, was 998244353), to ensure their counts never grew unmanageable.\n\nThe Council of Scribes would present the challenge thus: \"Given the length of the Sacred Script (N), the length of the library\u2019s scripts to be considered (M), and the Sacred Script itself, enumerate for each possible value of K the number of library scripts of length M whose connection to the Sacred Script is measured by a longest common subsequence of exactly K. The answer for each K, starting from zero and ascending to N, must be presented in a single proclamation, numbers separated by a single space, and all numbers considered under the Law of Harmony\u2019s modulus.\"\n\nFor instance, suppose the Sacred Script was of length two and read 'ab', and the Council decreed that M should also be two. The sages would then discover that among all possible two-letter scripts, there were 576 that shared no common subsequence with 'ab', 99 that shared exactly one matching rune in the proper order, and a single script\u2014'ab' itself\u2014that shared the full sequence. These findings would be spoken aloud as: \"576 99 1\". In another age, when the Sacred Script was 'aaa' and the decree was for scripts of length four, the sages would proclaim: \"390625 62500 3750 101\", reflecting every possible degree of resemblance.\n\nThus, through this ritual, the sages of Lexiconia preserved the harmony of knowledge, ever cataloging the kinship between their Sacred Script and the infinite possibilities that filled their library's shelves. Each proclamation, a testament to the intricate dance of similarity and difference, was etched into the annals of their world, ensuring that the mysteries of strings would endure for generations.",

It first initializes a 4-dimensional array `dp` to store the number of ways to choose `M` runes from 26 options such that the longest common subsequence has length `K`. Then it iterates over all possible choices of runes and updates the `dp` array accordingly. Finally, it prints the number of library scripts of length `M` whose connection to the Sacred Script is measured by a longest common subsequence of exactly `K`.\n",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeria, there exists a peculiar guild known as the Order of the Triad. Each season, the Order selects three apprentices, each bearing a distinct badge with a number inscribed upon it. These numbers, always whole and ranging from the humble one to the proud one hundred, represent their strengths and destinies within the guild.\n\nThe Order observes a sacred ritual: the apprentices must stand in a line, and their arrangement is not fixed\u2014any order is permitted. However, there is a revered law among the Numerians: the combined might of the first two apprentices in line, when joined through the ancient art of multiplication, must exactly equal the strength of the third apprentice. If, in any arrangement, this feat is accomplished, the Order celebrates; if not, they must try again another season.\n\nEach season, the High Scribe records the three chosen numbers in a single line upon parchment, separated by spaces. This is the only information given to the Council for their deliberation. The Council\u2019s duty is to proclaim, for each season, whether the apprentices can be arranged so that the law of the Order is fulfilled\u2014if so, they declare \"Yes\" with great fanfare; if not, they solemnly pronounce \"No.\"\n\nAs the Council sits, they ponder: for every possible arrangement of the three apprentices, is there at least one way that the product of the first two equals the third? Their task is to determine this as efficiently as possible, honoring the Order\u2019s rules and maximizing the chance for a celebration.\n\nTake for example a season where the chosen strengths are 3, 15, and 5. The Council considers all possible arrangements and finds that having the apprentices with strengths 3 and 5 stand first, their combined might is 15, matching the third apprentice\u2014so they jubilantly declare \"Yes.\" In another season, when the chosen strengths are 5, 3, and 2, no matter how the apprentices line up, the law cannot be fulfilled, and the Council must announce \"No.\"\n\nThus, the fate of the Order\u2019s celebration rests each season on the Council\u2019s careful consideration of the apprentices\u2019 arrangement, and the ancient law that binds them.",

        "question_content": "In the grand city of Numeria, there exists a council tasked with maintaining the Registry of Citizens. The city is divided into districts, each uniquely numbered from the first up to the greatest, with the total number of districts denoted by the symbol N. Each year, a list is presented to the council, containing the names of certain distinguished citizens\u2014each name corresponding to one district, and no district appearing more than once on the list. The number of names on this list is called M, and it is always true that M is at least one and never greater than N.\n\nBy law, every citizen of Numeria holds a unique district number somewhere between the first and the Nth, and no two citizens on the annual list may share the same number. The council\u2019s tradition is to identify all those citizens whose district numbers are not mentioned on the distinguished list, ensuring that no one is forgotten in the city\u2019s records. The council must always present this roster in strictly ascending order, with careful attention to accuracy and completeness.\n\nThis year, the council faces the following challenge. They are given the full count of districts, N, and the number of distinguished citizens, M. Then, they receive a roll call\u2014M unique district numbers, each between the first and Nth. The council\u2019s mission is to determine which district numbers, if any, are missing from this list. Their goal is to report exactly how many such districts exist, followed by the complete list of these missing district numbers, ordered from smallest to largest. If the list is complete and no districts are missing, the council must simply declare the count as zero and leave the record of missing districts empty.\n\nThe council receives their instructions in a formal manner: first, they are told N and M. Next, they are handed the M distinguished district numbers. Their official report must begin with the count of missing districts, and, if there are any, follow with the missing numbers, each separated by a space on the next line\u2014all in accordance with Numerian administrative protocol.\n\nTo illuminate this process, consider these tales from Numerian history. In one year, the city had ten districts and a distinguished list featuring three: districts three, nine, and two. The council found that seven districts were missing from the list, namely the first, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and tenth districts. Their report began with the number seven, followed by these districts in order. In another year, all six districts were accounted for on the list, so the council simply reported zero, with no further details. In yet another instance, only the ninth district was on the list out of nine, leading the council to report eight missing districts: the first through the eighth.\n\nThus, through careful adherence to their traditions and rules, the Numerian council ensures that every citizen\u2019s place in the grand city is recognized, and no number is left behind.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeria, a grand event is held every year known as the Parade of Bibs. In this event, a certain number of citizens, which can range from two to three hundred thousand, gather in a great hall. Each citizen is assigned a unique number from the first number up to the total number of people, and each wears a bib bearing a special number chosen from this range\u2014no two bibs display the same number. The citizens are arranged in a particular order, and each one fixates their gaze on exactly one other person in the hall, such that each observer\u2019s target is different from everyone else\u2019s.\n\nThe laws of Numeria dictate that each citizen must choose exactly one other person to stare at, and no two citizens may choose the same individual as their target. This ensures that every gaze is unique and no one is left unobserved. Furthermore, the bibs are distributed so that every number in the range is represented exactly once, and each bib is worn by one and only one person. These rules are strictly enforced by the Parade\u2019s organizers, leaving no room for ambiguity or overlap.\n\nOn this particular day, the organizers present two scrolls to the Parade\u2019s master scribe. The first scroll lists, in order, the target of each citizen\u2019s gaze: the first name on the scroll indicates the person the first citizen is staring at, the second name the person the second citizen is staring at, and so on. The second scroll lists, also in order, the bib number each citizen is wearing: the first number for the first citizen, the second for the second, and so forth. The scribe\u2019s challenge is to determine, for every bib number from the lowest to the highest, the number displayed on the bib of the person being observed by the wearer of that bib.\n\nThus, the scribe\u2019s task is as follows: for every bib number (from the smallest to the largest), she must discover the bib number worn by the person being watched by the citizen who wears that particular bib. The scribe must do this as efficiently as possible, for the Parade\u2019s grandeur is matched only by its scale, and a slow reckoning would delay the festivities.\n\nTo aid the scribe, the Parade\u2019s rules for presenting the scrolls are as follows: The first line of the report states the total number of citizens. The second line lists, in order, the number of the person each citizen stares at. The third line lists, in the same order, the bib number each citizen is wearing. The scribe must then write down a single line of numbers: for each bib number from the smallest to the largest, the bib number of the person being watched by the wearer of that bib, each separated by a space.\n\nLet us look at a couple of tales from past Parades. In one instance, with four citizens, the scrolls read: \"4 3 2 1\" and \"2 3 1 4.\" The scribe\u2019s answer was \"3 4 1 2,\" for she discovered that the wearer of bib one was watching the person with bib three, the wearer of bib two was watching the person with bib four, and so on. In another grander Parade with ten citizens, the scrolls read: \"2 6 4 3 7 8 9 10 1 5\" and \"1 4 8 2 10 5 7 3 9 6.\" The scribe, working with diligence and care, produced \"4 8 6 5 3 10 9 2 1 7\" as her answer, mapping each bib to its observed counterpart according to the Parade\u2019s intricate customs.\n\nThus, the Parade of Bibs continues, each year a celebration of order and observation, and each year the master scribe\u2019s challenge is renewed: to unravel the web of gazes and bibs that define Numeria\u2019s greatest festival.",

        "question_content": "In the distant realm of Polyhedria, the citizens are masters of games of chance, and their society revolves around the mystical practice of dicecraft. In this land, there are N guilds, each renowned for forging a unique die, whose faces are etched with sacred numbers. The i-th guild\u2019s die is famed for having as many faces as the number K bestowed upon it, and on these faces are inscribed the numbers chosen by the guild\u2019s artisans\u2014some faces may bear the same number more than once. Whenever a die is cast, the magic of Polyhedria ensures that each face is equally likely to be revealed to the world.\n\nPolyhedria\u2019s Council of Games has decreed several rules that shape the dicecraft tradition. First, the number of guilds must always be at least two, but never more than one hundred\u2014a matter of balance and fairness. Each die must have at least one face, and the total number of faces across all dice in the land cannot surpass one hundred thousand, lest the magic become too unwieldy. The numbers inscribed on the dice must be positive whole numbers, never greater than one hundred thousand, with each choice reflecting the guild\u2019s own philosophy.\n\nOne day, the Council posed a grand challenge to the people: from the N mighty dice of Polyhedria, choose any two, and cast them together. The goal is to determine, through clever selection, which pair of dice\u2014when rolled\u2014has the greatest chance of showing the same number on both dice. This is a matter of probability, governed strictly by the faces inscribed by each guild, and the random magic that ensures every face is equally likely to appear.\n\nTo participate in the challenge, a competitor must first declare the number of dice in the realm. Then, for each die, the competitor must describe its construction: first, the number of faces it bears, followed by a list of the numbers carved onto each face, in the order they appear. The Council\u2019s scribes will then consider all possible pairs of dice, and for each, they will calculate the likelihood that both dice, when rolled, will reveal an identical number. Among all these possibilities, the Council seeks the greatest such probability\u2014the optimal outcome that any pair of dice in Polyhedria can achieve.\n\nFor example, imagine a day at the council where three guilds bring forth their dice. The first die has three faces, numbered 1, 2, and 3; the second has four faces, bearing the numbers 1, 2, 2, and 1; the third is a classic die with six faces, numbered 1 through 6. When the Council considers the first and second dice, they find that the chance of both showing the same number is one in three\u2014the highest among all possible pairs, and so, the council proclaims the answer to be 0.333333333333333. In another gathering, if the first die has five faces, all marked with the number 1; the second die has four faces, each showing the number 2; and the third die has three faces, two with the number 1 and one with the number 2, the greatest chance for a matching roll is two in three, or 0.666666666666667, achieved by pairing the first and third dice.\n\nThus, the Council of Games invites all to test their luck and logic, to uncover which pair of dice in Polyhedria\u2019s treasury can most reliably echo each other\u2019s fate\u2014an eternal celebration of chance, strategy, and the elegant mathematics woven into the realm\u2019s enchanted dice.",

        "question_content": "In the storied land of Numeria, there exists an ancient ritual for constructing the Grand Parade of Numbers\u2014a ceremonial procession where each number, from the smallest to the largest, must take its place in a precise order. This order is not arbitrary, but dictated by the Council of Positions, a mysterious body that hands each number a unique scroll. On each scroll, a number is told at which spot, counting from the front of the parade, it must step in when its turn arrives. The procession begins with an empty plaza, and the numbers arrive one by one, each following the council\u2019s decree for their placement.\n\nThe council\u2019s rules are clear and strictly enforced. There may be as few as one or as many as five hundred thousand numbers invited to the parade, but each must receive a unique position scroll. When a number arrives, it is told to step into the parade such that, counting from the front, it becomes the exact position described on its scroll. If a number is told to be first, it boldly takes the lead, nudging the others back; if told to be second, it steps in just behind the leader, and so forth. No number may request a position deeper in the parade than the number of guests already present plus one\u2014thus, every scroll\u2019s instruction is always possible to follow.\n\nThe ritual begins with the council announcing the total number of guests, which is a single integer called the Number of Invitees. Next, the council unveils a sequence of scrolls, one for each number, each scroll specifying the desired position for its bearer at the moment of arrival. All scrolls are read in the order the numbers are meant to arrive. At the end of the ceremony, the council wishes to see the final arrangement of the parade, with each number\u2019s place called out in order from front to back.\n\nYour quest, as the Keeper of the Parade, is to orchestrate this procession according to the council\u2019s rules, ensuring every number takes its appointed place upon arrival, and to reveal the final line-up once all have entered. You must do this as efficiently as possible, for the council prizes not only correctness but also swiftness, given the grand scale of the event.\n\nTo receive your instructions, you will first be told the Number of Invitees. Then, on the second line, you will be handed the sequence of scrolls, each scroll\u2019s number indicating the position at which the corresponding number wishes to enter the parade. When your work is complete, you must announce the final arrangement of the parade as a row of numbers, separated by spaces, from front to back.\n\nLet us see how this ritual plays out with a few examples. Suppose the council declares four invitees and hands out scrolls reading: first, first, second, first. The parade forms as follows: the first number steps in front, then the second takes the lead, pushing the first behind, the third enters as second, and finally, the fourth claims the lead spot, shifting all others back. The final parade: fourth, second, third, first. In another case, with five invitees and scrolls reading: first, second, third, fourth, fifth, each number simply takes its place at the end, yielding a parade in perfect ascending order: first, second, third, fourth, fifth. Thus, the Grand Parade of Numbers is completed, and the council\u2019s will is fulfilled.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Numeria, there existed a council of wise sages known as the Triplet Guild. The Guild\u2019s sole purpose was to identify and celebrate \u201cfine triplets\u201d\u2014unique groupings of three citizens whose ages, when lined up in ascending order, exhibited a remarkable harmony: the difference between the youngest and the middle citizen matched precisely the difference between the middle and the eldest. This rare alignment, called the \u201cfine balance,\u201d was revered as a symbol of unity and mathematical beauty throughout the land.\n\nThe Guild\u2019s traditions were governed by several strict societal rules. Firstly, each triplet must consist of three different citizens, and no two could share the same age, as individuality was highly prized. Furthermore, the ages within each triplet had to rise strictly from youngest to eldest, with no equality or reversal allowed. Most importantly, the age gap between the youngest and the middle member always had to mirror that between the middle and the eldest\u2014this was the heart of the fine balance. The sages also imposed limits on the city\u2019s population: the number of candidates presented for consideration could be any whole number from one up to a million, and each age was always a positive whole number not exceeding a million. No age was ever repeated among the candidates.\n\nCitizens wishing to be considered would gather at the city square, where their ages were recorded for the Guild\u2019s review. The Guild would first note the total number of citizens assembled. Then, they would list each age in the order presented. This record-keeping was crucial, as it formed the basis for the Guild\u2019s deliberations. The sages\u2019 ultimate goal was to identify and count all possible fine triplets that could be formed from the given assembly, ensuring that every valid grouping was accounted for, and no opportunity for harmony went unnoticed.\n\nTo participate, the citizens provided their information in a specific manner: first, stating the total number of individuals gathered, followed by each of their ages in any sequence. The Guild\u2019s scribes would then announce a single number\u2014this was the tally of all fine triplets discovered among the crowd, reflecting the full extent of harmony present in that assembly.\n\nFor instance, on one occasion, five citizens aged 8, 3, 1, 5, and 2 gathered. The sages found three fine triplets among them: one group with ages 1, 2, and 3; another with 1, 3, and 5; and a third with 2, 5, and 8. On another day, seven citizens with ages 300,000; 100,000; 499,998; 499,999; 200,000; 400,000; and 500,000 assembled, and five fine triplets were uncovered. In yet another gathering of ten citizens aged 13, 1, 16, 15, 12, 4, 7, 10, 2, and 19, the Guild celebrated the discovery of ten fine triplets. Thus, the story of Numeria\u2019s Triplet Guild lives on, a testament to the pursuit of balance and the art of counting harmony in every assembly.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling port city of Marilune, oysters are more than just a delicacy\u2014they are the subject of legend, fortune, and, occasionally, peril. Among the oysterfolk, it is whispered that of the four grand oyster clans\u2014known simply as the First, Second, Third, and Fourth\u2014one harbors a hidden trait: it brings dire stomach woes to any who dare consume it. The city\u2019s wise council wishes to unmask this troublesome clan, for the safety and joy of all Marilune\u2019s diners.\n\nOne fateful evening, two renowned gourmands\u2014Sir Takahashi and Lord Aoki\u2014agreed to assist in this vital investigation. Each chose their oysters with care. Sir Takahashi, bold and methodical, tasted from the First and Second clans. Lord Aoki, ever adventurous, sampled the First and Third. Later, the city\u2019s doctors inquired after their well-being. The council recorded their responses as a pair of words: for each, either \u201csick\u201d if the evening ended in distress, or \u201cfine\u201d if all was well. These two words, in this order, form the sacred clue that will reveal the culprit oyster clan.\n\nThe council\u2019s task is clear: using only the records of who ate which oysters and whether each gourmand fell ill, deduce the number of the oyster clan responsible for the malaise. Of course, only one clan bears this curse, and the others are perfectly safe. The council must always choose with certainty, based on the evidence, the single clan that fits all the clues. To ensure swift communication, the answer must be announced as a single number\u2014either 1, 2, 3, or 4\u2014representing the guilty clan.\n\nIn Marilune\u2019s grand archives, the council\u2019s scribe records the clues as follows: first, the outcome for Sir Takahashi (\u201csick\u201d or \u201cfine\u201d), followed by a space, then the outcome for Lord Aoki (\u201csick\u201d or \u201cfine\u201d). For example, if Sir Takahashi was ill and Lord Aoki was well, the entry would read:  \n`sick fine`  \nThe council then proclaims a single number, on a line by itself, to reveal the offending oyster\u2019s clan.\n\nLet us consider two tales from the records. In the first, the entry reads \u201csick fine.\u201d Sir Takahashi, who ate from the First and Second clans, fell ill, but Lord Aoki, who ate from the First and Third, did not. The council deduced that the Second clan, sampled only by Sir Takahashi, must be responsible, and so the number \u201c2\u201d was declared.  \nIn another case, the entry reads \u201cfine fine.\u201d Neither gourmand suffered, suggesting that the accursed oyster was the Fourth clan, which neither tasted; thus, the council announced \u201c4.\u201d  \nThrough such careful reasoning, Marilune\u2019s people remain safe, and the legend of the oyster clans continues\u2014now with a little less risk at dinner.",

        "question_content": "Long ago, in the bustling city of Lexiconia, there existed a curious festival known as the Parade of Patterns. This festival drew crowds from all corners of the land, for its central spectacle was the unveiling of the Grand Banner\u2014an intricate tapestry woven with symbols, each one representing a tale from the city's rich history. The length of this banner, always between three and one hundred glyphs, was determined each year by the city\u2019s leading artisans, who worked only with the boldest uppercase runes.\n\nThe festival\u2019s greatest challenge, beloved by the keenest pattern-seekers, was the Quest of Even Echoes. Each year, the crowd was invited to seek out special sequences on the Grand Banner\u2014those in which the glyph of Aspiration, followed by the glyph of Bravery, and finally the glyph of Courage, appeared in that exact order, spaced evenly apart. Tradition dictated the following: the first chosen glyph must come before the second, which must come before the third; the distance from the first to the second must be precisely the same as from the second to the third. Only then would the sequence be deemed a True Echo.\n\nThe rules of the quest were clear and unyielding. The crowd was to find every possible trio of glyphs\u2014each trio chosen from the banner such that the first glyph was Aspiration, the second Bravery, and the third Courage, with each glyph appearing later than the last, and each spaced at equal intervals. Every such trio was to be counted, for the city prized not mere discovery, but completeness: the aim was to find as many True Echoes as the banner could possibly hold.\n\nTo begin the quest, the master of ceremonies would present the Grand Banner to all, reading its glyphs aloud in order. The parchment with the banner\u2019s sequence was passed to the crowd as a single line of runes. The challenge was then to call out the total number of True Echoes\u2014the count of all possible trios that fit the festival\u2019s legendary pattern. The answer, a single number, would be announced to great applause.\n\nConsider these moments from past festivals:  \nWhen the Grand Banner read \u201cAABCC,\u201d two True Echoes were found\u2014the first by tracing from the first Aspiration to the central Bravery and out to the far Courage, and the second by starting at the second Aspiration, passing through Bravery, and ending at the nearer Courage.  \nIn another year, the banner \u201cARC\u201d yielded no such sequences, to the crowd\u2019s slight disappointment.  \nYet when the banner was \u201cAABAAABBAEDCCCD,\u201d the seekers uncovered four True Echoes, their cheers echoing through the city.\n\nThus, the Parade of Patterns became not just a celebration of artistry, but a testament to the power of order, patience, and the thrill of a perfectly spaced tale.",

        "question_title": "Swap to Gather",
        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Bitonia, the Festival of Lights was about to begin. This city was famous for its grand parade, where lantern bearers\u2014each holding either a glowing lantern or an unlit one\u2014would line up along the Main Avenue. Every year, the Mayor would announce the sequence of lanterns, a string of glowing (\u201c1\u201d) and unlit (\u201c0\u201d) lanterns, stretching the length of the parade. This year, the parade had exactly N lantern bearers, and the Mayor had decreed that at least one lantern must be aglow, ensuring the festival\u2019s spirit remained alive.\n\nHowever, the ancient tradition demanded that all the glowing lanterns must march together, side by side, forming a single, dazzling cluster somewhere along the avenue. To achieve this, the parade organizers were allowed to instruct any two adjacent lantern bearers to swap places, but only one pair at a time, and only between neighbors. The organizers could do this as many times as they wished\u2014or not at all\u2014so long as the glowing lanterns ended up forming an unbroken line, with no unlit lanterns separating them. The rules were strict: only swaps between neighbors, and only those swaps that would eventually lead to a single, contiguous segment of glowing lanterns.\n\nThe challenge for the organizers was clear: **How few of these neighborly swaps could they perform to gather all the glowing lanterns together, regardless of where that cluster ended up along the avenue?** They wanted to be as efficient as possible, minimizing the amount of hustle and bustle before the parade began, for the festival\u2019s opening was eagerly awaited by all of Bitonia.\n\nTo help the organizers, the Mayor provided instructions for how to describe the lantern lineup and how to announce their solution. Each year, the organizers would receive two lines of input: the first was the number N, the length of the parade; the second was the sequence of lanterns, a string of N characters\u2014each either \u201c0\u201d for unlit or \u201c1\u201d for glowing\u2014describing the parade\u2019s initial lineup. When they announced their answer, they would simply state the minimum number of swaps needed as a single number.\n\nFor example, in one festival with seven lantern bearers and the lineup \u201c0101001\u201d, it took exactly three neighborly swaps to gather all the glowing lanterns together\u2014no fewer would suffice. In another, with just three lantern bearers in the \u201c100\u201d formation, the glowing lanterns were already together, so no swaps were required. In the grandest festival, with ten lantern bearers in the sequence \u201c0101001001\u201d, the organizers found that seven swaps would bring all the glowing lanterns into a single, radiant group.\n\nThus, the Festival of Lights in Bitonia became not just a celebration of brilliance, but also a testament to cleverness, as the organizers strove each year to unite the glowing lanterns with the fewest neighborly swaps, bringing joy and unity to the city\u2019s grand parade.",

It starts by counting the number of glowing lanterns and the number of unlit lanterns in the first `glowing` number of lanterns.

        "question_content": "In the distant land of Numeria, there existed a grand order known as the Guild of Divisors. This guild was renowned for its ancient tradition: every year, its members would gather to test their unity and strength through a ritual called the Gathering of Commonality. Each participant, known by a unique number, lined up in a sequence, their values representing their inner power. The ritual\u2019s purpose was to determine, for each guild member, the greatest strength they could achieve by forming a team of exactly K members, provided that they themselves were always included in their chosen team.\n\nThe rules of the Gathering were precise and unyielding, woven into the very fabric of Numeria\u2019s society. First, the number of participants in the sequence (let\u2019s call this N) could never exceed a sum as grand as one million and two hundred thousand, nor could it be less than one. The size of each team (denoted in the old tongue as K) was always at least one, and never greater than the number of participants present. Furthermore, each member\u2019s power was a positive integer, never surpassing a million. The elders insisted that all numbers be true and whole, for the ritual drew its magic from the purity of integers.\n\nAt the heart of the ritual was this challenge: for every guild member, imagine all possible teams of size K that included that very member. Among all such possible teams, the member sought the one whose collective essence\u2014measured by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of their powers\u2014was at its peak. The goal was not merely to assemble any team, but to find the team that would maximize their shared strength, considering all possible combinations that included themselves.\n\nTo participate, the Guild required aspirants to present their intentions in a specific manner. First, they would recite the number of members present (N) and the size of the teams to be formed (K) on a single line. The next line would reveal the sequence of each member\u2019s power, listed in order from the first to the N-th. Upon completion of the ritual, the Guild would announce, for each member in order, a single number on a new line: the greatest possible shared strength (the maximum GCD) they could reach as part of any eligible team that included themselves.\n\nLet us consider an example from the chronicles:  \nSuppose five members stood in line, and teams of two were to be formed. Their powers were three, four, six, seven, and twelve. For the first member, the optimal team would be themselves and the third member, yielding a shared strength of three. The second member would find their greatest bond with the fifth, reaching a strength of four. The third and fifth members could unite for a strength of six, while the fourth, not sharing factors with others, could only muster a strength of one. Thus, the Guild would declare the following sequence of strengths:  \n3  \n4  \n6  \n1  \n6\n\nIn another tale, three members each sought a team of three. With strengths of six, ten, and fifteen, no shared factor bound all three together more than one, and so each received the answer one. In a more complex gathering of ten, the outcomes varied, but the ritual\u2019s purpose remained clear: to guide each member to the greatest unity they could possibly achieve, without ever breaking the ancient laws of Numeria.\n\nAnd so, the Gathering of Commonality endures, its rules and rituals a testament to Numeria\u2019s pursuit of greatest shared strength. Each year, as new members join and ancient numbers are recited, the Guild reminds all that, in unity, the greatest power is found\u2014not in mere numbers, but in the harmony of their divisors.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling kingdom of Numeria, there lived a guild of archivists who maintained a legendary scroll, upon which was inscribed a line of enchanted numbers. The length of this scroll was N, and each number inscribed upon it held a unique magical significance. One day, the Grand Archivist summoned the junior scholars, for a challenge had been issued by the wise Oracle: they must answer Q riddles, each concerning the scroll\u2019s secrets.\n\nThe riddle\u2019s rules were precise, as dictated by the Oracle\u2019s ancient customs. For each query, the Oracle would present two numbers: the first, a position on the scroll\u2014no further than the Nth glyph; the second, a threshold value, a magical limit. The scholars were to examine only the portion of the scroll up to the specified position. From these glyphs, they could select a collection of numbers\u2014these did not need to be adjacent, but each chosen glyph must display a number strictly greater than the one chosen before it. Moreover, every glyph in their collection had to bear a number no greater than the Oracle\u2019s threshold. The Oracle demanded that the scholars always find the greatest possible number of glyphs that could be selected under these rules.\n\nThe challenge, however, was not without its boundaries. The scroll\u2019s length and the number of Oracle\u2019s queries were both carefully limited, never exceeding twice ten to the fifth power. Every number inscribed upon the scroll was a positive integer, but none greater than ten to the ninth power. Furthermore, for each riddle, the threshold offered by the Oracle would always be at least as great as the smallest number among the considered glyphs.\n\nTo communicate with the Oracle, the scholars would first present the scroll\u2019s length and the number of riddles. Next, they would recite the sequence of numbers as they appeared on the scroll. For each riddle, they would state the position upon the scroll and the threshold value. The Oracle expected a response for each riddle\u2014each answer on its own line\u2014declaring the greatest number of glyphs that could be gathered in an ever-increasing order, each not exceeding the threshold.\n\nFor example, when the scroll was inscribed with the numbers 2, 4, 1, 3, 3, and the Oracle posed three riddles\u2014first concerning only the first two glyphs with a threshold of five, then all five glyphs with a threshold of two, and finally all glyphs again but with a threshold of three\u2014the scholars responded: two, one, and two. In the first case, both glyphs could be chosen in order; in the second, only the smallest glyphs could be chosen; in the third, the best was to choose either two and three or one and three. Thus, the scholars\u2019 answers were:\n\n2  \n1  \n2  \n\nIn another scroll of length ten, with numbers 2, 5, 6, 5, 2, 1, 7, 9, 7, 2, the Oracle posed eight riddles, each specifying a position and a threshold. The scholars, after careful deliberation, provided their responses\u2014four, one, one, two, one, five, three, and four\u2014each corresponding to the greatest possible collection of glyphs as decreed by the Oracle\u2019s laws.\n\nSo the scholars of Numeria became masters of the Oracle\u2019s riddles, always striving to select the longest possible sequence of ever-increasing, magically limited glyphs, and thus preserved the wisdom of the scroll for generations to come.",

This parade is recorded as a great scroll, its length never less than one and never more than a hundred symbols. The scroll always features at least one citizen bearing the prestigious badge of the number two, for it is a revered tradition that the Parade never commences without their presence.\n\nBut on this particular Festival of Sorting, the Matron of Numeria has issued a decree: only the twos may remain in her sight. All other citizens\u2014those marked with any digit other than two\u2014must respectfully step aside, relinquishing their place in the parade. The twos, steadfast and proud, are to hold their positions, preserving the original sequence in which they appeared, forming a new, exclusive procession.\n\nYour task, as Numeria\u2019s trusted chronicler, is to read the parade\u2019s scroll, remove every digit except for the twos, and then transcribe the resulting parade of twos in the exact order they first appeared. The challenge is to do this as thoroughly as possible, never omitting a single two, and never disturbing their sequence.\n\n**Input Narrative:**  \nYou will receive, from the city\u2019s herald, a single line containing the parade\u2019s scroll\u2014a sequence of digits, with a length that can range from one to as many as a hundred. It is guaranteed that there is at least one two among them.\n\n**Output Narrative:**  \nYou are to inscribe, in the city\u2019s ledger, a single line: the exclusive parade of twos, written in the order they appeared in the original scroll. No other digits may appear in this inscription.\n\n**Let us consider some festival records:**  \n- When the parade scroll reads \u201c20250222\u201d, your inscription should be \u201c22222\u201d, for only the twos remain after the Matron\u2019s decree, and they must be written in their original sequence.\n- If the scroll simply displays \u201c2\u201d, then your inscription must be \u201c2\u201d.\n- Should you be handed a scroll such as \u201c22222000111222222\u201d, your inscription will be \u201c22222222222\u201d, faithfully recording every two in the order of their march.\n\nThus, by the Matron\u2019s command, ensure that only the twos are inscribed\u2014no other digit may share their parade, and the order of their steps must remain unchanged.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling realm of Lexicoria, there existed a peculiar tradition among the Wordsmiths\u2014a guild famed for their artistry in weaving letters into magical tapestries. Each year, the guild held a ceremony called the Stringweave, where every apprentice would present a ribbon: a strip of fabric embroidered with a unique arrangement of lowercase runes. The headmistress, known as the Keeper of Lengths, insisted that no two ribbons could share the same measure, for diversity was the soul of their craft.\n\nOn the day of the Stringweave, the Keeper gathered all the apprentices in the grand hall. She announced the rules, as was customary: \u201cEvery apprentice shall present exactly one ribbon, and the number of apprentices gathered today shall be no fewer than two and no greater than half a hundred. Each ribbon must bear only the simplest runes\u2014no uppercase, no numbers, no symbols\u2014and its length must be at least a single rune, but may stretch to no more than fifty. And remember: no two ribbons may be of equal length, for such sameness would unravel the ceremony\u2019s magic.\u201d\n\nThe challenge of the day was clear. The Keeper declared, \u201cYour task is to honor the tradition as fully as possible: Arrange all your ribbons side by side, but do so not by color, nor by pattern, but by their very length\u2014from the shortest to the longest. Once arranged, the runes from each ribbon shall be read in order, seamlessly, to create a single, unbroken incantation. This incantation will be the symbol of our unity and diversity.\u201d\n\nTo participate, each apprentice would step forward and announce their name (in this case, the number of apprentices), followed by the unveiling of each ribbon, one after another. Thus, the ceremony\u2019s formal input would be: first, a single number to represent how many apprentices (and thus, ribbons) there were, and then, the list of ribbon runes, each on its own line. The Keeper, having heard and seen all, would then recite the final incantation\u2014the single string that emerged from joining the ribbons in order of their lengths.\n\nFor example, consider one year when three apprentices offered their ribbons: \u201ctc,\u201d \u201coder,\u201d and \u201ca.\u201d The Keeper, by tradition, arranged them as \u201ca,\u201d \u201ctc,\u201d and \u201coder,\u201d and the resulting incantation was pronounced: \u201catcoder.\u201d On another occasion, with four apprentices presenting \u201ccat,\u201d \u201cenate,\u201d \u201con,\u201d and \u201cc,\u201d the proper order became \u201cc,\u201d \u201con,\u201d \u201ccat,\u201d and \u201cenate,\u201d yielding the grand word: \u201cconcatenate.\u201d\n\nThus, the Stringweave became a living puzzle\u2014one of order, uniqueness, and harmony\u2014where the magic lay not just in the runes chosen, but in the meticulous arrangement decreed by the Keeper of Lengths.",

        "question_content": "In the sprawling city of Lexiconia, the citizens communicate through a grand tapestry known as the String\u2014a magical sequence of banners, each inscribed with a single capital letter. On festival days, the String is hung from the highest towers, and its order is of great importance to the city\u2019s harmony. But there is a peculiar superstition among the people: whenever the sequence \"W\" followed directly by \"A\" appears anywhere in the String, it is considered a sign of discord and must be remedied at once.\n\nThe ancient council decreed a strict rule: whenever the troublesome \"W\" and \"A\" stand together, the first such occurrence from the left must be transformed into \"A\" followed by \"C\"\u2014a symbol of Accord and Cooperation. This ritual is repeated as long as the String contains any such discordant pairs. Only the leftmost such pair is ever addressed at each step, ensuring that the process unfolds in a consistent, orderly fashion. The council assures all that, no matter how long the String may be\u2014so long as it does not exceed N banners in length, where N is a grand number, possibly reaching three times ten to the fifth power\u2014the ritual will always reach a harmonious conclusion after a finite number of steps.\n\nWhen a festival approaches, the High Scribe receives a parchment containing the current arrangement of banners\u2014a single line of uppercase letters, up to N in length. The scribe\u2019s duty is to perform the ritual, step by step, always seeking and mending the leftmost \"W\" and \"A\" pair until no such discord remains. The final, harmonious String is then displayed proudly for all to see.\n\n**Input Format in the World of Lexiconia:**  \nThe High Scribe is handed a single line, the String, written in uppercase letters. The length of this String, as decreed, is at least one and no more than N banners.\n\n**Output Format in the World of Lexiconia:**  \nAfter performing the ritual as described, the scribe must inscribe and present the final harmonious String\u2014now free of any \"W\" and \"A\" pairs\u2014on a new parchment for the city\u2019s celebration.\n\nLet us look at some chronicles from Lexiconia\u2019s archives:\n\n- In one festival, the String began as \"WACWA\". The scribe found two discordant pairs: first at the beginning, then near the end. The scribe first transformed the leftmost pair into \"AC\", yielding \"ACCWA\". Finding another discordant pair, the scribe again transformed it, resulting in \"ACCAC\". The city displayed \"ACCAC\" with pride, as harmony had been restored.\n\n- In another tale, the String was \"WWA\". Here, the scribe noticed a \"W\" and \"A\" at the end. Transforming it gave \"WAC\". But a new discordant pair appeared, now starting at the first banner. The scribe repeated the ritual, and finally, \"ACC\" adorned the towers, free of discord.\n\n- Yet, sometimes, as in the case where the String read \"WWWWW\", no such discord ever existed. The scribe found no pairs to mend, and the String remained untouched, displayed as \"WWWWW\" with no further ceremony.\n\nThus, it is through this time-honored ritual that Lexiconia preserves the order of its banners, always seeking the most harmonious arrangement possible, and always following the sacred rule: mend the leftmost discord, until none remain.",

        "question_content": "In the kingdom of Chromatica, artisans communicated through intricate ribbons woven with six distinct hues\u2014each representing a different bracket: the gentle curve of dawn\u2019s pink (( and )), the bold blue of midday ([ and ]), and the shimmering gold of twilight (< and >). These ribbons, when woven in a precise balance, formed what the Chromaticians called a \"colorful sequence\": a tapestry so harmonious that, if one carefully unraveled matching colored pairs, the ribbon would disappear entirely, leaving no trace behind.\n\nThe Chromaticians adhered to strict rules in their weaving. Only three pairings were recognized as truly harmonious: dawn pink must embrace itself (( and )), midday blue must mirror itself ([ and ]), and twilight gold must face itself (< and >). Furthermore, only pairs that lay side by side could be unraveled at each step. Once a pair was removed, the remaining segments would join seamlessly, as if the missing pair had never existed. The process could be repeated, as many times as needed, until the ribbon was either entirely gone or no further unraveling was possible.\n\nThe Grand Weaver now poses a challenge: given any ribbon of length between one and twice ten raised to the fifth power, crafted only from the six sacred hues, can you determine if it forms a truly colorful sequence? In other words, is it possible, by repeatedly unraveling only adjacent matching pairs, to make the ribbon vanish completely? The answer must be swift and precise\u2014\u201cYes\u201d if the ribbon can be fully unraveled, \u201cNo\u201d if even a single knot remains.\n\nTo participate in this challenge, each artisan presents their ribbon as a single line of symbols, each symbol representing one hue. The Grand Weaver then inspects the ribbon and responds with a single word on a new line: \u201cYes\u201d if the ribbon\u2019s colors dissolve in perfect harmony, \u201cNo\u201d if discordant knots remain.\n\nLet us consider a few tales from the archives:\n- In one contest, an artisan submitted a ribbon woven as ([])<>(). The Grand Weaver watched as the artisan unraveled blue from blue, then pink from pink, then gold from gold, and finally pink from pink again\u2014leaving nothing behind. The answer was \u201cYes.\u201d\n- Another artisan, bolder but less careful, presented ([<)]>. Here, no matter how the Grand Weaver tried, no harmonious pairs lay side by side to unravel, and knots remained. The answer was \u201cNo.\u201d\n- In a third trial, a ribbon of ()) was brought forth. The Grand Weaver saw that, after a single unraveling, a knot remained that could not be undone. The answer was \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThus, in the kingdom of Chromatica, only those who master the art of harmonious pairing can weave a ribbon that disappears entirely\u2014a truly colorful bracket sequence.",

        "question_title": "Palindromic Shortest Path",
        "question_content": "Certainly! Here is the coding problem transformed into a narrative story, following your guidelines and structure:\n\n---\n\nIn the ancient city of Palindoria, there stood a grand palace with N mystical chambers, each numbered in the ancient tongue from the first to the Nth. The palace was renowned for its enigmatic passageways\u2014some adorned with magical glyphs, others sealed shut with impenetrable wards. The palace\u2019s legend spoke of a challenge: to traverse from any chamber to any other, treading paths such that the sequence of glyphs encountered would read the same forwards and backwards\u2014a perfect palindrome, the emblem of harmony in Palindoria.\n\nThe palace\u2019s blueprints were curious: for each chamber, a row of N symbols described the passages to all other chambers. If a symbol was a lowercase letter, it meant a secret passage led from one chamber to another, marked by that glyph. If the symbol was a dash, no such passage existed. The blueprints formed a square, N by N, each row and column corresponding to one chamber. The city\u2019s scholars inscribed this information meticulously: beginning with the number of chambers, then, for each chamber, listing N symbols in order\u2014each row on its own line.\n\nThe Queen of Palindoria, fascinated by symmetry, posed a challenge to her council. For every possible pair of chambers\u2014consider the first as the starting point and the second as the destination\u2014she wished to know: what is the fewest number of passageways one must cross to journey from the first to the second, so that the glyphs along the way (read in order) form a palindrome? If no such harmonious journey exists, the answer should be the sacred number of impossibility: minus one. Note, a journey that does not require any passage at all (remaining in the same chamber) is considered perfectly palindromic, as the empty sequence of glyphs is revered as the purest form.\n\nThe council is to present their answers to the Queen in a grand mosaic: for every chamber, a row of N answers, each separated by a space, with each row on its own line\u2014mirroring the palace\u2019s blueprints. Thus, the council\u2019s solution must be a tapestry of N rows, each with N numbers, where the number in the ith row and jth column represents the shortest harmonious journey from chamber i to chamber j.\n\nThe city\u2019s laws impose strict boundaries: the palace must contain at least one chamber, but never more than a hundred. The blueprints must obey their ancient format. The council is to use the knowledge of passageways as described, and answer for every pair of chambers: what is the minimum number of passages needed to achieve palindromic harmony, or declare the journey impossible with minus one.\n\nFor example, consider a palace of four chambers, with blueprints as follows:\n```\n4\nab--\n--b-\n---a\nc---\n```\nThe council\u2019s answer would be:\n```\n0 1 2 4\n-1 0 1 -1\n3 -1 0 1\n1 -1 -1 0\n```\nHere, for instance, to journey from the first to the fourth chamber, the shortest harmonious path is through chambers 1 \u2192 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 4, following the glyphs a, b, b, a, forming \u201cabba\u201d\u2014a perfect palindrome. No shorter harmonious journey exists.\n\nIn another case, a palace of five chambers with blueprints:\n```\n5\nus---\n-st--\n--s--\nu--s-\n---ts\n```\nThe council\u2019s answer is:\n```\n0 1 3 -1 -1\n-1 0 1 -1 -1\n-1 -1 0 -1 -1\n1 3 -1 0 -1\n-1 -1 5 1 0\n```\nHere, the council demonstrates, for every pair of chambers, the shortest journey of palindromic harmony\u2014should such a path exist\u2014or declares it impossible, as demanded by the Queen\u2019s challenge.",

        "question_content": "In the distant realm of Carbohn, the alchemists of the Kingdom of Bonds have long studied the mystical \u201calkane\u201d structures that form the backbone of their magical forests. These forests are made up of enchanted trees, each with a number of branching points\u2014some are simple leaves, others are mighty trunks with four strong limbs. Every tree in Carbohn is mapped with N magical nodes, each connected by enchanted pathways. The map is always a true tree: a single, living network with no loops, where every node is connected through exactly one unique route.\n\nThe alchemists have strict rules for what they call a \u201ctrue alkane\u201d grove. First, the grove itself must be a tree\u2014no mysterious cycles or disconnected patches. Second, every magical node within this grove must be either a humble leaf (with exactly one connection) or a grand nexus with precisely four connections. Importantly, the grove must have at least one such nexus; a grove of only leaves is too fragile to bear the title of alkane.\n\nThe challenge for the alchemists is thus: Given the grand map of the Kingdom\u2019s enchanted tree, can you find within it a sub-grove\u2014a connected and cycle-free subset\u2014that satisfies the alkane rules? And if there are many possible choices, which sub-grove can be made as large as possible?\n\nTo consult the ancient scrolls, an alchemist must provide the map in a standard form: the first line reveals the number of magical nodes, N. The next N-1 lines record the enchanted pathways, each line listing the two nodes joined by a single pathway. The answer, when discovered, is a single number: the greatest possible number of nodes in any alkane grove within the given tree, or -1 if no such grove can be conjured.\n\nLet us consider the scrolls of past alchemists. In one tale, the map of nine nodes and eight pathways (1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 2-6, 2-7, 3-8, 3-9) yielded a grand alkane grove of size eight, as the alchemist cleverly omitted a single node to shape the perfect structure. In another, a smaller map of seven nodes (1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 2-5, 3-6, 3-7) offered no possible alkane grove, and the answer was -1\u2014a lesson in humility for the would-be conjurer. In a more complex forest of fifteen nodes, a wise alchemist found a maximal alkane grove of size eleven, skillfully choosing the right nexus points and leaves.\n\nThus, the alchemists of Carbohn invite you: Examine the grand map, heed the rules of the alkane, and reveal either the size of the largest possible alkane grove, or admit defeat with -1. May your reasoning be as sharp as the enchanted branches themselves!",

The program first reads the number of nodes and edges from stdin. It then builds a graph from the edges. The graph is represented as an adjacency list using a defaultdict of lists. The dfs function is used to traverse the graph and find the size of the largest possible alkane grove. If a node is a nexus, it subtracts 1 from the nexus count.

        "question_title": "Dense Buildings",
        "question_content": "In the bustling floating metropolis known as Skygrid, every block of the city is a towering structure, each building reaching a different number of floors into the clouds. The metropolis stretches in a perfect grid, with N rows running from the frigid north to the balmy south, and M columns from the misty west to the gilded east. Each block, identified by its row and column, holds a single building, and every building is unique in its height, some scraping the sky with over a million floors, others much more modest.\n\nIn this city lives Takahashi, an intrepid courier. His daily life is a dance of vertical and horizontal movement, navigating the intricate web of buildings and skywalks. Takahashi\u2019s journey through Skygrid follows a strict code: within any building, he can ascend or descend a single floor at a time by using the ancient, creaking staircases. But if he wishes to cross to an adjacent block\u2014north, south, east, or west\u2014he may only do so by stepping onto a transparent skywalk that connects buildings at matching heights. These skywalks are only accessible if both buildings have at least as many floors as the one Takahashi is standing on, and the move always places him on the very same floor in the new building. No shortcuts: the only way to change floors is by climbing or descending the stairs, one floor at a time.\n\nThe city council, eager to optimize Takahashi\u2019s routes, has given you a peculiar task. For each of Q missions, you are told where Takahashi starts\u2014on a specific floor in a specific building\u2014and where he must end up\u2014on another floor in another building. Your challenge is to determine the smallest possible number of times Takahashi must use the stairs during his journey, taking any path he likes, so long as he follows the city's rules. The number of times he uses the skywalks is not important to the council, only the total number of stair steps he must take between floors.\n\nTo help you, the council provides the city\u2019s blueprints and the missions in a precise manner. First, you will be told the dimensions of Skygrid: N (the number of north-south city blocks) and M (the number of west-east city blocks). Then, for each block, you will receive a list of the building heights, row by row from north to south, each listing M numbers for the heights in that row. After this, the council will announce Q, the number of missions. Each mission is described by six numbers: the starting block\u2019s row and column, the starting floor, the target block\u2019s row and column, and the target floor. The council expects you to report the answer for each mission\u2014one number per line, representing the minimum number of stair uses Takahashi must make.\n\nFor example, consider a small district of Skygrid with three rows and three columns, and building heights as follows:\n\n```\n3 3\n12 10 6\n1 1 3\n8 6 7\n2\n1 1 10 3 1 6\n1 1 6 1 2 4\n```\n\nFor the first mission, Takahashi can traverse the city using skywalks and stairs for a total of 10 stair moves, following a route that cleverly minimizes his stair usage, even if it means a longer path in terms of skywalks. For the second mission, he can reach his destination with just 2 stair moves, by using a skywalk to a neighboring building and then descending the stairs to reach the desired floor. \n\nThus, your answers for these missions would be:\n\n```\n10\n2\n```\n\nSo, in the world of Skygrid, your goal is always to help Takahashi find the most stair-efficient path from his starting place to his goal, using the city\u2019s interconnected heights and walkways to their fullest advantage.",

It reads the input from stdin, solves the problem, and writes the output to stdout. The input is read using the `read_input` function, and the solution is found using the `solve` function.

        "question_title": "Strictly Increasing?",
        "question_content": "In the ancient land of Numeria, the wise Queen Numerata presided over a kingdom famed for its grand processions. Whenever a new generation of hopefuls sought to join the royal order, they lined up before the palace gates, each proudly proclaiming their own number\u2014a symbol of their personal achievement and potential. The Queen, ever discerning, sought only those whose ambition soared higher than their peers, demanding that each successor in the line had accomplished more than the last.\n\nThe traditions in Numeria were clear: every procession must consist of at least two and no more than one hundred hopefuls, each bearing a badge with a whole number between one and one thousand. The Queen\u2019s decree was strict\u2014there could be no stagnation, no equal standing, and certainly no regression. Each badge in the procession must bear a number greater than the one before it, a sign that every hopeful surpassed their immediate predecessor. Only then would the Queen allow their entry into the royal order.\n\nIt became the custom for those wishing to join the order to present themselves in this fashion: first, they would announce the total number of hopefuls in their line, and then, in sequence, they would recite the numbers on their badges. An observer, acting as the Queen\u2019s scribe, would listen to this announcement and judge whether the line satisfied the Queen\u2019s standard\u2014whether each badge was strictly greater than the last. If the line met her expectations, the scribe would respond with an affirmative \u201cYes\u201d; if any faltered, the answer would be a resolute \u201cNo.\u201d The Queen, gracious in her wisdom, accepted any manner of \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d regardless of the tone or case.\n\nTo clarify these traditions, let us consider a few examples from Numerian history. On one occasion, a line of three hopefuls arrived, bearing the numbers one, two, and five. As each badge was greater than the previous, the scribe joyfully declared, \u201cYes,\u201d and the procession was welcomed. Another time, three hopefuls came forth with badges three, nine, and five. Though the second badge surpassed the first, the third fell short of the second, prompting the scribe to announce, \u201cNo,\u201d for the procession had faltered in ambition. In yet another case, a long line of ten hopefuls arrived, beginning with two badges both marked with the number one. Since the second badge did not exceed the first, the scribe immediately declared, \u201cNo,\u201d and the line was turned away.\n\nThus, the legacy of Numeria endures: only those who can demonstrate a perfectly ascending procession of ambition may join the Queen\u2019s order. The rules are simple, but the challenge is eternal\u2014can you, too, judge the worthiness of a Numerian procession?",

        "question_content": "In the heart of the ancient city of Gridoria, there stood a legendary Hall of Mirrors, famed not only for its beauty but also for its ever-changing floor. Each year, the architects of Gridoria would gather to lay down a new mosaic, the pattern determined by a sacred number, known in their tongue as N. This number, always a positive integer, dictated the size of the grand chamber: the floor would be built as a perfect square, N tiles wide and N tiles long.\n\nThe process of creating the pattern was steeped in tradition. At the break of dawn, the architects would approach the floor layer by layer, beginning at the outermost edge and working inward. On each round, they would select a square region, starting from tile (i, i) at the northwest corner to tile (j, j) at the southeast, where j was always calculated as one more than the width of the floor minus i. If the round number\u2014the value of i\u2014was not greater than j, the architects would fill this region: an odd-numbered round demanded the use of obsidian-black stones, while an even-numbered round called for gleaming white marble. Once a layer was set, it could be paved over in subsequent rounds, but only the latest stone would remain visible.\n\nThe city\u2019s scholars codified these rituals with the following decree:  \n- The master builder would announce the size of the floor (the number N), a single integer, spoken aloud at the start of the ceremony.  \n- Once the architects had finished, the city\u2019s chronicler would record the final appearance of the floor. For each row, a line would be inscribed: use a sharp mark (#) for every black stone, and a gentle dot (.) for every white marble. The chronicler\u2019s tablet would thus contain N lines, each with N symbols, faithfully representing the grid from top to bottom.\n\nAs the architects worked, they followed strict guidelines:  \n- The sacred number N could be any integer between one and fifty, inclusive.  \n- Every instruction was to be followed precisely, and the final pattern must leave no tile unadorned.  \n- The pattern should be completed as efficiently as possible, with each layer overwriting whatever came before, until the mosaic was finished.\n\nTo better understand the tradition, the chronicler kept records of past ceremonies. For example, when the sacred number was eleven, the resulting mosaic looked like this:\n\n###########\n#.........#\n#.#######.#\n#.#.....#.#\n#.#.###.#.#\n#.#.#.#.#.#\n#.#.###.#.#\n#.#.....#.#\n#.#######.#\n#.........#\n###########\n\nIf the sacred number was five, the mosaic would appear thus:\n\n#####\n#...#\n#.#.#\n#...#\n#####\n\nAnd for a number such as eight, the floor would shine as follows:\n\n########\n#......#\n#.####.#\n#.#..#.#\n#.#..#.#\n#.####.#\n#......#\n########\n\nFinally, for the smallest ceremonies\u2014when the number was two\u2014the architects would simply lay down:\n\n##\n##\n\nIn this way, the Hall of Mirrors continued to dazzle, its patterns forever changing, each one a testament to the architects\u2019 logic and the city\u2019s love for orderly beauty.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Numeria, the Council of Patterns governed the laws of sequences. Each year, the Council would present a tapestry\u2014woven with colored beads, each bead inscribed with a number. The tapestry was always exactly N beads long, with the colors and numbers of these beads recorded in the grand archives. The bead numbers ranged from the humblest single to the illustrious millionth, and the length of the tapestry could be anywhere from one bead up to two hundred thousand (that is, N could be as large as 2 \u00d7 10^5).\n\nThe Council\u2019s challenge for the year was a riddle of repetition: Seek within the tapestry any continuous stretch, no matter how short but never empty, that contains at least two beads bearing the same number. The twist of Numerian tradition was that this number must appear more than once somewhere in the whole tapestry, but the Council insisted that only stretches where this repetition was visible would be considered. The question was: what is the length of the shortest such stretch? If no such stretch existed\u2014if every bead\u2019s number was unique in every possible window\u2014the Council would declare the answer to be \u201c-1,\u201d a sign that the tapestry was woven with perfect variety.\n\nTo join the challenge, a Numerian would step forward and announce the length of the tapestry, N, followed by the sequence of bead numbers in order, separated by spaces. The Council would listen, then, after deliberation, reveal a single number: either the smallest length of a contiguous stretch where a number repeated, or \u201c-1\u201d if the tapestry was unblemished by repetition.\n\nThe rules, inscribed on the Council\u2019s pillars, were strict: the tapestry\u2019s length, N, must be at least one and at most two hundred thousand; every bead\u2019s number must be a positive integer between one and one million, and all numbers must be whole. Only these tapestries would be accepted for the challenge.\n\nFor example, when a tapestry of five beads was presented as \u201c5\u201d on one line, followed by \u201c3 9 5 3 1\u201d on the next, the Council found that the shortest stretch containing a repeated number was four beads long\u2014spanning from the first \u201c3\u201d to the second. Thus, they announced \u201c4.\u201d Another tapestry of four beads, \u201c4\u201d and \u201c2 5 3 1,\u201d was utterly unique in every stretch, so the Council solemnly declared \u201c-1.\u201d When a tapestry of ten beads began and ended with the same number\u2014\u201c10\u201d and \u201c1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55\u201d\u2014the Council spotted the repetition immediately, and the shortest such stretch was just two beads long, so they proclaimed \u201c2.\u201d\n\nThus, the Council of Patterns continued their age-old tradition, always seeking the shortest path to repetition, and rewarding those who could uncover it with wisdom and honor.",

        "question_title": "Flip Edge",
        "question_content": "In the ancient land of Verdantia, a kingdom of sprawling cities and winding roads, there existed a peculiar system of travel. The land was divided into N great cities, each a hub of commerce and intrigue. Between these cities stretched M mystical roads, each enchanted to only allow travel in a single direction\u2014some leading from one city to another, but never the reverse unless by extraordinary means. The wise sages of Verdantia, ever fond of order, numbered the cities from the first to the N-th, with the capital always being city number one and the distant frontier outpost as city number N.\n\nThe laws of Verdantia dictated that a traveler, starting at the capital, could journey to the outpost by walking along these enchanted roads. Each step from one city to another, using a road in its designated direction, would cost the traveler a single gold coin. However, there existed a rare and costly ritual: at any moment, the traveler could invoke the Rite of Reversal, which would magically reverse the direction of every road in the kingdom. This spell, however, came at a steep price\u2014requiring X gold coins each time it was cast. After the reversal, all roads could only be traversed in their new directions until, perhaps, the spell was performed again.\n\nYour quest, dear adventurer, is to determine the least amount of gold coins you must spend to journey from the capital to the farthest outpost, using any combination of steps along the roads or invocations of the Rite of Reversal. You must use the rules of Verdantia wisely, choosing the most efficient path and minimizing your expenditure, for the kingdom values frugality as much as bravery.\n\nTo embark upon your journey, the sages will present you with a scroll containing the following information: the number of cities, the number of roads, and the cost of the Rite of Reversal. Following this, each road will be listed as a pair of city numbers, describing the direction in which the road may be traveled. When you have determined the minimum gold required to reach the outpost, you must inscribe this number upon a tablet as proof of your cunning.\n\n**Input Format in Verdantia:**\n\n- The first line of the scroll contains three numbers: the count of cities (N), the count of roads (M), and the cost of the Rite of Reversal (X).\n- The next M lines each describe a road, with two numbers indicating a road from one city to another.\n\n**Output Format in Verdantia:**\n\n- Upon your return, present a single number: the minimum gold coins needed to reach the frontier outpost from the capital.\n\n**Constraints of the Kingdom:**\n- The kingdom has at least two cities and at most twice one hundred thousand.\n- The number of roads is at least one and at most twice one hundred thousand.\n- The Rite of Reversal costs at least one and at most one billion gold coins.\n- Each road connects two valid cities.\n- The sages assure that a path always exists from the capital to the outpost, no matter the roads or reversals.\n\n**Examples from the Chronicles of Verdantia:**\n\n*First Chronicle:*  \nSuppose there are five cities, six roads, and the Rite of Reversal costs five coins. The roads are as follows: from the capital to the second city, from the second to the fourth, from the third to the capital, from the third to the outpost, from the fourth to the third, and from the outpost to the second. The minimum cost to reach the outpost is four coins, by traveling through the second, fourth, third, and finally the outpost.\n\n*Second Chronicle:*  \nIf the same roads exist, but the Rite of Reversal is cheaper\u2014just one coin\u2014the traveler can cleverly reverse the roads after reaching the second city, then proceed directly to the outpost, spending only three coins in total.\n\n*Third Chronicle:*  \nIn a tale of eight cities, seven roads, and an exorbitant reversal cost of six hundred thirteen million five hundred sixty-six thousand seven hundred fifty-six coins, the traveler must weigh their options carefully. The journey, in this case, requires over four billion coins, showing that sometimes the Rite of Reversal is best avoided.\n\n*Fourth Chronicle:*  \nIn a larger kingdom of twenty cities and thirteen roads, with a reversal costing five coins, the cleverest path to the outpost can be traversed for twenty-one gold coins.\n\nThus, with wisdom, cunning, and a careful reading of the enchanted scroll, you too can become a legend of Verdantia, known for crossing the land with the least expense!",

The heap is initialized with the capital (node 1) and the cost is 0. The program then enters a loop where it pops the node with the smallest cost from the heap, marks it as visited, and adds its cost to the total cost.

        "question_content": "In the bustling kingdom of Orthodontia, every citizen\u2019s social standing depends on the harmony of their twin rows of ceremonial teeth\u2014an ancient tradition passed down through generations. Each noble is born with a matched set: a row of upper pearls and a row of lower ivories, each containing the same number, N, of teeth. The length of every upper tooth and its corresponding lower counterpart is a matter of great pride, and the kingdom\u2019s Grand Ball approaches\u2014a time when the perfect fit of one\u2019s teeth is judged most stringently.\n\nThe Council of Alignment has decreed that a noble\u2019s teeth are considered to \"fit together well\" only if two sacred conditions are met. First, for each matching pair from leftmost to rightmost, the combined length of the upper and lower tooth must be identical across the entire mouth\u2014a secret sum, H, known only to the Oracle of Symmetry. Second, the difference in length between any two adjacent upper teeth must never exceed the kingdom\u2019s tolerance limit, X, lest the smile appear jagged and unrefined. These rules are enforced with the utmost seriousness, as only the most harmonious mouths are allowed to grace the royal festivities.\n\nTo aid in their quest for perfection, the nobles have access to a magical tooth-grinding machine, found in the bustling market square. For the price of one gleaming yen, the machine will shave a single unit of length from any tooth whose length is still positive. The nobles may use this contraption as often as they wish, but only by reducing, never increasing, the length of a tooth. Thus, the challenge is to achieve the Council\u2019s standards while spending as little gold as possible\u2014a true test of both thrift and taste.\n\nWhen a noble seeks guidance, they must present their details in a prescribed manner to the royal record-keeper: first, the number of teeth in each row, N, and the kingdom\u2019s tolerance, X. Next, for each tooth position from left to right, the length of the upper tooth followed by the length of the lower tooth\u2014each pair on its own line. In return, the Oracle will pronounce the minimum sum of yen required to achieve a harmonious fit, or declare the mouth perfect as is, requiring no further expense.\n\nConsider the case of Sir Takahashi, who presents the following arrangement to the Oracle:\n\n4 3  \n3 1  \n4 1  \n5 9  \n2 6  \n\nThe Oracle\u2019s wisdom reveals that Sir Takahashi must spend 15 yen to attain perfection\u2014no less will suffice. In another case, a noble whose teeth are already in flawless alignment pays nothing at all, while in dire circumstances, the cost may soar to the stratosphere, as with a set of colossal teeth requiring thousands of units to be ground away.\n\nThus, through the laws of Orthodontia, the nobles must heed the precise instructions and strive for harmony, reporting their input as described and interpreting the Oracle\u2019s answer as the minimum gold needed for a smile fit for the Grand Ball. The fate of their social standing\u2014and the glory of their grin\u2014rests in the balance.",

        "question_content": "Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Numeria, there was an ancient tradition among the Guild of Beadstringers. Every year, the guild would host a competition to craft the most harmonious and aesthetically pleasing beadstrings. Each beadstring was a sequence of colored beads, and the number of beads in a string was always a number between three and one hundred, never more and never less. The colors themselves were chosen from a palette of one hundred vibrant hues, each represented by a unique number from one to one hundred.\n\nIn the world of beadstringing, a curious rule governed the contest: the Council of Patterns forbade any beadstring from having a \u201cTriad Echo.\u201d A Triad Echo occurred if, at any place along the string, three or more beads of the same color sat together in a row. Such repetition was thought to disrupt the flow of harmony, and any string displaying this pattern was immediately disqualified. The council instructed all participants to scrutinize their creations: starting from the first bead and moving along, if they ever found a spot where three consecutive beads were of identical color, they must declare their string as \u201cDisharmonious.\u201d Otherwise, the string could be celebrated as \u201cHarmonious.\u201d\n\nTo participate, each beadstringer would step before the council and recite their entry. First, they would declare the total number of beads in their string\u2014let\u2019s call this number N, which could be any value from three up to one hundred. Next, they would announce the sequence of bead colors, one by one, in the order they appeared on the string. The council recorded these numbers as the official representation of the beadstring.\n\nThe council\u2019s judgment was simple: if a Triad Echo existed anywhere along the string, they would announce \u201cYes,\u201d signifying the presence of disharmony. If not, they would respond with a resounding \u201cNo,\u201d celebrating the beadstring\u2019s purity. The council expected the beadstringers to seek out any Triad Echoes with utmost diligence and report their findings as efficiently as possible.\n\nTo illustrate, let us consider some entries from recent competitions:\n\n- One beadstringer presented a string of five beads: \u201c1 4 4 4 2.\u201d The council saw that beads two, three, and four all bore the color four. This was a Triad Echo, and the council declared \u201cYes.\u201d\n- Another offered a string of six beads: \u201c2 4 4 2 2 4.\u201d No three consecutive beads shared the same color, so the council replied \u201cNo.\u201d\n- A string of eight beads, \u201c1 4 2 5 7 7 7 2,\u201d contained a hidden Triad Echo at positions five, six, and seven, all colored seven. The judgment was \u201cYes.\u201d\n- Yet another, with ten distinct colors in a row, \u201c1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10,\u201d was declared \u201cNo.\u201d\n- Finally, a beadstring of thirteen beads, every one the same color: \u201c1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.\u201d Clearly, many Triad Echoes existed, and the council proclaimed \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nAnd so, through the language of colors and the search for harmony, the Guild of Beadstringers continued their timeless tradition, ever vigilant against the discord of the Triad Echo.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Numeria, the Grand Archivists maintained a peculiar ritual to safeguard their records. Deep within their marble halls stood a sacred tower of memory: a stack of exactly one hundred parchment cards, each marked with the number zero\u2014a symbol of a fresh beginning. The Archivists, revered for their orderliness, followed strict customs whenever they wished to alter this tower, ensuring that every change was recorded and nothing was ever lost.\n\nWhenever an Archivist approached the tower, they could perform one of two sacred acts. The first, known as the Rite of Inscription, allowed them to carefully place a new parchment, freshly inscribed with a number of their choosing (always between one and one hundred), atop the stack. The second, the Ceremony of Revelation, required them to remove the very top parchment and announce aloud the number written upon it, before setting it aside. This process was always safe, for their ancient laws ensured that the tower could never be entirely depleted\u2014there was always at least one parchment remaining to preserve the memory.\n\nThe day\u2019s proceedings were dictated by a scroll listing N commands (where N could be any number from one to one hundred). Each command was either a Rite of Inscription, accompanied by the chosen number, or a Ceremony of Revelation. The Archivists, ever methodical, would read the scroll line by line, performing each act in turn. For every Ceremony of Revelation, the number announced from the parchment was to be recorded in the Great Chronicle for posterity, in the exact order in which the ceremonies occurred.\n\nTo participate in this ritual, an Archivist would first declare how many commands would be performed that day. Then, for each command, they would either state, \u201cInscription with number Y,\u201d where Y was the number to be inscribed, or simply, \u201cRevelation,\u201d to indicate the removal and reading of the top parchment. At the end of the day, the Chronicle Keeper would write down, on a new line for each Ceremony of Revelation, the number that was read aloud during the ceremony, in the same order as they were performed.\n\nFor example, consider a day with six commands:  \n- The first command is a Ceremony of Revelation, so the Archivist removes the top parchment (which is marked zero) and reads aloud \u201czero.\u201d  \n- Next, they perform a Rite of Inscription with the number four, placing a new parchment marked \u201cfour\u201d on top.  \n- Another Rite of Inscription follows, this time with the number three, stacking it above the previous parchments.  \n- The next three commands are all Ceremonies of Revelation. With each, the top parchment is removed: first \u201cthree,\u201d then \u201cfour,\u201d and finally \u201czero\u201d again, each number being read aloud and recorded in order.  \nThus, the Chronicle Keeper would inscribe:  \n```\n0\n3\n4\n0\n```\n\nAnother day might require five consecutive Ceremonies of Revelation. Since the tower began with only parchments marked zero and no new numbers were inscribed, each ceremony would reveal a zero, and the Chronicle Keeper would write:  \n```\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n```\n\nAnd so the rituals of Numeria continued, each day mapped and chronicled, every parchment a memory, every act a testament to the Archivists\u2019 unwavering devotion to order and clarity.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Chromatica, two rival guilds vied for prestige: the Order of the Obsidian and the Society of Ivory. Each year, the Grand Festival of Spheres would be held, where the guilds would present their most prized orbs\u2014each infused with magic and assigned a unique worth. The Order of the Obsidian would bring forth N shadowy spheres, while the Society of Ivory would unveil M luminous ones. The worth of each obsidian orb, whispered about in the markets, was recorded in a secret ledger as the first sequence of numbers, while the value of each ivory orb was listed in a second.\n\nFestival tradition dictated a peculiar rule: any selection of orbs to be showcased had to favor the Order of the Obsidian. That is, the number of obsidian orbs displayed could never be less than those of ivory. The city\u2019s council, ever eager for spectacle, challenged the guilds to assemble a display that, while honoring this rule, would yield the greatest possible sum of magical worth\u2014a task requiring both cunning and discernment.\n\nThe guildmasters were given a parchment outlining the ritual: first, inscribe the number of obsidian and ivory orbs (N and M) on the top line. On the second line, write the magical worths of all obsidian orbs, separated by spaces. On the third line, do the same for the ivory orbs. After careful calculation and negotiation, the final answer\u2014the highest attainable sum of magical worth under the festival\u2019s rule\u2014would be announced before the crowd.\n\nOf course, the council imposed strict boundaries: neither guild could present more than two hundred thousand orbs, and every orb\u2019s worth, whether blessed or cursed, could range from a billion mana points below zero to a billion above. The council accepted only whole numbers, and it was even permitted to present no orbs at all, if that would be wisest.\n\nConsider, for example, a year when the Order of the Obsidian arrived with four orbs, boasting worths of 8, 5, -1, and 3, while the Society of Ivory brought three, with worths of 3, -2, and -4. The guilds could select the first, second, and fourth obsidian orbs, and the first ivory orb, amassing a total worth of nineteen\u2014a dazzling display. In another year, if the obsidian orbs were worth 5, -10, -2, and -5, and the ivory ones 8, 1, and 4, the optimal display would be the first and third obsidian orbs and the first and third ivory orbs, for a sum of fifteen. Yet there were darker years: if all obsidian orbs bore negative worths, such as -36, -33, and -31, and the ivory orbs were all positive, the guilds might be wise to present nothing at all, achieving a total worth of zero.\n\nThus, beneath the lanterns of Chromatica, the guilds pondered: how might they, within these traditions and constraints, assemble the most magnificent showcase of spheres, maximizing their honor and the festival\u2019s glory?",

        "question_title": "Minimum XOR Path",
        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Numeria, there stood a legendary maze of crystal bridges, each humming with a secret code. The city\u2019s council had once devised a challenge: to journey from the Gate of Dawn (marked as the first tower) to the Tower of Twilight (marked as the N-th tower), crossing only the bridges that connected the towers directly. Each bridge shimmered with a magical rune\u2014a non-negative integer less than two raised to the sixtieth power\u2014etched into its surface. The number of towers in Numeria was always at least two, and the bridges were so carefully constructed that every pair of towers was connected by at most one bridge, and the entire city was always fully reachable.\n\nThe council\u2019s challenge was not simply to traverse the city, but to do so with subtlety and cleverness. Travelers were to select a path from the Gate of Dawn to the Tower of Twilight, never stepping through the same tower twice\u2014such a path was known as a \u201cpure route.\u201d For each journey, the traveler would collect the runes of each bridge they crossed, then perform the city\u2019s sacred \u201cxor-ritual\u201d: for each pair of runes, if only one of the corresponding binary digits was a one, the result would be one; otherwise, it would be zero. This ritual was performed across all the collected runes, in any order, resulting in a single magical sum. The traveler\u2019s goal was to find the pure route that yielded the lowest possible magical sum from the xor-ritual.\n\nTo attempt this challenge, a traveler first stood before the council and announced their intentions by declaring two numbers: the count of towers (N, where N can be as large as ten) and bridges (M, which could be as few as one less than the towers, or as many as the total possible connections between towers). Then, for each bridge, the traveler would list the two towers it connected (with the smaller number first), and the rune inscribed on it. The council would then await the traveler\u2019s solution: the smallest magical sum achievable from any pure route between the Gate of Dawn and the Tower of Twilight.\n\nThe ritual of challenge was formalized as follows:  \n- The first line spoken must be two numbers: the total number of towers and the total number of bridges.  \n- The next M lines each described a bridge: two tower numbers (with the first always less than the second) and the rune\u2019s value.  \n- The traveler\u2019s answer was to be a single number, the lowest magical sum possible from any pure route from the first to the last tower.\n\nConsider, for instance, a scenario where the city has four towers and four bridges, with the following connections and runes:\n- Tower 1 to Tower 2 with a rune of 3\n- Tower 2 to Tower 4 with a rune of 5\n- Tower 1 to Tower 3 with a rune of 4\n- Tower 3 to Tower 4 with a rune of 7\n\nIn this case, there are two pure routes from the Gate of Dawn to the Tower of Twilight: one passing through towers 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 4 (whose xor-ritual yields 6), and another through 1 \u2192 3 \u2192 4 (whose xor-ritual yields 3). The council would expect the answer \u201c3\u201d, as it is the smallest magical sum.\n\nIn another tale, where the city had four towers and three bridges:\n- 1 to 2 with a rune of 1\n- 2 to 3 with a rune of 2\n- 3 to 4 with a rune of 4\n\nThere is only one possible pure route (1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 4), with a ritual sum of 7.\n\nAnd in the grandest of legends, with seven towers and ten bridges, each bridge inscribed with vast runes, the traveler\u2019s cleverest path yielded a ritual sum of 186751192333709144\u2014a number whispered for generations as a testament to Numeria\u2019s challenge.\n\nThus, the council\u2019s challenge endures: to find the most subtle and efficient pure route, collecting the runes and performing the xor-ritual, so that the magical sum is as small as possible.

The priority queue is implemented using the heapq module in Python. The heapq module provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm. It is used to represent the cities as nodes and the bridges as edges of a graph. The weight of the edge is the rune value of the bridge. The algorithm starts from the first tower (node 1) and explores the graph by visiting the nearest unvisited node at each step. The rune value of the bridge is added to the total sum if it is the first time the node is visited. The process is repeated until all nodes are visited. The final result is the smallest possible magical sum.\n",

The ritual of XOR, as defined by Numerian lore, is a binary operation: at each digit, if the two numbers differ, the result is 1; if they match, it is 0.\n\nThe rules are strict: for every edict, the sages at the specified seats must have secrets such that when their numbers undergo the XOR ritual, the result is exactly the magical number decreed by that edict. Every sage must keep a non-negative integer as their secret, and the king wishes to know if it is possible to assign secrets to all N sages so that every edict is satisfied. Furthermore, the king is a frugal monarch; he desires the total sum of all secrets among the sages to be as small as possible. If there are many ways to assign secrets with the minimal sum, any such arrangement will suffice.\n\nTo communicate the conditions to his court, the king specifies that the council chamber will receive a proclamation as follows: the first line will contain two numbers, the total number of sages N and the number of royal edicts M. The next M lines each contain three numbers, identifying the two sages (by their seat numbers, between 1 and N) and the magical XOR result decreed for their secrets. The kingdom\u2019s scholars are tasked with responding: if it is impossible for the sages to fulfill all the edicts, they must return a single number, -1, as a sign of failure. Otherwise, they must announce the secrets of all N sages, in order, with each secret separated by a space.\n\nThe Code of Parity is unyielding: there may be as many as two hundred thousand sages, and up to one hundred thousand edicts. The magical numbers Z from the edicts may be any non-negative integer up to a billion, but the secrets themselves must never be negative. The sages\u2019 seat numbers in the edicts will always be valid, falling between one and N.\n\nLet us consider a few tales from the archives. In one, the council of three sages receives two edicts: the first binds the sage at seat one and the sage at seat three with the number four, and the second binds the sage at seat one and the sage at seat two with the number three. One harmonious arrangement is for the sages to keep secrets zero, three, and four, respectively\u2014this fulfills all edicts and has the smallest possible total. In another tale, three sages are given three edicts, but find themselves at odds: there is no way to assign secrets that satisfy every decree, and so -1 is inscribed in the royal records. In a more intricate legend, five sages receive eight edicts and manage to assign secrets as zero, two, nine, six, and zero, fulfilling every edict with the least possible sum.\n\nThus, in the Kingdom of Numeria, the challenge is set: given the king\u2019s edicts, can the sages fulfill the Code of Parity, and if so, how should they assign their secrets to minimize the total sum? The fate of the council\u2014and the harmony of the realm\u2014rests on your answer.",

        "question_title": "Rotated Inversions",
        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Modulo, the Council of Numbers presides over a unique tradition every year. Here, N noble families each present a gemstone with a brilliance level, a non-negative integer no greater than the sacred modulus, M. These gemstones are displayed in a grand sequence, their radiance carefully measured and recorded for posterity. The Council, ever keen to maintain balance, introduces a magical twist to this ceremony: each year, they select a different enchantment level, which they call the \"kth shift,\" ranging from the calm of zero to the intensity of just one less than M.\n\nFor each enchantment level, a spell is cast on every family's gemstone, increasing its brilliance by the current enchantment before the brilliance is folded back into the realm of the modulus\u2014meaning, after the increase, only the remainder when divided by M truly matters. This yields a new sequence of gemstones, whose orderings are scrutinized for \"discords\": pairs where a gemstone precedes another yet outshines it after the spell. The Council calls these discords \"inversions,\" and they believe that counting them reveals the hidden harmony\u2014or chaos\u2014brought by each enchantment.\n\nYour task, as the Royal Scribe, is to assist the Council by determining, for each possible enchantment level, how many discords arise in the enchanted sequence. Specifically, for every enchantment from zero up to just before M, you must count the number of pairs of families where the earlier family's enchanted gemstone glows more brightly than that of a later family. The Council wishes to see the result for each enchantment, each on its own scroll line, so they may judge which year brings the greatest balance or the most tumult.\n\nThe tradition dictates how records are to be presented: The first scroll line must declare the numbers N and M\u2014the count of families and the modulus of brilliance. The second scroll line lists, in order, the original brilliance of each family's gemstone, separated by spaces. For your responses, you shall inscribe exactly M lines: the ith line (beginning with the first) must reveal the count of discords for the enchantment level equal to one less than the line's number.\n\nLet us revisit tales from the annals of Modulo. In the year when three families presented gemstones of brilliance 2, 1, and 0, and the modulus was 3, the scribe's scrolls read:\n\n3 3  \n2 1 0\n\nThe Council received these results:  \n3  \n1  \n1\n\nFor the unenchanted sequence (enchantment zero), the discords numbered three. With the first shift, the enchanted sequence became (0, 2, 1), yielding only one discord. The second shift produced (1, 0, 2), again with a single discord. Thus, the harmony of the city waxed and waned with each enchantment, as revealed by your careful tallying.\n\nThrough your wisdom, the Council will learn how the dance of brilliance and balance plays out across every possible enchantment\u2014guiding Modulo for another year.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient kingdom of Gridoria, the land was meticulously divided into a vast tapestry of rectangular plots\u2014rows and columns that stretched as far as the eye could see. Each plot, tended by a villager, bore either a glowing lantern (signifying a \u201c1\u201d) or a darkened lamp (a \u201c0\u201d). The kingdom\u2019s prosperity was measured not in gold, but in the number of shining lanterns that illuminated the grid each night.\n\nThe Queen of Gridoria, ever wise, established two sacred rituals to manipulate the lanterns\u2019 glow. The first, known as the Moon\u2019s Sweep, allowed the villagers of any chosen row to simultaneously invert the state of every lantern in their care\u2014if a lantern was shining, it would be dimmed, and if it was dark, it would be lit. The second, called the Sun\u2019s Gaze, permitted the same inversion, but along any chosen column, affecting every lantern in that vertical stretch. These rituals could be performed as many times and in any order the villagers desired, but only one complete row or column could be chosen for each invocation.\n\nThe Queen\u2019s challenge was clear: with only these two rituals at their disposal, the villagers must strive to make as few lanterns glow as possible across the entire kingdom, using the rituals as wisely and efficiently as possible. The prosperity of Gridoria depended not on the abundance of light, but on the skillful orchestration of darkness\u2014a curious tradition, but one that kept the kingdom cool and the stars visible at night.\n\nEach year, the royal census would collect the following information: First, the number of rows (call this H) and columns (W) in the kingdom\u2019s grid. Then, for each row, a string of W digits (each either 0 or 1), detailing the initial state of every lantern in that row from left to right. The villagers\u2019 goal was to deliver to the Queen the smallest total count of glowing lanterns that could possibly remain after any sequence of Moon\u2019s Sweeps and Sun\u2019s Gazes.\n\nFor example, suppose the census reported a kingdom with three rows and three columns, and the lanterns were arranged as follows:  \n100  \n010  \n110  \nAfter cleverly invoking the Sun\u2019s Gaze on the first column and the Moon\u2019s Sweep on the second row, the villagers could reduce the number of glowing lanterns to just two. No further combination of the rituals could do better, so the Queen would be pleased with the answer \u201c2.\u201d In another year, the census might report a grid where every lantern shone brightly\u2014four columns and three rows, each filled with ones. With the right sequence of rituals, the villagers could plunge the kingdom into total darkness, reporting a triumphant \u201c0.\u201d Or, in a more intricate arrangement spanning ten rows and five columns, the census might yield a final count of thirteen glowing lanterns after the best possible sequence of rituals.\n\nIn summary, the census-taker would present the Queen with the following:  \nFirst, two numbers for the number of rows and columns.  \nThen, for each row, a string of digits showing the lanterns\u2019 states.  \nThe Queen would expect a single number in return: the lowest number of glowing lanterns that could possibly remain after any sequence of the two rituals.\n\nThus, the annual challenge of Gridoria was set: with wisdom and strategy, find the path to the darkest, starriest night, and present the answer to the Queen.\n\n---\n\n**Sample Inputs and Outputs in Gridoria\u2019s Terms:**\n\n- For a grid of three rows and three columns, arranged as:  \n  100  \n  010  \n  110  \n  The villagers can achieve a minimum of 2 glowing lanterns.\n\n- For a grid of three rows and four columns, all lanterns glowing:  \n  1111  \n  1111  \n  1111  \n  The villagers can achieve total darkness, with 0 glowing lanterns.\n\n- For a larger grid of ten rows and five columns, with the lanterns arranged as follows:  \n  10000  \n  00111  \n  11000  \n  01000  \n  10110  \n  01110  \n  10101  \n  00100  \n  00100  \n  10001  \n  The villagers can do no better than 13 glowing lanterns after all rituals are performed optimally.",

Among their many responsibilities was the daily ritual of temperature measurement, a tradition that determined not just one\u2019s health, but also access to certain privileges and duties. Each morning, townsfolk would line up at the great Thermometer Gate, where a shimmering device would display their body warmth to one decimal place, falling somewhere between a chilly thirty and a burning fifty degrees, as measured by the city\u2019s scale.\n\nThe Council had established a strict code, known by all: those whose warmth reached at least thirty-eight and above were labeled as \u201cBlazing,\u201d and they would be swiftly escorted to the Healing Halls, for their fire was too great. Those whose warmth was at least thirty-seven and a half but had not quite reached the blazing mark were known as \u201cSimmering,\u201d watched carefully for signs of change. The rest, whose warmth remained below thirty-seven and a half, were considered \u201cCalm,\u201d free to go about their day.\n\nOn this particular morning, a young citizen named Takahashi approached the Gate, anxious to learn his fate. The device blinked and displayed his warmth\u2014a single number, precise to one decimal place. The Council\u2019s scribes awaited the result, ready to record not the description, but a secret code: \u201c1\u201d for Blazing, \u201c2\u201d for Simmering, and \u201c3\u201d for Calm. This code would determine the next steps for Takahashi\u2014whether he would rest, be monitored, or enjoy the freedom of health.\n\nTo participate in this ritual, a citizen would whisper their warmth into the Gate, which would accept a single line of input\u2014a real number with one decimal place. The Council\u2019s decree was clear: given this input, the scribe must issue the corresponding code as output. They would not write the full word, but only the number: \u201c1,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d or \u201c3,\u201d as prescribed by the ancient rules.\n\nLet us peer into the records of the Council for examples. When Takahashi\u2019s warmth was forty point zero, the Gate\u2019s scribe wrote \u201c1,\u201d for such heat was surely Blazing. When the warmth was thirty-seven point seven, the scribe wrote \u201c2,\u201d for this was the mark of Simmering. And when the warmth was thirty-six point six, the scribe wrote \u201c3,\u201d for Takahashi was Calm and well, free to roam the city.\n\nThus, in Thermopolis, the ritual was simple: a single number entered, a single code returned, and the fate of the citizen determined by the immutable laws of warmth.",

Each passage through a gate is recorded with a mystical ink: a swirl of indigo for every entrance and a circle of ochre for every exit. The registry, beloved and trusted, ensures that the city\u2019s flow remains harmonious and that every journey is properly accounted for.\n\nOne day, Takahashi, the diligent keeper of the Registry, discovered a calamity: a mischievous spirit had tampered with the records, causing some of the indigo and ochre marks to vanish. What he found was a string of surviving marks, a sequence composed only of the symbols for entry and exit, but with no guarantee that the pattern of journeys was correct. In the world of Metrovale, it is a sacred rule that every journey must begin with an entrance and be followed by an exit, alternating without interruption, and that no journey is left unfinished\u2014meaning the total number of marks must always be even, with entrances and exits paired perfectly.\n\nTakahashi\u2019s task is now clear. He must restore the records so they tell a proper story: the marks must alternate, starting with indigo for entrance, then ochre for exit, and so on, with every odd-numbered mark being an entry and every even-numbered mark being an exit. He can insert as many indigo or ochre marks as needed, at any position in the surviving sequence, but he is determined to restore the record with as few insertions as possible\u2014preserving the integrity of the original as much as he can.\n\nFor each case, the city\u2019s scribe will be handed a scroll bearing a single line of marks, a sequence of indigo and ochre symbols. The scribe must then inscribe, in a single line, the smallest number of additional marks that must be added so that the scroll will read as a perfect record\u2014one that alternates correctly and is even in length. The challenge is to do this efficiently, ensuring that no unnecessary marks are added and that the restored record is as close to the original as possible.\n\nTo illustrate, consider these scrolls from the archives:\n\n- When the scroll reads \"ioi\", Takahashi needs to insert only one ochre mark after the final symbol, making the record \"ioio\"\u2014a perfect alternation. Thus, the scribe inscribes \u201c1\u201d as the answer.\n- When the scroll reads \"iioo\", Takahashi must insert an ochre mark after the first symbol and an indigo mark after the third, resulting in the sequence \"ioioo\", and then one more insertion brings it to perfect alternation, for a total of \u201c2\u201d insertions.\n- For the scroll \"io\", the record already alternates perfectly and is even in length, so the scribe records \"0\".\n\nThus, by following these rules and restoring the records with the fewest magical insertions, Takahashi preserves the harmony of Metrovale\u2019s journeys, ensuring that every entrance is matched by an exit, and every story is told in perfect order.",

        "question_content": "In the sprawling city of Numeria, there exists a legendary river called the Array, famed for the way its waters flow in a line of shimmering stones. Each stone is etched with a number, and the river\u2019s length is determined by a great law: the number of stones, which we\u2019ll call N, must always be at least two, but can reach up to three hundred thousand should the river\u2019s guardians so decree. The stones themselves are magical, each bearing a number between one and N, and their arrangement is a mystery set forth by the city\u2019s ancient mathematicians.\n\nIn Numeria, it is a cherished tradition to split the river at a single point, dividing it into two living tributaries\u2014each a sequence of contiguous stones. The elders of the city gather to debate where the split should occur, for they prize diversity: in each tributary, they count how many *unique* numbers are present among the stones. The sum of these two counts becomes a measure of the harmony and difference sustained by the river\u2019s division.\n\nThe challenge is thus: for any possible way to split the Array\u2014any split that leaves both tributaries with at least one stone\u2014find the split that yields the greatest combined diversity. In other words, determine the maximum possible sum of unique numbers found in both resulting tributaries. The city\u2019s scholars note that only the most optimal split matters; lesser splits are of no interest when the greatest is sought.\n\nWhen a newcomer arrives to take on this challenge, the process is formalized. The Array\u2019s guardians first reveal the river\u2019s length (N) as a single number. Next, they present the sequence of stones, their numbers revealed in order. The challenger must then, using only this information, declare the highest possible combined diversity that can be achieved by splitting the river at any point.\n\nLet us see the tradition in practice. Suppose the guardians present a river of five stones, marked with the numbers: 3, 1, 4, 1, 5. The challenger considers every possible split:\n- After the first stone, the tributaries are (3) and (1, 4, 1, 5), with unique counts 1 and 3, totaling 4.\n- After the second stone, (3, 1) and (4, 1, 5) have unique counts 2 and 3, totaling 5.\n- After the third stone, (3, 1, 4) and (1, 5) have unique counts 3 and 2, totaling 5.\n- After the fourth stone, (3, 1, 4, 1) and (5) have unique counts 3 and 1, totaling 4.\nThe greatest combined diversity is 5, achieved for two different splits.\n\nIn another challenge, a river of ten stones is revealed: 2, 5, 6, 5, 2, 1, 7, 9, 7, 2. After careful deliberation, the optimal split is found to yield a combined diversity of 8.\n\nThus, in the city of Numeria, the wisdom of optimal division is not just a pastime, but a test of insight and harmony\u2014one where the most diverse and balanced split of the Array\u2019s stones is always the answer sought.",

        "question_content": "In the distant realm of Numeralis, the wise Council of Cubists presides over a land where the power of cubes shapes every facet of society. Here, the ancient law of \u201cCubical Balance\u201d governs the harmony between two clans: the Xenos and the Yari. Each year, the Grand Arbiter selects a number\u2014let\u2019s call it the Chosen Token, denoted by the symbol N, whose value can range from a humble 1 to a staggering 10 to the power of 18. This token represents a challenge: can the difference in the cube-might of a Xenos champion and a Yari champion equal exactly the Chosen Token?\n\nThe rules are clear and unyielding. Both the Xenos and Yari must each send forth a single champion, each bearing a distinct, positive integer as their Power Crystal\u2014never zero, never negative, and never the same for both. The Xenos champion\u2019s Power Crystal, raised to the third power, must surpass the Yari champion\u2019s own cubed Power Crystal by precisely the amount of the Chosen Token. No more, no less. The council\u2019s scribes are forbidden from using symbols for the names of the champions or their Crystals; only the Chosen Token is spoken of in such terms.\n\nYour quest is thus: Given the Chosen Token, determine whether there exists a pair of champions\u2014one from each clan\u2014whose Power Crystals, when cubed and compared, yield the exact difference dictated by the token. Should such a pair exist, you must reveal both their Power Crystals, in the order of Xenos then Yari, separated by a single pause (a space). Should no such champions be found in all the land, you must declare the attempt a failure by inscribing the mark of impossibility: negative one.\n\nWhen the council calls for judgment, the Chosen Token is announced aloud, with the challenger responding with either the two Power Crystals (Xenos first, Yari second, separated by a space), or the solitary mark of impossibility. The ritual is precise: only the Chosen Token is spoken; only a valid pairing or the mark of impossibility may be returned.\n\nConsider these chronicles from Numeralis:  \n\u2014 When the Chosen Token was three hundred ninety-seven, the council found that a Xenos champion with a Power Crystal of twelve and a Yari champion with a Power Crystal of eleven satisfied the law, for twelve cubed less eleven cubed equals three hundred ninety-seven.  \n\u2014 When the Chosen Token was one, not a single valid pairing could be found, for no two positive Power Crystals\u2019 cubes differ by exactly one. The mark of impossibility was inscribed.  \n\u2014 And when the Chosen Token reached thirty-nine trillion, nine hundred seventy-seven billion, two hundred seventy-three million, eight hundred fifty-five thousand, five hundred seventy thousand, eighty-eight, the council hailed the champions bearing Power Crystals of three hundred forty-two thousand, seven hundred fifty-six and sixty-six thousand, two hundred twelve, for their cubes\u2019 difference matched the Chosen Token perfectly.\n\nThus, the Council of Cubists invites you: given any Chosen Token, can you discover the two champions whose cubed strengths fulfill the law of Cubical Balance, or must you, too, inscribe the mark of impossibility?",

        "question_title": "Path Decomposition of a Tree",
        "question_content": "Certainly! Here is your coding problem reimagined as a narrative, following your instructions.\n\n---\n\nIn the ancient realm of Arboris, there stood a legendary tree known as the Grand Mosaic, whose branches stretched across the land, connecting NK sacred shrines, each marked with its own unique number from the first to the NK-th. These shrines were linked by enchanted bridges, each bridge unbreakable and allowing travel in both directions. The High Council of Arboris, ever fond of order and patterns, set forth a challenge: could the tree be partitioned into N sacred pilgrim trails, each precisely K shrines long, so that every shrine was visited exactly once, and every step along each trail followed the bridges of the Grand Mosaic?\n\nThe rules of this challenge were rooted in the customs of Arboris. First, the number of trails multiplied by the length of each trail must match the total number of shrines\u2014NK, no more and no less. Second, every shrine must appear in exactly one pilgrim trail and in one spot only, so that the collection of all the trails, when their shrines were listed in the order of travel, formed a grand permutation of all shrines. Finally, for each trail, every consecutive pair of shrines must be joined by a bridge\u2014no detours, leaps, or missing links allowed.\n\nTo attempt this feat, the Council provided a scroll with the following inscription: at the top, two mystical numbers, N and K, were written. Below that, a list of NK-1 pairs of numbers followed, each pair revealing the shrines joined by a bridge. The order of the shrines and the bridges was vital, for it mapped the precise structure of the Grand Mosaic. The Council decreed that the answer must be clear and honest: if the partition could be made as described, the word \"Yes\" must be proclaimed; if not, \"No\" must be declared.\n\nThe challenge, then, was not merely to find any set of trails, but to ensure that every shrine was included exactly once, each trail was of the right length, and each step followed the ancient bridges. The Council valued not only correctness, but also completeness\u2014no shrine left unvisited, no trail too short or too long, and no two trails sharing a shrine.\n\nFor those wishing to attempt this challenge, the Council explained how a response should be made: first, the scroll would begin with N and K. Then, each subsequent line would list a pair of shrine numbers, denoting a bridge. In reply, the challenger would simply state \"Yes\" or \"No,\" depending on whether such a partitioning was possible.\n\nTo illustrate, the Council shared two tales. In one, the scroll read:\n3 2  \n1 2  \n2 3  \n3 4  \n2 5  \n5 6  \nHere, it was indeed possible: one could form trails visiting shrines 1 and 2; 3 and 4; and 5 and 6, each trail perfectly following the rules\u2014thus, the answer was \"Yes.\"\n\nIn another, the scroll read:\n3 2  \n1 2  \n2 3  \n3 4  \n2 5  \n3 6  \nIn this case, no matter how one tried, it was impossible to carve the Grand Mosaic into three trails of two shrines each without breaking the rules\u2014hence, the answer was \"No.\"\n\nAnd so, the challenge was set: could the seeker of patterns master the Grand Mosaic and answer the Council\u2019s call?",

        "question_title": "Variety Split Hard",
        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeria, there exists a grand annual festival known as the Splitting Ceremony. Each year, the city\u2019s most skilled number-mages gather to witness a mesmerizing spectacle: the Great Sequence Parade, where a long train of enchanted number-creatures march in a line, each bearing a unique integer sigil upon their banners. The length of this parade is always denoted by a mysterious glyph, which the Numerians simply call N. This year, the parade is particularly grand, with N stretching anywhere from three to three hundred thousand.\n\nThe ancient rules of the Splitting Ceremony are strict. The parade may only be divided at exactly two gates\u2014marked by chosen parade officials\u2014such that the parade is split into three contiguous, non-empty segments. No segment may be left without at least one number-creature; the officials are careful to ensure that the first gatekeeper stands before the last one, and neither may stand at the very start or end of the parade. The challenge lies in the artistry of division: the Numerians seek to maximize the total diversity on display, measured by counting how many unique sigils appear in each of the three resulting sections, then summing these three numbers.\n\nThe task for each number-mage is clear: given the full list of sigils in the parade, they must determine the greatest possible sum of distinct sigils that can be achieved by splitting the parade at two chosen gates, in accordance with the ancient rules. This sum represents the total diversity that Numeria can display in this year\u2019s festival and is a matter of both pride and strategy. The mages work with utmost efficiency, for the parade can be exceedingly long, and only the cleverest can find the answer swiftly.\n\nTo participate, a mage must present their entry scroll in a prescribed format. First, they write the glyph N on the scroll\u2019s top line, signifying the length of the parade. On the second line, they inscribe the sequence of sigils, each separated by a space, in the order that the number-creatures will march. Once their calculations are complete, the mage must inscribe a single number: the maximum total diversity achievable by any valid split, as described by the festival\u2019s rules.\n\nFor example, in one year, the parade\u2019s scroll might read:\n```\n5\n3 1 4 1 5\n```\nThe wisest mages deduced that the greatest total diversity achievable was five\u2014by placing the gates so as to split the parade into (3,1), (4,1), and (5), each segment\u2019s unique banners counting two, two, and one respectively. No other arrangement could outshine this sum. In another festival, the scroll might say:\n```\n10\n2 5 6 4 4 1 1 3 1 4\n```\nand the calculated answer would be nine, reflecting the most splendid diversity possible that year.\n\nThus, the Splitting Ceremony continues, each year challenging Numeria\u2019s finest minds to find the most brilliant and diverse way to divide their beloved parade, ever seeking the highest sum of uniqueness that their enchanted number-creatures can muster.",

        "question_title": "Maximize Distance",
        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Numeria, a network of magical portals connected the city\u2019s many towers, each portal allowing travelers to journey instantly from one tower to another. The towers were numbered in order, from the first, known as the Tower of Beginnings, to the N-th, the Tower of Destiny. Each portal was inscribed with runes, initially dormant, so that every portal required no magical energy to use. However, the city\u2019s council had recently discovered a way to activate the runes on exactly K portals, causing those portals to demand a toll of one magical coin to traverse. The council wished to decide which portals to activate so as to make the journey from the Tower of Beginnings to the Tower of Destiny as arduous as possible, meaning they wanted to maximize the least magical coins that any traveler would have to pay on their shortest path.\n\nThe city\u2019s network was composed of M portals, each linking one tower to another in a single direction. The council\u2019s scribes had carefully recorded the connections: for each portal, they noted from which tower it began and to which it led. The council decreed that, regardless of which portals were activated, it must always be possible to reach the Tower of Destiny from the Tower of Beginnings. The towers and portals were many, but not innumerable\u2014no more than thirty towers and a hundred portals, and the number of portals to activate, K, was always at least one and never more than the total number of portals.\n\nThe council\u2019s challenge was clear: given the map of towers and portals, and the knowledge that they could activate the runes of exactly K portals (making them cost one magical coin while all others remained free), how should they choose which portals to activate so that the smallest number of coins any traveler would need on the quickest possible route from the Tower of Beginnings to the Tower of Destiny would be as large as possible? In other words, they sought to make the easiest journey as costly as they could, within their power.\n\nTo aid in this challenge, the council asked all visitors to submit their knowledge of the city\u2019s network in a specific manner. First, they would declare the number of towers, portals, and portals to activate, in that order. Then, for each portal, they would report two numbers: the tower of origin and the tower of destination. The council would then announce, in turn, the greatest possible toll (in magical coins) that could be imposed on the shortest path from the Tower of Beginnings to the Tower of Destiny, after optimally choosing which K portals to activate.\n\nFor example, in one instance, there were three towers and three portals, and the council could activate two portals. The portals connected towers as follows: from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, and from 1 to 3. The council found that no matter which two portals they activated, the shortest journey from the Tower of Beginnings to the Tower of Destiny could be made to cost at most one magical coin.\n\nIn another case, with four towers and four portals, and the ability to activate three portals, the portals connected towers as follows: from 1 to 2, from 1 to 3, from 3 to 2, and from 2 to 4. Here, the council\u2019s strategy allowed them to make the shortest possible journey from the Tower of Beginnings to the Tower of Destiny cost as many as two magical coins.\n\nIn a final example, with only two towers and two portals, and the power to activate one portal, both portals led from the Tower of Beginnings to the Tower of Destiny. Here, regardless of which portal was activated, there would always be a free path\u2014so the shortest journey could be made at no cost at all.\n\nThus, the council\u2019s challenge was set: given the map of portals and the number of runes to activate, to calculate the greatest minimum toll that could be imposed on the swiftest route from the beginning to the end of Numeria\u2019s magical network.",

In each iteration of the loop, it pops the node with the smallest toll from the heap, and then updates the tolls of its neighbors. If the neighbor's toll is greater than the new toll, it updates the neighbor's toll and pushes the neighbor into the heap. The program then prints the maximum toll among all the towers.\n",

        "question_content": "In the storied land of Palindoria, strings of symbols are not mere letters, but the foundations of magic itself. The mighty Council of Symmetry rules the order of spellcraft, decreeing that the strength of a spell depends upon the arrangement of ancient runes. Two runes are known throughout the realm: the Dash, humble and steady, and the Equal, rare and powerful. For any spell to pass the Council's test, it must be woven with a length chosen by the spellwright, referred to simply by the letter N. This number, N, is an integer between the value one and the value one hundred, inclusive.\n\nThe Council's decree mandates three sacred laws for spell creation. **First**, each position in the spell must hold either a Dash or an Equal\u2014no other rune will do. **Second**, the spell must be perfectly mirrored: if read from left to right or right to left, the pattern must remain unchanged, for symmetry is the heart of Palindoria's power. **Third**, and most crucially, each spell must contain either a single Equal rune or exactly a pair of Equal runes, but with the special condition that if there are two Equals, they must stand side by side, sharing their place in the center of the spell.\n\nAspiring mages are thus tasked: for any chosen value of N, they must construct the one and only spell that fulfills the Council's demands\u2014no more, no less. The challenge lies not only in the strictness of the rules, but in discovering that for every N, there is a unique spell that satisfies all laws. It is whispered among acolytes that only the most efficient spell, using the minimal required Equals and maximizing symmetry, will gain the Council\u2019s favor.\n\nWhen a mage wishes to attempt such a spell, they must approach the Council with a single number\u2014the length N\u2014written clearly before them. This is the only input the Council accepts. The answer, if the mage is successful, is the spell itself: a single line, composed only of Dashes and Equals, arranged according to the sacred laws.\n\nLet us consider two tales from recent Council hearings. In the first, a mage summoned the number four. The Council\u2019s response was a spell: Dash, Equal, Equal, Dash\u2014mirrored and with the Equals side by side in the center, as required. In another, when the number seven was called upon, the answer was a sequence of three Dashes, a single Equal in the very center, then three more Dashes\u2014a perfectly palindromic spell with exactly one Equal. Each of these examples serves as guidance for future spellwrights, forever enshrined in the archives of Palindoria.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Cardington, there existed a peculiar tradition among the city\u2019s seven most renowned magicians. Each year, these magicians would gather for the Festival of Patterns, where each would present a single, enchanted card from their personal collection. On each card, a magical number\u2014always an integer between one and thirteen\u2014would gleam in shifting colors for all to see. The magicians believed that the arrangement of numbers held hidden meanings, and so, every year, they would seek the rare and celebrated configuration known as the \"Grand Harmony.\"\n\nThe Grand Harmony was no ordinary pattern. To achieve it, five cards had to be chosen from the seven on display. But not just any five would do. The chosen set must contain exactly three cards bearing one distinct number, and exactly two cards bearing a different number. The legend insisted that these two numbers must be entirely unique within the chosen five\u2014no other numbers could intrude upon this delicate balance. It was said that the appearance of a Grand Harmony would foretell a year of prosperity for Cardington.\n\nAs the festival commenced, the magicians laid out their seven cards in a row for all to admire. The challenge was clear: could any group of five cards be gathered from these seven such that the Grand Harmony would emerge? The magicians\u2014and the citizens\u2014knew that this was not always possible. Sometimes, the numbers were too scattered, or too uniform, and the Grand Harmony would elude them.\n\nThe festival rules dictated how the numbers would be announced and judged. First, the magicians would one by one reveal the numbers on their cards, calling them out in order. The city\u2019s Oracle would then examine all possible groups of five cards from the seven, searching for a group that formed the Grand Harmony: three cards with one number, and two with another, with both numbers distinct. If such a group could be found, the Oracle would declare \"Yes,\" signaling the arrival of the Grand Harmony. If not, the Oracle would solemnly announce \"No,\" and the magicians would try again next year.\n\n**Input**: The seven card numbers are announced in a single line, separated by spaces.  \n**Output**: The Oracle proclaims either \"Yes\" if the Grand Harmony can be formed, or \"No\" if it cannot.\n\nConsider the following festival scenarios, each representing a different gathering:\n\n- When the magicians presented the numbers: `1 4 1 4 2 1 3`, the Oracle found that by selecting three cards showing one and two cards showing four, the Grand Harmony was achieved, and so declared \"Yes.\"\n- On another occasion, the numbers were: `11 12 13 10 13 12 11`. Here, no combination of five cards could form the required pattern, so the Oracle announced \"No.\"\n- In a festival where every magician presented a card with the number seven, the Oracle reminded all that five identical numbers do not qualify as a Grand Harmony, and thus declared \"No.\"\n- Lastly, when the numbers were: `13 13 1 1 7 4 13`, the Oracle discovered that by gathering three cards of thirteen and two cards of one, the Grand Harmony was once again achieved, and so the answer was \"Yes.\"\n\nIn this way, the magicians of Cardington would test their fortunes each year, ever in search of the elusive Grand Harmony among their enchanted cards.",

        "question_content": "In the Kingdom of Numeria, there dwelled N citizens, each distinguished by a unique badge number from the first citizen to the Nth. Each citizen cherished a secret number, an integer entrusted to them by fate itself. This number, known only to the citizen and the grand record-keeper, played a vital role in the annual ceremony of Uniqueness, where the council sought to honor the most distinct individual in the realm.\n\nAccording to the ancient customs of Numeria, the council would scrutinize the numbers held by all citizens. Any citizen whose secret number was found to be repeated among the others would be deemed \"common\" and would lose their eligibility for the special honor. Only those whose number was unique\u2014unshared by any of the other N-1 citizens\u2014would earn the council\u2019s attention.\n\nThe council\u2019s goal, however, was not merely to find any unique individual, but to celebrate the one whose secret number was the greatest of all unique numbers revealed that year. Should there be no such unique number\u2014if every citizen\u2019s number was matched by another\u2014the council would solemnly declare that no one deserved the honor that cycle. The pursuit was thus to uncover, efficiently and without error, the highest unique number and the badge number of its bearer.\n\nFor the ceremony, the grand record-keeper would receive a scroll from the oracle containing the total number of citizens, followed by a line listing each citizen's secret number in order\u2014from the first badge-holder to the Nth. The council expected a single number in response: the badge number of the citizen with the greatest unique number. If there was no such citizen, the council required that the record-keeper present \"-1\" to mark the absence of uniqueness.\n\nConsider two moments from Numerian history:\n- In one year, there were nine citizens, whose secret numbers were: 2, 9, 9, 7, 9, 2, 4, 5, and 8. Investigating, the council found that only the fourth, seventh, eighth, and ninth badge-holders had unique numbers (7, 4, 5, and 8, respectively). Among them, the ninth badge-holder, with the secret number 8, possessed the highest. Thus, the council awarded the honor to citizen 9.\n- On another occasion, there were only four citizens, holding the numbers 1000000000, 1000000000, 998244353, and 998244353. Alas, every number was shared; there were no unique numbers among them. The council, with a heavy heart, announced \"-1\" to the people, for there was no worthy recipient that year.\n\nThrough these traditions, the Kingdom of Numeria preserved the spirit of uniqueness, forever seeking the citizen whose secret number set them apart from all others.",

        "question_content": "Certainly! Here is a narrative transformation of your coding problem, with all constraints and rules faithfully woven into a story, following your requested structure and guidelines:\n\n---\n\nIn the ancient city of Gridiron, there exists a mystical campfire at the heart of the world, its flames situated at the Crossing of Origins (the very spot called \u201czero-zero\u201d by the mapmakers). Every dawn, the air is still, but as the day unfolds, magical winds\u2014guided by the hand of fate\u2014begin to blow. Each hour, a messenger wind arrives from the North, West, South, or East, as dictated by a prophecy carried on a scroll of length N, where N is known to be no less than one and no greater than two hundred thousand. None know which way the wind will turn, for the scroll is different every day, but it is always composed solely of those four sacred directions. \n\nWhen a new hour strikes, the winds rise, and every wisp of smoke that lingers in the world is swept away in unison, moving exactly as the prophecy commands for that hour: northward winds push all smoke one step up the map, westward one step left, and so on. Yet the people of Gridiron have observed a curious law: if, after this movement, there is no smoke at the Crossing of Origins, the campfire conjures a fresh plume, ensuring the city\u2019s heart is never bare. Thus, with each hour, the smoke dances to the wind\u2019s tune, and if needed, the campfire rekindles its shroud anew.\n\nNow, imagine a solitary traveler named Takahashi, who stands vigil at a distant point on the grid, marked by coordinates (R, C), always somewhere other than the Crossing itself. R and C are each chosen such that their distance from the Crossing never exceeds N, but they may be positive or negative, as the grid stretches infinitely in all directions. Takahashi wishes to know, for each hour described by the prophecy, if at the halfway moment between one wind and the next\u2014that is, at the time called t plus one-half\u2014he is shrouded in smoke or stands in clear air.\n\nYour charge, then, is to deliver a missive: for each hour of the prophecy, inscribe a code\u2014\u20181\u2019 if Takahashi stands amidst smoke at the crucial halfway mark, \u20180\u2019 if not. Your answer must be a string of length N, each mark corresponding to a single hour, written in order, with no spaces or punctuation.\n\nWhen the prophecy is delivered, its form will always be as follows:\n- First, a single line: the scroll\u2019s length N, then Takahashi\u2019s chosen row R and column C, all separated by spaces.\n- On the next line: the prophecy itself\u2014a string of length N, composed solely of the letters N, W, S, and E, each standing for a wind from North, West, South, or East, respectively.\n\nYour response, likewise, must be a single line of N digits, each digit either zero or one, with the t-th digit representing whether Takahashi is wreathed in smoke at time t plus one-half.\n\nLet us see how this plays out in practice. Suppose a prophecy reads as follows:  \n6 -2 1  \nNNEEWS  \nThen you would reply:  \n001010  \nFor, at the halfway moments of hours three and five, Takahashi at his post finds himself among the smoke, but at all other halfway marks, the air is clear.\n\nOr if the prophecy is:  \n10 1 2  \nNEESESWEES  \nThen:  \n0001101011  \nFor, here, the smoke\u2019s meandering journey brings it to Takahashi at precisely the times marked by ones, and leaves him bare at the moments marked by zeroes.\n\nAnd in another challenge:  \n20 -1 -2  \nWWNNWSWEWNSWWENSNWWN  \nYou would answer:  \n00100111111000101111  \n\nThus, the winds of Gridiron, the rules of smoke, and the watchful eyes of Takahashi come together in a puzzle of prophecy, wind, and wits.",

It then checks if Takahashi is shrouded in smoke at the halfway moment between the current wind and the next one. If he is, it adds a '1' to the result; otherwise, it adds a '0'. The program finally prints the result.\n",

        "question_content": "**Background**\n\nIn the ancient city of Palindoria, there existed a grand tradition among the scribes: every important proclamation began with a royal phrase, and the entire proclamation had to be as harmonious and balanced as possible. This harmony was achieved when the proclamation could be read the same forwards and backwards\u2014a palindromic decree. The length of each proclamation was crucial, for the longer it was, the more ink and parchment it consumed, and the Queen was keen to conserve resources. Thus, scribes were tasked with crafting the shortest possible palindromic proclamation, always ensuring the royal phrase stood proudly at its beginning.\n\n**Rules and Problem Setting**\n\nThe royal phrase, whispered directly from the Queen, was always a string of uppercase letters from the ancient alphabet. Its length, denoted in the kingdom\u2019s records as N, could be as short as one or as lengthy as half a million symbols. Each scribe received only this phrase as their starting point\u2014no more, no less. The proclamation, when finished, must always begin with this phrase, and must be a true palindrome: it should read identically from start to finish and from finish to start. The scribes were free to extend the proclamation by adding additional letters (if necessary) after the royal phrase, but could not alter the phrase itself.\n\n**Task Explanation**\n\nThe challenge for each scribe was to extend the royal phrase by appending as few letters as possible, crafting the briefest balanced proclamation that fulfilled the palindromic law. If the royal phrase was already a palindrome, then no additions were needed\u2014the proclamation was perfect in its initial form. However, if it was not, the scribe would cleverly append the minimal sequence of letters to the end, ensuring the whole could be read the same forwards and backwards. There might be more than one way to achieve this balance, but any valid shortest proclamation was considered a triumph.\n\n**Input and Output Format in the Story**\n\nEach morning, the Queen\u2019s herald would deliver a sealed scroll containing the royal phrase. The scribe\u2019s task was to inscribe on a fresh parchment the full proclamation\u2014beginning with the royal phrase and ending with the shortest possible palindromic form. The process was as follows:\n- **Input**: A single line containing the royal phrase (a string of uppercase letters, of length N, where 1 \u2264 N \u2264 500,000).\n- **Output**: A single line containing the shortest palindromic proclamation that begins with the royal phrase.\n\n**Examples and Closing**\n\nTo illustrate, let us look at a few chronicles from Palindoria\u2019s archives:\n- When the phrase was \u201cABC\u201d, the scribe produced \u201cABCBA\u201d. Here, the scribe appended \u201cBA\u201d to achieve perfect symmetry.\n- When the phrase was a solitary \u201cZ\u201d, the scribe needed no additions, for \u201cZ\u201d was already balanced.\n- When the phrase was \u201cTREE\u201d, the scribe appended \u201cRT\u201d to form \u201cTREERT\u201d, the shortest proclamation that began with \u201cTREE\u201d and could be read identically in both directions.\n\nThus, the scribes of Palindoria, through wit and tradition, ensured every royal phrase was enshrined in the most elegant and efficient palindromic proclamation possible.",

It creates the reverse of the input string and then checks if the input string starts with the reversed string from the current position.

The remaining part of the reversed string is then added to the input string to form the shortest palindrome.

The reversed string is then added to the input string to form the shortest palindrome.\n",

        "question_content": "Certainly! Here is the transformed coding problem in narrative story format according to your guidelines:\n\n---\n\nIn the ancient City of Nodal, there existed a sprawling kingdom composed of **N great houses**. These houses were connected by a series of **M ancient alliances**, each alliance a secret pact between two houses. The wise scribes had carefully catalogued every alliance, noting which two houses were bound by each\u2014no two alliances were ever identical, and, by the decree of the ancestors, no tangled conspiracy (known as an *odd circle of trust*) was permitted to exist among the houses at the kingdom\u2019s founding.\n\nNow, a peculiar contest was to be held in the Grand Court, pitting the cunning Lord Aoki against the shrewd Lady Takahashi. The rules, set by the Council of Scribes, were as follows: beginning with Lord Aoki, the two would alternate turns. On each turn, the current player could forge a new, previously nonexistent alliance between any two distinct houses, provided two ironclad conditions held: first, the chosen houses had never been allied before; and second, the forging of this new alliance would **not** create an *odd circle of trust*\u2014that is, a closed loop of houses where each pair in the loop is directly joined by an alliance, the number of houses in the loop is odd, and the path returns to its starting house.\n\nThe contest would end the moment a player could no longer forge a new alliance without breaching these conditions. The one left without a legal move would be shamed before the court, and their rival would be crowned the master strategist.\n\nAs a chronicler of the city, your role is to discern the outcome of this contest when both players use their wits to the fullest. Given the initial records of houses and alliances, you must determine whether Lord Aoki (who always goes first) or Lady Takahashi (who follows) will surely claim victory.\n\nThe scribes have entrusted you with the following parchment as input: the first line lists the count of noble houses and the number of existing alliances; each subsequent line lists a pair of houses joined by an alliance. In the ledger, the houses are numbered from the first up to the N-th, and every number on the parchment is a whole number.\n\nUpon your conclusion, you are to inscribe the victor\u2019s name\u2014either \u201cAoki\u201d or \u201cTakahashi\u201d\u2014upon the final scroll.\n\n**Let us consider the chronicles of three past matches:**\n\n- **First Chronicle:** In a city of four houses and three alliances (between the first and second, the second and third, the third and fourth houses), Lord Aoki, moving first, can forge the last legal alliance (between the first and the fourth houses), leaving Lady Takahashi with no options. Thus, Aoki prevails.\n- **Second Chronicle:** In another city of four houses but only two alliances (between the first and second, and between the third and fourth houses), no matter how Lord Aoki moves, Lady Takahashi finds the winning path and claims victory.\n- **Third Chronicle:** In a larger city of nine houses and five alliances (those between the second and ninth, second and third, fourth and sixth, fifth and seventh, and first and eighth houses), through careful maneuvering, Lord Aoki once again emerges triumphant.\n\nAnd so, the fates of the noble houses rest upon your wit as you unravel the outcome of this grand contest of alliances.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling kingdom of Lexiconia, there stood a grand Hall of Mirrors, famed throughout the land. The hallkeeper, a wise sage named Numerius, delighted in intricate tests of symmetry and difference. Each year, he welcomed a steady stream of visitors who brought with them enchanted scrolls\u2014each scroll inscribed with a **sequence of glyphs**. Numerius\u2019s favorite challenge was the Ritual of Reflection, where two champions would stand at opposite ends of the hall, each holding a scroll of precisely **N glyphs**. The length N could be any positive whole number, but never more than one hundred, as the hall\u2019s enchantments would allow no more.\n\nThe rules of Lexiconia\u2019s Ritual were strict. Both scrolls\u2014one carried by the first champion, the other by the second\u2014must bear lines of glyphs drawn only from the sacred alphabet of the kingdom, and each scroll had to be of exactly the same length, N. When the Ritual began, Numerius would examine the glyphs at every position on both scrolls, starting from the first and moving to the last. For each spot where the glyphs **did not match**, Numerius would solemnly ring a silver bell, marking a difference. Champions and spectators alike knew that what Numerius truly sought was the **count of all such mismatches**\u2014the precise number of places where the two scrolls failed to reflect one another.\n\nTo participate in the Ritual, visitors would approach Numerius and provide three things:  \nFirst, a number, signifying the length of the scrolls.  \nSecond, the sequence of glyphs on the first scroll.  \nThird, the sequence of glyphs on the second scroll.  \nAll three would be whispered in order, so that Numerius could perform his tally. After careful comparison, Numerius would announce a single number\u2014the **total count of differences** between the two scrolls.\n\nLet us clearly lay out the **input and output etiquette** for the Ritual:  \nChampions must declare, in this order:  \n1. The single integer N, representing the scrolls' length.  \n2. The sequence of glyphs on the first scroll.  \n3. The sequence of glyphs on the second scroll.  \nNumerius, after his count, will reply with a single integer: the number of differences.\n\nNow, consider a few tales from past rituals:  \n- When two scrolls, each of length six, bore the glyphs \u201cabcarc\u201d and \u201cagcahc,\u201d Numerius found two places where the glyphs clashed and so sounded his bell twice.  \n- Another pair offered scrolls of length seven: \u201catcoder\u201d and \u201ccontest.\u201d Each glyph from the first failed to find its twin in the second, resulting in seven tolls of the bell.  \n- On a day of rare harmony, two scrolls both bore the glyphs \u201cchokudai\u201d across eight places. Numerius found no differences at all, and therefore, the hall remained silent.  \n- And in the most recent contest, scrolls of length ten\u2014\u201cvexknuampx\u201d and \u201cvzxikuamlx\u201d\u2014revealed four mismatched glyphs, and so the bell rang four times.\n\nThus, the Ritual of Reflection continues: a sacred test of similarity and difference, where the goal is always to count with perfect precision the number of mismatches between the glyphs, and to do so as fully and efficiently as the magic of Lexiconia allows.",

Each contestant, from the first to the N-th, faces demanding trials and emerges with a score\u2014a unique reflection of their prowess\u2014carefully noted in the annals of the city\u2019s records. However, the city\u2019s traditions are particular: the order in which glory is bestowed is dictated by a strict ceremonial system rather than a simple listing of scores.\n\nLong ago, the Council of Numeralis decreed the \u201cAscending Glory\u201d ceremony. At its heart is a single glowing stone\u2014let us call it the Rankstone\u2014whose power begins at the first level of prestige. At the start, none of the N contenders know their standing. The High Scribe surveys the list, seeking out those who have achieved the highest yet unawarded feat. All those who share this unmatched score are, by the customs of Numeralis, to be honored with the current Rankstone value. After their elevation, the Rankstone\u2019s power is increased\u2014by as much as the number of new honorees\u2014before the Scribe returns to the remaining unranked to repeat the rites.\n\nYour mission, as the Scribe\u2019s apprentice, is to record the final honorific order for all the contestants, using the Ascending Glory tradition. For each of the N individuals, identified by their original place in the registry, you must inscribe the single integer that represents the glory rank they have earned. The process must be followed methodically until no participant remains unranked, and your recording must be as swift and precise as possible.\n\nIn the ceremony\u2019s ledger, the number of contestants, N, is inscribed first. The next line records the marks of achievement, with each score corresponding to a participant in order. Upon completing your sacred tally, you must write exactly N lines, each bearing the honored rank of the corresponding participant. The first line shall declare the rank of the first contestant, the second for the second, and so forth, until all are honored.\n\nLet us consider a few chronicles from previous years, to guide you in your duty:\n- In a year where four contenders earned scores of 3, 12, 9, and 9, the rankings bestowed were 4, 1, 2, and 2. The highest score\u201412\u2014was awarded first (rank 1); next, the pair with scores of 9 shared the next highest honor (rank 2); finally, the lone remaining contestant received the next available rank (rank 4).\n- In another year, three contestants tallied 3, 9, and 6. Their glory was awarded thus: 3, 1, 2.\n- On a remarkable day when every one of four contestants matched each other with a score of 100, their glory was shared equally, all receiving the highest honor\u2014rank 1.\n- In a busy contest of eight, with achievements of 87, 87, 87, 88, 41, 38, 41, and 38, the ranks became: 2, 2, 2, 1, 5, 7, 5, 7.\n\nArmed with these chronicles and your knowledge of Numeralis\u2019s sacred customs, you are now ready to fulfill your role. Ensure that every participant\u2019s honor is tallied exactly to tradition\u2014no more, no less\u2014so that the prestige of Numeralis may always be preserved.",

        "question_content": "In the kingdom of Arboralis, the land is dotted with enchanted towers, each built by the hands of ancient architects and numbered in sequence from the first to the N-th. Over the centuries, wise sages have strung magical bridges between these towers\u2014M in total\u2014each bridge linking a pair of towers in a secretive pattern, with no two bridges ever connecting the same pair of towers, and no bridge looping from a tower back to itself. The chronicles record each bridge by noting the two towers it connects.\n\nFor generations, Arboralis thrived on harmony and order, and the sages decreed a special law: no wanderer shall ever be able to start at a tower, cross a series of bridges, and return to their starting point without retracing a bridge. Whenever this forbidden path\u2014known as a cycle\u2014appeared, the magic of the land would falter. Thus, a council of keepers arose, entrusted with the task of surveying the realm and ensuring that, at any moment, the network of bridges could transform into a tranquil woodland\u2014what the sages call a \"forest,\" where every collection of bridges forms no closed loops, and every set of towers is as interconnected as possible without breaking the cycle taboo.\n\nThe council\u2019s challenge is this: given the scrolls listing every tower and bridge, how many bridges must be carefully unbound\u2014at a minimum\u2014to restore the land to a perfect forest? Each removal must be judicious, for the keepers wish to preserve the connectedness of the land as much as possible while banishing all cycles.\n\nFor the keepers to solve this riddle, they must first hear the tale in the proper format: the scroll begins with a line inscribed with the total number of towers and bridges, followed by M lines, each detailing a pair of towers bound by a bridge. After their calculations, the council is to return a single number\u2014the smallest count of bridges that must vanish for Arboralis to be free of cycles once more.\n\nLet us see a few tales brought before the council. In one case, the scroll reads:\n4 4  \n1 2  \n1 3  \n2 4  \n3 4  \nHere, the council finds that removing just a single bridge (for instance, the one linking the first and second towers) is sufficient; the realm is then restored to a forest. In another scroll with five towers and no bridges at all, the council proclaims that no action is needed. And in a more intricate tale, ten towers and ten bridges are listed:\n10 10  \n7 9  \n4 6  \n6 10  \n2 5  \n5 6  \n5 9  \n6 8  \n4 8  \n1 5  \n1 4  \nAfter much deliberation, the council determines that at least two bridges must be removed to break all cycles and restore peace.\n\nAnd so, each time a new scroll arrives, the keepers heed its call, unravel its meaning, and pronounce the bare minimum number of bridges to unbind\u2014ensuring Arboralis forever remains a land of open paths and harmonious forests.",

        "question_title": "Switch Seats",
        "question_content": "In the wondrous city of Linearia, every year the Grand Alignment is held\u2014a social ceremony where **N distinct couples** are invited to sit along a single, endless marble bench. The hosts, in their peculiar fashion, arrange all the guests in a line, with each individual assigned a number from one to N, and with each couple always represented by two identical tokens, signifying their unbreakable partnership. Yet, when these couples are seated, their members are not always side by side, for the hosts delight in a bit of chaos, spreading out the pairs across the bench so that every token appears exactly twice, but not necessarily together.\n\nAccording to ancient tradition, there's a curious challenge whispered among the guests: \u201cCount every pair of couples who, though not originally seated together, might\u2014by partaking in the custom of the Dance of Swaps\u2014be able to reposition themselves so that both couples can sit next to their own beloved, simply by exchanging seats among the four people involved.\u201d However, a strict decorum is enforced: for any duo of couples considered, neither may already be sitting together, and only swaps between members of a couple with those of another are permitted in each move, repeating the process as many times, in any order, as needed.\n\nFor each gathering, your task is to determine how many distinct pairs of couples could meet these criteria and successfully unite both sets of partners side by side, following the sacred rules of Linearia. To clarify, you are given a number representing the count of couples present, followed by a list showing the current sequence of tokens (with each couple\u2019s token appearing exactly twice), and you must, for each event, deduce the number of valid pairs of couples who can achieve the dream of adjacency through these swap traditions.\n\nWhen the guests arrive, the host will announce the number of test gatherings to consider. For each, you will be told the number of couples and then the actual seating arrangement\u2014a list of tokens twice as long as the couple count\u2014where each token between one and the couple count appears exactly two times. After pondering, for each gathering, you should respond with a single number on a separate line, indicating how many pairs of couples might, by following the Dance of Swaps, achieve their adjoining seats.\n\nBy the laws of the city, the following must always be observed:  \n- The number of gatherings cannot exceed twice ten to the fifth power.  \n- The number of couples per gathering cannot exceed twice ten to the fifth power.  \n- The total number of couples across all gatherings combined never exceeds twice ten to the fifth power.  \n- Every seating has precisely two tokens per couple, and all values are integers.\n\nFor example, imagine the first gathering with three couples and the seating order: 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2. Here, only the pair of couples numbered one and two could, by means of the swap, both end up sitting together side by side\u2014after the proper exchanges\u2014even though they were not adjacent at the start. In a second gathering of four couples with the arrangement 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, there is no such pair, as the couples are already as close as possible. For a third event with five couples and the seating 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, there are four such pairs that can be joined.\n\nSo, as you walk the marble halls of Linearia, remember: Your challenge is to count for each gathering how many couples might, by swaps alone, fulfill the dream of sitting together, faithfully following the city's ancient social logic.",

Each cycle represents a pair of couples that can be swapped to get them to sit together. The size of each cycle is the number of couples in that pair, and the number of cycles is the number of pairs of couples that can be swapped to get them to sit together. The number of pairs is calculated by subtracting 1 from the size of each cycle and summing these values. The result is divided by 2 because each pair of couples is counted twice (once for each member of the couple).\n",

        "question_content": "In the sprawling bureaucracy of the Dominion of Letters, every citizen bore a personal sigil\u2014an unchanging character inscribed upon their cloak. The Dominion\u2019s Council, striving for perfect order, occasionally sought to unify one congregation\u2019s cloaks with another\u2019s. This particular year, they summoned the Keepers from two distant provinces: the first, whose people displayed sigils in a precise sequence called the String of Shadows, and the second, whose own sequence was named the Tapestry of Twilight. Each sequence was of the same length, determined by an integer revered as N, and each sigil was one of the twenty-six permitted by the Dominion\u2014simple, lowercase symbols from \u2018a\u2019 to \u2018z\u2019.\n\nThe Council\u2019s law was strict but not inflexible. Their magic allowed the following: at any moment, they could decree that every citizen displaying one chosen sigil must, in an instant, replace it with another sigil of their choosing. This proclamation could be repeated as many times as necessary\u2014though each such sweeping transformation was taxing and thus to be minimized. However, a sigil could not be transformed into itself (as this would be wasteful), and each decree affected all who bore the targeted sigil, regardless of their place in the sequence. The Council\u2019s goal was ambitious: with the minimum number of proclamations, could they completely reshape the String of Shadows, so that at the end of all magic, it matched the Tapestry of Twilight exactly, sigil for sigil, position for position?\n\nThe problem, then, was this: given the sacred integer N, and the two sequences\u2014one from the String of Shadows, the other from the Tapestry of Twilight\u2014the Council needed to determine whether such a transformation was possible. If it was, they must also find the smallest number of proclamations required. Should it be impossible, they would signal their defeat with a somber -1, an admission that no sequence of magic could bridge the differences.\n\nTo receive their instructions, the Council would open the ancient Input Ledger, which would present:\nFirst, the integer N, inscribed on a line by itself,\nSecond, the String of Shadows\u2014N characters on the next line,\nThird, the Tapestry of Twilight\u2014N characters on the final line.\n\nIn return, the Council would declare their result in the Output Scroll:\nEither the smallest number of proclamations needed to achieve perfect unity, or -1 if the task was beyond even their considerable powers.\n\nLet us see how this unfolded in various years, as recorded in the Archives of Examples:\n\n**Year of the Fourfold Shift:**  \nThe Ledger read: 6, afbfda, bkckbb.  \nThrough four proclamations\u2014first b to c, then a to b, then f to k, and finally d to b\u2014the String of Shadows became identical to the Tapestry of Twilight. The Council wrote \u201c4\u201d on the Scroll.\n\n**Year of Harmony:**  \nThe Ledger read: 4, abac, abac.  \nSince the two sequences were already in perfect accord, not a single proclamation was required. The Scroll bore a proud \u201c0\u201d.\n\n**Year of the Impossible Riddle:**  \nThe Ledger read: 4, abac, abrc.  \nNo sequence of proclamations could bridge the rift; the Council, in defeat, inscribed \u201c-1\u201d.\n\n**Year of the Complete Reversal:**  \nThe Ledger read: 4, abac, bcba.  \nWith careful planning, four proclamations sufficed, and the Scroll echoed this with a \u201c4\u201d.\n\nThrough these chronicles, the Dominion\u2019s citizens learned how to interpret the Council\u2019s decrees, translating the subtle dance of sigil transformations into decisive acts of unity or the honest confession of impossibility.",

Otherwise, it starts a BFS from the first different sigil in the String of Shadows. For each sigil, it checks all its transformations and adds them to the queue if they haven't been visited before. The BFS continues until all sigils have been visited or a sigil that matches the Tapestry of Twilight has been found. If a matching sigil is found, the number of steps taken is returned. If no matching sigil is found after all sigils have been visited, -1 is returned.\n",

        "question_content": "In the bustling metropolis of Numeria, legends tell of the Great Library, a place where knowledge is measured not only by the tomes on its shelves, but by the wisdom hidden within the shelves themselves. One day, the Grand Archivist announces a challenge to all aspiring scholars: to unravel the secret power held by the mystical sequence of tomes, each imbued with a special strength. The number of tomes is always a positive quantity, which some scribes call N. For each tome, there is a recorded strength\u2014these are passed down as a list, always in the same order\u2014overseen by the scribes as a sequence of length N. The Archivist also reveals an ancient rune, K, said to amplify the power of knowledge by an extraordinary degree.\n\nThe challenge is governed by the ancient laws of Numeria. The scholars must consider every possible continuous stretch of tomes\u2014from a single tome to the grand sweep of the entire shelf. For each such stretch, they must sum the strengths of the tomes within, then raise that sum to the power of the rune K, harnessing the full magical amplification. Once every possible stretch has been so empowered, the total of all these energies must be gathered. However, Numeria\u2019s magic is cyclical, so the final answer must be given as the remainder when divided by the city\u2019s grand modulus\u2014a number whispered as 998244353.\n\nThe Archivist sets forth the exact ritual for presenting knowledge: first, the scholar must declare how many tomes are on the shelf (the value N), followed by the strength of the rune (the value K). Next, the strengths of the tomes must be listed in order, each following the last like pearls on a string. In return, the scholar is to reveal a single number: the total magical energy achieved, after applying Numeria\u2019s modulus, following the rules above.\n\nThe laws are precise: The number of tomes must always be at least one, and never more than two times ten raised to the fifth power. The rune\u2019s strength must be no less than one and no more than ten. Each tome\u2019s strength is at least zero but always less than Numeria\u2019s modulus itself. The tome strengths and all quantities are always to be counted as whole numbers\u2014no fragments of tomes or mystical runes allowed.\n\nTo aid the scholars, the Archivist shares a few tales from past challengers. In one account, a shelf of three tomes with strengths three, one, and two, and a rune of strength two, yielded a total magical energy of seventy-five. In another, a single tome with no strength and a rune of ten yielded a total energy of zero. In a more ambitious challenge, ten tomes with strengths ninety-one, fifty-nine, eighty-five, sixty, fifty-seven, seventy-two, twelve, three, twenty-seven, and sixteen, under a rune of strength five, resulted in a total energy of four hundred twenty-eight million six hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred eighty-five, once all things were considered under the modulus of Numeria.\n\nSo the challenge stands: given the list of tome strengths, the value of the amplifying rune, and the number of tomes, determine the total magical energy as decreed by Numeria\u2019s laws, and present it as described\u2014so that your name may be inscribed among the greatest scholars ever to walk these hallowed shelves.",

        "question_content": "Long ago, in the majestic land of Quadratia, a grand festival known as the Jubilee of Four Hundred was held to honor the wisdom of the ancients. Every century, the council gathered exactly four hundred citizens for the Ceremony of Alignment\u2014a ritual where the chosen souls stood in a perfect rectangle, side by side, row upon row, with not a single gap between them. The elders believed that the harmony of this arrangement brought prosperity for years to come.\n\nThis ceremony held strict societal codes. The number of rows, always referred to as the \"Aspect,\" could be any positive whole number between one and four hundred, chosen by the council\u2019s decree on the morning of the festival. The citizens then had to determine the \u201cBalance\u201d\u2014that is, how many columns each row should contain\u2014so every participant found their place in the formation and no one was left aside. The assembled crowd demanded that both the Aspect and the Balance be positive, and together, their multiplication must exactly account for all four hundred celebrants. If it was ever impossible to create such a seamless rectangle\u2014if the Aspect did not evenly divide the total gathering\u2014Quadratia\u2019s code called for a herald to announce the sacred number of impossibility: negative one.\n\nOn this particular festival, the council would publicly announce the chosen Aspect to the people. In return, the scribes were tasked to swiftly declare the correct Balance that would allow the assembly to proceed without delay. Should no suitable Balance exist for the given Aspect, the scribes must instead call out the solemn \u201cnegative one,\u201d signaling the ceremony must not proceed with that configuration.\n\nThe process was governed by a well-known method. The Aspect, announced aloud, was the only information provided to the scribes\u2014much like a secret number whispered into their ears. The scribes\u2019 response was equally concise: they would proclaim either the appropriate Balance or, if none could be found, the forbidding negative one. This tradition was so vital that its format became law: first, the Aspect would be revealed, and then, the Balance (or negative one) would be declared.\n\nTo illustrate, recall the year that the council decreed an Aspect of ten. The scribes quickly calculated and declared a Balance of forty, allowing the people to form ten rows of forty citizens\u2014filling the square with unity. But when the Aspect was eleven, it was found that no whole number of columns could accommodate all four hundred without leaving some citizens out\u2014so the herald proclaimed negative one, and the crowd understood the arrangement could not be made. In the rare year when the Aspect matched all four hundred, every citizen stood bravely in a single line\u2014the Balance was one\u2014demonstrating Quadratia\u2019s flexibility in tradition.\n\nThus, through clear codes and the wisdom of the scribes, Quadratia\u2019s Ceremony of Alignment continued through the ages, always seeking the most harmonious arrangement, or, when impossible, marking the moment with respectful abstention.",

In their grand library, two revered tomes recorded the Kingdom\u2019s greatest mysteries: the Tome of Multiplicative Growth, and the Ledger of Permissible Sums. Each year, the apprentice mathematicians of the realm were summoned to the Hall of Inquiry to present their mental prowess by solving a challenge dictated by the Council.\n\nEach challenge began with two ancient tokens: the first, gilded with a number of sides, representing the Power Core (whose count was traditionally called N); the second, carved with mysterious runes, denoting the Ladder of Ascension (with M shimmering steps). The task set before the apprentice was to determine the sum of magical energies formed by stacking the Power Core multiplicatively upon itself, starting from a single spark (that is, the sum of one, plus the Power Core raised to the first power, plus the Power Core raised to the second, and so on, until the Ladder\u2019s highest step was reached).\n\nYet, Arithmos had a rule forged in times of calamity: the energies summoned by such sums must never exceed the mystical barrier known as the Billionth Seal, whispered to be 10^9 in the tongues of the Sages. If the total energy remained below or precisely upon this boundary, the apprentice would announce the total aloud; but should the energies surpass this seal, they would instead intone \u201cinf\u201d, signifying a surge beyond mortal reckoning.\n\nTo participate in this rite, an apprentice would approach the Council and declare their tokens as two positive numbers, inscribed on a single scroll in a single line, separated by a space. The Council\u2019s Oracle would then respond with either the safe total energy or, in cases of excess, the word \u201cinf.\u201d All tokens used in the challenge always represented whole numbers, with the Power Core ranging from a single face up to a billion, and the Ladder of Ascension offering as many as a hundred steps.\n\nConsider these tales from the Hall of Inquiry:  \nWhen the tokens declared were \u201c7 3\u201d, the energies accumulated were one, plus seven, plus forty-nine, plus three hundred forty-three, totaling four hundred\u2014a sum safely under the Billionth Seal, and thus the Oracle spoke \u201c400.\u201d  \nWhen the tokens were \u201c1000000 2,\u201d the energies soared to heights unimagined, forming a total of one trillion and one thousand and one, breaching the Billionth Seal; the Oracle rightly responded \u201cinf.\u201d  \nUpon \u201c999999999 1,\u201d the energies were summoned as one, plus nine hundred ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred ninety-nine, combining to exactly one billion and so the Oracle declared \u201c1000000000.\u201d  \nAnd with \u201c998244353 99,\u201d the energies raced well past acceptable bounds, and the Oracle\u2019s answer was again \u201cinf.\u201d\n\nThus, with the tokens in hand and the rules of energy firmly grasped, every aspiring mathematician in Arithmos knew how to approach the Council, recite their tokens, and await the Oracle\u2019s judgment, always striving to summon the greatest energies possible\u2014without ever shattering the Billionth Seal.",

A number becomes good only if it can be represented as the product of a mystical power of two and a perfect square crafted by the squires of Numeria\u2014a unique combination symbolized in arcane scrolls as the multiplication of two raised to some positive strength and a square of another positive number.\n\nOn the eve of Numeria\u2019s Great Census, the High Sage presents a challenge to the mathematicians of the realm. Given a grand limit\u2014let\u2019s call this threshold the Number of Notables, or N\u2014the task is to count how many numbers among the first N citizens are truly \"good,\" according to the ancient definition. The power wielded by the Sages allows N to be as formidable as ten raised to the eighteenth power\u2014thus, the census could stretch across the entire continent of Numeria.\n\nBut what, precisely, makes a number worthy of this accolade? The Sages\u2019 law, handed down through generations, decrees: For a number to join the ranks of the good, there must exist two noble origins\u2014one, a positive count of mystical energy (the power of two), and the other, the legacy of squires (a positive square number)\u2014whose combined strength, when multiplied, forms the number in question. Each possible combination of these origins, so long as their product does not surpass N, is considered a valid pathway to goodness.\n\nThe mission is clear: For any chosen Number of Notables, the seeker must count, completely and efficiently, how many numbers between one and N\u2014including both endpoints\u2014have ever attained the honor of being called good by the Council. The seeker\u2019s report will be a single number: the total tally of such worthy citizens, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nTo seek the truth, a Numerian mathematician listens closely to the Sage\u2019s instructions:\n- The census begins by reading the Number of Notables, N, from the official decree.\n- The mathematician must then report the count of good numbers between one and N (inclusive), inscribing the answer onto the Stone of Tally.\n\nFor guidance, the Sages provide tales from previous censuses:\n- If the Number of Notables is twenty, the tally of good numbers is five. These include the mystical two, the robust four, the powerful eight, the enchanted sixteen, and the peculiar eighteen\u2014each conforming to the sacred heritage.\n- When the census reaches four hundred, the tally leaps to twenty-four, as more numbers can be woven from ever-greater powers and squares.\n- Should the Sages test their counters with the formidable number one billion, two hundred thirty-four million, five hundred sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred ninety, the tally of good numbers swells to forty-two thousand, four hundred thirteen.\n\nAnd so, the mathematicians of Numeria set forth, eager to prove their wit and understanding, ensuring that each census is conducted with both reverence for tradition and an eye for mathematical rigor.",

        "question_title": "Takahashi the Wall Breaker",
        "question_content": "In the bustling realm of Kawamachi, the cityscape is a meticulous tapestry of crisscrossing lanes and daunting stone barricades. Here, streets stretch in perfect order, forming H rows and W columns, each intersection a crossroad of possibility or a stern dead end. The fate of each patch of ground is chronicled in a collection of city records: if a patch is inked with a dot, it is a passable thoroughfare, but if marked with the glyph of a sharp gate, it stands as an impassable wall. The townspeople navigate this world in accordance with these records, for the city\u2019s logic is as relentless as it is precise.\n\nOur protagonist, Takahashi, finds himself at a crossroads\u2014in both the literal and figurative sense\u2014on his quest for the town\u2019s famed eel. He stands at a particular intersection, his starting point, while the fabled fish shop waits at another distant crossing, the destination. Both are fortuitously open paths, not walled off by stone. Every city record details the state of each cell: H of them, each a line of length W, together mapping the city\u2019s navigable arteries and blockades. The journey\u2019s blueprint is thus: Takahashi begins at the intersection corresponding to the A-th row and the B-th column, and his goal awaits at the C-th row and D-th column.\n\nIn traversing this grid of destiny, Takahashi is permitted two actions as often and in any order as he chooses. First, he may walk to any immediately neighboring intersection\u2014north, south, east, or west\u2014so long as it is a passable street and remains within city limits. Second, he wields a mighty martial art known as the \"front kick\": at any crossing, he may unleash this special move in one chosen direction (again, north, south, east, or west), shattering up to two consecutive stone barricades immediately ahead, converting any such walls within those two steps into streets. If his kick falls partly beyond the city\u2019s edge, nothing happens to the world beyond\u2014just as no one can repair what does not exist.\n\nTakahashi\u2019s challenge, then, is to reach the eel emporium by traversing from his starting spot to the shop\u2019s location, using the fewest possible front kicks. Every step taken over open ground costs nothing extra, but each front kick is a measure of effort and must be minimized. The city\u2019s stonework is robust: sometimes a path opens with just a single kick; other times, a series of powerful blows is required to clear the way. In all cases, the quest is to reach the shop with as little kicking as possible, breaking the absolute minimum of barriers necessary.\n\nThe city archivist expects travelers to present their journey plans in a particular format. First, one must announce the city\u2019s dimensions with two numbers: the count of rows and the count of columns. Then, the H city records themselves, each W characters long, describing the street map. Finally, on a single line, four numbers must describe the starting row, starting column, destination row, and destination column, in that order. Upon solving the challenge, the only response demanded is the minimum number of front kicks required to achieve the journey, expressed as a single number.\n\nLet us see how these journeys might unfold in Kawamachi\u2019s logic:\n\n**Example 1:**  \nSuppose the city is a 10-by-10 grid, with roads and walls laid out as per the city records. Takahashi starts at the northernmost, westernmost crossing. Through careful movement, he can reach a certain intersection partway down the map. From there, a single, well-placed front kick to the west blasts away two consecutive walls, opening a new path. Continuing along this freshly cleared route, he arrives at the fish shop. No fewer kicks suffice\u2014so the answer is 1.\n\n**Example 2:**  \nIn a smaller city of two rows and two columns, Takahashi finds that a single front kick to the east smashes the wall barring his way. He then steps into the newly opened street, turns south, and is at his destination. Again, the answer is 1.\n\n**Example 3:**  \nOn a single row with three crossings, only one wall blocks Takahashi from the shop. A front kick suffices to transform the obstacle into a thoroughfare, and he completes his quest in just 1 kick.\n\n**Example 4:**  \nIn a grander city of twenty rows and columns, the labyrinthine streets require him to kick three times, each blast opening up the tangled paths just enough to let him through. Here, the answer is 3.\n\nAnd so, in the city of Kawamachi, every journey to the eel shop is a puzzle of movement and strength, where the measure of success is the number of walls shattered\u2014no more, no less\u2014on the way to dinner.",

        "question_title": "Ringo's Favorite Numbers 3",
        "question_content": "Certainly! Here is the narrative transformation following your guidelines:\n\n---\n\nIn the distant land of Numeria, where numbers are living entities with unique traits and social standings, there exists an elite order known as the Guild of 400s. Membership in this guild is rare and strictly regulated, prized among the numerals for its exclusivity and the peculiar harmony its members possess.\n\nThe Guild\u2019s ancient charter outlines a stringent twofold rite of entry. First, any candidate for the Guild must be the offspring of exactly two noble lineages, each lineage representing a distinct Prime House. No more, no less\u2014too many ancestries, or too few, and the candidate is turned away at the gates. Second, the candidate must inherit their power from each Prime House in pairs: their heritage from each line must come in even measure. That is, if you trace their descent from, say, the House of Duality (the Primes), the number of generations (or times the ancestor is repeated in their lineage) must be neatly even for both.\n\nWithin Numeria, scholars are often tasked with a challenge by the King: given a list of aspirants, each with a standing no higher than a certain threshold decreed by the King (we\u2019ll call this threshold A), you are to determine, as efficiently as possible, which is the most eminent Guild member whose number does not surpass this standing. This task must be performed many times over, for Q different decrees, each with its own threshold, and always the demand is clear: present the most prestigious Guild member not exceeding the threshold, for each decree in turn.\n\nThe rules for input and output are thus set by the Royal Scribes: The first scroll you receive tells you the number of decrees, which is a number not less than one and no more than twice ten to the fifth power. Each of the following scrolls details a threshold\u2014a number never less than thirty-six and never more than ten to the twelfth power. For each decree, you must inscribe on a fresh parchment the name (the numeral) of the highest-ranking Guild of 400 member not exceeding the threshold. The answers must be returned, one per line, in the very order the decrees were presented.\n\nTo make the process clearer, let us observe some examples that have been chronicled in the Royal Annals. Suppose the King raises five decrees, with thresholds of 404, 36, 60, 1000000000000, and 123456789. The answers provided from the Guild\u2019s registry are 400, 36, 36, 1000000000000, and 123454321. For instance, for a threshold of 404, the grand Guild member 400 is the mightiest whose traits fit the Guild\u2019s laws and who does not exceed the decree\u2019s limit, for 400 has only two noble Prime Houses in its lineage (2 and 5), and both contribute an even number of generations (four from the House of Two, and two from the House of Five).\n\nThus, in Numeria, the assignment is clear: interpret each decree, search the ranks of the Guild of 400s, and, using the world\u2019s logic, present the greatest worthy member who fits each threshold. The harmony of lineage and the parity of inheritance are the keys to ascending the ranks of the Guild\u2014and your success in the King\u2019s scholarly test.\n\n---\n\n**Sample Input, as given to the Royal Scribes:**\n\n5  \n404  \n36  \n60  \n1000000000000  \n123456789  \n\n**Corresponding Responses, recorded in the Guild Registry:**\n\n400  \n36  \n36  \n1000000000000  \n123454321  \n\nFor each, the assigned Guild member is chosen by tracing lineage and confirming adherence to the Guild\u2019s ancient charter, as described above.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling kingdom of Gourmandia, where desserts held as much power as noble titles, the most anticipated festival approached: the Great AtCoder Jubilee. To honor this event, Takahashi, the famed patissier of the ABC pastry guild, devised a contest of confectionery artistry. In his shop stood rows of N unique cakes, each imbued with three mystical qualities: their radiant beauty, mouthwatering tastiness, and adoring popularity among patrons. No two cakes were quite alike, and each displayed these virtues as a set of three numbers\u2014each number a positive sign of the cake\u2019s inner magic.\n\nBut there was a twist in this year\u2019s celebration: Takahashi would allow only K honored pairs of cakes to be formally showcased in the grand display. The challenge? To select K pairs of cakes such that no cake appeared in more than one pair. For every pair chosen, their price at the auction would be determined not just by a single trait, but by the greatest sum from any of the three virtues\u2014beauty, tastiness, or popularity\u2014between the cakes in each pair. Thus, the value of each pair was the highest of the combined beauty, tastiness, or popularity between the two cakes; the overall goal was to maximize the sum of these pairwise values across all K pairs.\n\nTo participate in this challenge, aspiring patissiers\u2014and you, the reader\u2014are presented with T distinct cases (each representing a different festival day). For each case, you will receive a parchment with the tale\u2019s details: first, the number of cakes available (denoted by N), and the number of pairs to be formed (K). Then, for every cake, three numbers representing its beauty, tastiness, and popularity will be listed in order. These numbers can be grand (as high as a billion in Gourmandian count), but the number of cakes shall never exceed the magical bound of ten to the fifth power across all the test cases combined, and K shall never be more than half the number of cakes, rounded down.\n\nYour task as the would-be p\u00e2tissier-general is this: For each case, select K pairs of cakes so that none are reused, and the sum of their pairwise auction prices (as defined above) is as high as possible. You must describe, for every festival day, the highest possible total price you can achieve with your chosen pairings. The lore dictates that you answer each case in the order given, with your results to be delivered\u2014one per line\u2014back to the guild.\n\nTo participate, the parchment you receive will be inscribed as follows:\n\n1. At the top, the number of festival days (T).\n2. For each festival day:\n    - A line with the number of cakes (N) and the number of pairs (K);  \n    - Then, N lines follow, each with three numbers, describing a cake\u2019s beauty, tastiness, and popularity.\n\nWhen your calculations are done, you must inscribe your answers\u2014one for each festival day\u2014onto a scroll, with each number on its own line, in the order the days were presented.\n\nFor example, suppose one day\u2019s contest features three cakes:  \nCake 1 has beauty 6, tastiness 3, and popularity 8;  \nCake 2 has beauty 3, tastiness 5, and popularity 0;  \nCake 3 has beauty 2, tastiness 7, and popularity 3.  \nIf you may only form one pair, your best possible score is to pair Cake 2 and Cake 3, whose combined auction value is determined by their sums (beauty: 5, tastiness: 12, popularity: 3), with the price being the greatest\u201412. Thus, your scroll should record \u201c12\u201d as the result for this day.\n\nShould a more elaborate festival arise\u2014say, with five cakes and two pairs to be selected, or six cakes and two pairs\u2014the rules hold: select pairs wisely, always maximizing the sum of their greatest combined virtues, and remember that no cake may stand in more than one pairing.\n\nSo, patissier, gather your wits and your numbers. The fate of Gourmandia\u2019s greatest festival treats rests in your hands\u2014and the final tally of each day, recorded line by line, will declare whether you are worthy of the title: Master of the Jubilee Pairings!",

Along the Grand Avenue, there are N lanterns, each initially unlit\u2014darkness reigning from the first to the N-th post. Once a year, the Lantern Keepers gather to perform M rituals, each ritual granting them strange but precise powers over contiguous stretches of lanterns, guided by the city's ancient rules. The keepers are handed M scrolls, each inscribed with a pair of numbers\u2014known as the left and right boundaries, marking which lanterns may be affected during a ritual.\n\nNow, the customs of Numeria permit three possible acts during each ritual: The first is inaction\u2014doing nothing, which costs nothing. The second is the Rite of Enclosure, whereby every lantern within the prescribed boundary is set aflame for a cost of one golden coin. The third, called the Rite of Exclusion, is subtler; all lanterns outside the specified boundaries are lit instead, again for the price of a single coin. The keepers, however, may only perform one act during each ritual, and each act must relate to its corresponding scroll\u2019s boundaries.\n\nThe festival\u2019s objective is clear: by the end, every lantern along the Grand Avenue must blaze with light, no matter the sequence of actions. The city's chroniclers pose a challenge\u2014can the keepers, using only the M rituals as outlined, illuminate every single lantern? If so, they must also seek to minimize the total number of coins spent, ensuring the city's treasury isn't unduly burdened. Should success be possible, the keepers must present a record of their choices\u2014one act for each ritual\u2014along with the smallest possible total expense.\n\nEach Lantern Keeper receives their instructions in the following form: The first scroll reveals two numbers\u2014the count of lanterns (N, up to a million) and the number of rituals (M, possibly up to two hundred thousand). Then, for each of the M rituals, a new line lists two numbers\u2014marking the starting and ending lanterns that a specific act may affect.\n\nThose seeking to report their triumphs or failures must do so with equal clarity: If it is impossible to have every lantern shining after all rituals, they must declare so with the number -1. If success is within reach, they must instead state the minimal number of coins spent, followed by a precise record of the acts chosen for each ritual, written as a series of numbers\u2014where zero means no action, one means the Rite of Enclosure was used, and two means the Rite of Exclusion was employed.\n\nLet us peer into several tales from the archives:\n\nIn one festival, there were five lanterns and four rituals, with sacred boundaries as follows: the second through fourth lantern, the third through fifth, the first through fourth, and finally the second through fifth. The keepers first used the Rite of Exclusion on the outskirts (lighting only the first and fifth lanterns), then waited during the next ritual, then performed the Rite of Enclosure to light the first four lanterns, and finally waited again. Thus, every lantern glowed, and only two coins were spent. Their report:  \n2  \n2 0 1 0\n\nIn another year, again with five lanterns and four rituals bounded by the first to third, first to fifth, second to fourth, and third to fifth lanterns, the keepers needed only one coin: they waited, then used the Rite of Enclosure to sweep the avenue, and then waited out the last two rituals. Their record:  \n1  \n0 1 0 0\n\nSometimes, all rituals needed to be spent\u2014such as when the five lanterns and two rituals allowed only the first three, then the second through fifth, to be lit directly. Here, the keepers performed the Rite of Enclosure for both rituals, spending two coins:  \n2  \n1 1\n\nYet, fate is not always kind. In a festival with five lanterns and two rituals, whose boundaries spanned the first to third and the second to fourth, it was impossible to light every lantern. The keepers, after much deliberation, had to admit defeat, reporting:  \n-1\n\nThus, the tradition of Numeria continues, a blend of ritual, strategy, and luminous ambition\u2014each festival a puzzle, each solution a triumph of wit over darkness.",

        "question_title": "Basic Grid Problem with Updates",
        "question_content": "In the distant kingdom of Gridiron, generations of sages have studied the ancient Mosaic\u2014a wondrous tablet laid out in a rectangular formation, with N rows from top to bottom and M columns from left to right. Each little square on this Mosaic is inscribed with a sacred number, believed to influence the fate of all who traverse its surface. The numbers are never negative and are always less than the mystical value of 998244353, a sacred modulus known throughout the land.\n\nOne day, a curious traveler named Takahashi arrives. He begins his journey from a certain starting square, determined not by whim but by specific coordinates known only as \u201cthe Sages\u2019 Chosen Row\u201d and \u201cthe Sages\u2019 Chosen Column.\u201d Over Q days, Takahashi will embark on a series of excursions. On each day, he consults the prophecy to determine which direction he must move\u2014left, right, up, or down\u2014always shifting exactly one square in the prescribed direction, never straying beyond the boundaries of the Mosaic. Upon arriving at his new square, Takahashi invokes his magic to overwrite the number there with a freshly chosen value, always within the sacred bounds.\n\nYet, after each such alteration, the sages demand an answer to a profound question. They ask: among all possible enchanted trails that lead from the top-left corner of the Mosaic to its bottom-right\u2014always moving step by step, either one square down or one square right\u2014what is the total sum of the magical products found by multiplying together the numbers inscribed on each trail? This sum, to prevent the universe from overflowing, must be reported modulo 998244353. The number of possible trails for each Mosaic is determined by a special law: for a board with N rows and M columns, there are as many paths as there are combinations of N+M-2 things taken N-1 at a time.\n\nTo satisfy the sages, Takahashi must respond after every day\u2019s change, giving them the latest possible sum as quickly as possible, never faltering or failing, and always with the results calculated within the magical modulus. The challenge is not merely to satisfy the prophecy, but to do so efficiently\u2014no matter how large the Mosaic, how many queries, or how grand the numbers involved.\n\n**How the Sages Communicate:**  \nWhen a challenge is issued, the sages present Takahashi with the following script:  \n- First, they reveal the Mosaic\u2019s size: the number of rows (N) and columns (M).\n- Next, they unveil the starting numbers inscribed on each square, row by row.\n- Then, they declare how many days (Q) Takahashi will journey, along with his starting position.\n- For each day, they pronounce a direction (up, down, left, or right) and the new number to be inscribed.\n\n**How Takahashi Must Reply:**  \nAfter each journey and change, Takahashi must declare the total sum of all magical trail products, as described, with the sum reduced within the modulus.\n\n**Let us illustrate with a tale:**  \nImagine a modest Mosaic, two rows by three columns, with these numbers inscribed:  \n1 2 3  \n4 5 6  \nTakahashi begins at row 2, column 2. On his first day, he climbs upward and inscribes the number 7. On the second, he steps right and writes 8. On the last, he moves left and marks 9. After each of these days, Takahashi must whisper the sum of all magical trail products. The whispers he gives are: 456, 666, and 822.\n\nFor a grander Mosaic, five rows by four columns, and more intricate journeys, Takahashi might receive as input:  \n5 4  \n147015809 294958521 852121867 499798308  \n790350368 404692331 645419803 290531806  \n275766153 896286651 239187926 945049742  \n340760022 236352314 926236110 223464913  \n287023679 590772036 340282357 521075891  \n6 3 1  \nU 344644511  \nR 45812235  \nD 260083498  \nR 781118585  \nL 156297846  \nL 411901560  \nAnd the voices of the sages, in return, must hear these responses from Takahashi: 299123226, 548055393, 810247224, 876210800, 773990840, 506814544.\n\nThus, in Gridiron, the challenge remains: to walk, to write, and to sum the mystical paths\u2014always staying within the laws of the Mosaic and always telling the sages what they seek to know, as quickly and fully as fate allows.",

        "question_content": "Certainly! Here\u2019s your problem, recast as a fantastical narrative that encodes all the rules and constraints, input/output, and examples in a clear, logical, story-driven way:\n\n---\n\nIn the mystical realm of Primoria, there exists a grand Guild of Enchanters who specialize in the art of matrix spellcraft. Their greatest artifact is the Spell Grid: an ancient tablet composed of N rows and N columns, each cell inscribed with a rune. Each rune\u2019s power is a number between zero and one less than a sacred prime, which the enchanters call the \u201cPrime of Power.\u201d This prime, which they simply refer to as \u201cthe p-th blessing,\u201d is known to all guildsfolk and changes from challenge to challenge.\n\nHowever, the spell for which the Spell Grid was designed is incomplete: some runes have faded to zero, losing their potency. According to the sacred customs of Primoria, any rune that has faded (those showing zero) **must** be restored with a replacement energy\u2014a number between one and one less than the \u201cPrime of Power\u201d (inclusive). Every restoration can differ, and with K faded runes, there are precisely (p-1)^K possible ways to restore the Spell Grid\u2019s full might.\n\nOnce the restorations are complete, the enchanters must perform the Ritual of Exaltation: they raise the completed Spell Grid to the p-th blessing\u2014repeating the grid\u2019s magical multiplication exactly p times. But that\u2019s not all: the Guild requires the **sum of the resulting spell matrices**, considering all possible restorations of the faded runes. Each cell\u2019s result must be reported modulo the \u201cPrime of Power,\u201d in line with the strict magical laws of Primoria.\n\nHere\u2019s how an apprentice receives their task and submits their findings:\n\n- **Input:**  \n  The apprentice is handed a scroll beginning with two numbers: the size of the Spell Grid (N) and the value of the Prime of Power (p).  \n  Next, N lines are inscribed, each with N numbers, describing the initial runes of the grid\u2014row by row, rune by rune\u2014where zeros denote faded runes.\n\n- **Output:**  \n  The apprentice must inscribe N lines on a return scroll, each containing N numbers. The i-th line must list, from left to right, the results for the i-th row\u2014each being the sum, modulo the Prime of Power, of that cell\u2019s value in all possible exalted (p-th powered) matrices, after every allowed restoration of the faded runes.\n\n**A few sacred constraints guide the ritual:**  \n\u2014 The Spell Grid may be as small as one-by-one or as grand as a hundred-by-a-hundred.  \n\u2014 The Prime of Power is always a true prime, never less than one and never greater than ten to the ninth power.  \n\u2014 Each rune, whether original or restored, is always a number from zero up to just below the Prime of Power.\n\nLet\u2019s see how this plays out with a few scrolls from the archives:\n\n---\n\n*In the first archived quest:*\n\n> 2 3  \n> 0 1  \n> 0 2\n\nThe apprentice restores each faded rune with a one or a two, for four possible restorations. After channeling the Ritual of Exaltation (cubing each matrix, summing, reducing all values modulo three), the returned scroll reads:\n\n> 0 2  \n> 1 2\n\n*In the second tale:*\n\n> 3 2  \n> 1 0 0  \n> 0 1 0  \n> 0 0 1\n\nHere, every faded rune is filled with a one\u2014since \u201cPrime of Power\u201d is two, there is only one possible restoration for each, and the Ritual\u2019s result is:\n\n> 1 1 1  \n> 1 1 1  \n> 1 1 1\n\n*And for a more grand challenge, the third log describes:*\n\n> 4 13  \n> 0 1 2 0  \n> 3 4 0 5  \n> 0 6 0 7  \n> 8 9 0 0\n\nAfter all possibilities are summoned and the Ritual performed, the apprentice\u2019s answer is:\n\n> 8 0 6 5  \n> 11 1 8 5  \n> 8 0 4 12  \n> 8 0 1 9\n\nSo, young enchanter, when the Guild presents you with a Spell Grid and a Prime of Power, remember: for every way to restore the faded runes, perform the Ritual, sum the results, and report each cell\u2019s answer modulo the Prime. Only then will your scroll return with the Guild\u2019s approval.",

        "question_content": "In the far-flung future of Neo-Panopolis, a city where numbers are more than mere symbols\u2014they\u2019re the lifeblood of commerce, reputation, and power\u2014there exists a tradition called the Game of Recasting. Each citizen is born with a Number Sigil, a sequence of N digits between one and nine, etched onto their virtual identity. Those who seek to rise in status participate in the Grand Exchange, an annual event where contestants are granted a set of M potent Number Tokens (also single digits from one to nine), to be used in a specific order. The goal: to transform their Sigil through skillful substitution, forging the greatest possible number and thus climbing the city\u2019s social hierarchy.\n\nAccording to the ancient rules of the Exchange, the transformation unfolds in M sacred rounds. In each round, the contestant must select exactly one position within their current Number Sigil\u2014any position at all\u2014and inscribe upon it the next available Token from their collection, following the order given. Once a position is changed, its new value remains unless altered again in a subsequent round, and no position may be skipped. Each choice is strategic: the right placement can vastly increase one\u2019s standing, while a poor move may squander a powerful Token.\n\nYour challenge, should you dare to enter the Exchange, is to determine the precise sequence of placements that will yield the highest possible Sigil value by the end of the M rounds. The final Sigil is read as an integer, and every digit counts: the Grand Exchange favors only those who maximize their resulting number through clever substitutions, using every Token exactly once in the given order.\n\nTo participate, the Exchange Master will present you with the following ritual:  \nYou must first announce two numbers, N and M\u2014the length of your original Sigil and the number of Tokens you possess, respectively. Next, you display your initial Sigil (a string of N digits, each from one to nine), followed by your sequence of Tokens (a string of M digits, also from one to nine), both carved into the virtual ledger. When your transformation is complete, you must proclaim the greatest Sigil you could achieve using your Tokens in the prescribed fashion.\n\nFor clarity, here is how the Exchange expects your input and output, woven into the city\u2019s ceremony:\n- **Input:**  \n  First, you proclaim the two numbers N and M.  \n  Next, you reveal your original Sigil as a string of digits.  \n  Finally, you reveal your string of M Tokens, each to be used exactly once in the order given.  \n- **Output:**  \n  You then declare the grandest possible integer Sigil attainable after the M ritual substitutions.\n\nLet the chronicles of past Exchanges provide guidance:\n\n- In one contest, a challenger with an initial Sigil of 191 and Tokens 325 (having N=3 and M=3) found that the optimal path led to the Sigil 593, by replacing the third digit first, then the first, and then the first again.\n- Another brought forth a Sigil of 191 and was granted nine mighty Tokens: 998244353. With careful choices, they shaped their Sigil into 993\u2014the largest number they could forge in three places with nine Tokens.\n- In the grandest tale, a contestant started with Sigil 31415926535 and wielded the sequence 2718281828459. Through strategic substitutions, the masterful Sigil 98888976555 was achieved.\n\nThus, in the city of Neo-Panopolis, the quest is simple: present your numbers and sequences as prescribed, and reveal the loftiest Sigil you can create. The Exchange awaits your answer\u2014will you ascend to glory, or watch another claim the numeric pinnacle?",

        "question_content": "In the faraway realm of Arithmeria, numbers were not mere symbols but living entities, each with its own personality and power. Within this land, there existed a curious tradition known as the Rite of Pairing. This rite was held in the grand Hall of Equilibrium, where sages would gather to solve ancient riddles posed by the Council of Integers. The council would select a particular value\u2014let us call it the \u201cEssence Number\u201d\u2014for each challenge, and the sages\u2019 task was to find an ideal union of two powerful spirits whose mystical bond was governed by rules as old as Arithmeria itself.\n\nThe rules were strict and woven deep into the fabric of their world: Every Essence Number, which always lay between the tiniest spark of life and a towering monolith (from the First to Nth Power, with N as vast as ten to the power of nine), demanded a unique pair of spirits. Both spirits had to possess vitality of their own, each with life force ranging from the smallest flicker up to the monumental strength of ten to the eighteenth. Most importantly, there was a special resonance the council sought: If the first spirit\u2019s energy was raised to the power of some hidden count, then diminished by one, the result had to be wholly absorbed by the second spirit\u2019s aura. The earliest moment this absorption could occur\u2014no sooner, no later\u2014had to match the Essence Number itself.\n\nEach year, the council posed several such riddles\u2014never fewer than one, never more than ten thousand. For every challenge, the Hall of Equilibrium would echo with the solution: a pair of life forces, each named aloud in succession. The input for the rite was simple: the number of riddles to be solved, and for each, the Essence Number to be honored. The output was equally direct\u2014the strength of the first and second spirits, named plainly next to each other, for each challenge.\n\nThe sages of Arithmeria knew that, for any Essence Number, such a pair could always be discovered\u2014sometimes in many different ways. Their task, however, was not only to find any solution, but to do so in harmony with the world\u2019s order and as efficiently as possible, lest the Rite lose its meaning. The council required their answer to be swift and correct, but welcomed any suitable pair, for multiplicity was valued in Arithmeria.\n\nLet us explore how this played out through the council\u2019s own recent challenges. Suppose four riddles were posed, with Essence Numbers three, sixteen, one, and fifty-five. For the first, the sages might declare the pair \u201ctwo and seven\u201d; for the second, \u201celeven and sixty-eight\u201d; for the simplest Essence, \u201ctwenty million two hundred fifty thousand one hundred twenty-six and one\u201d; and for the last, \u201cthirty-three and six hundred sixty-two.\u201d In each case, the sages checked: for the earliest count matching the Essence Number, raising the first spirit\u2019s strength to that count, then reducing by one, the result was indeed wholly claimed by the second spirit, and never before.\n\nThus, the Rite of Pairing continued in Arithmeria, a testament to both the world\u2019s logic and its wonder\u2014where numbers, rules, and the art of wise matching kept harmony in their world. \n\n---\n\n**Input Format in Arithmeria:**  \nFirst, the number of challenges posed by the council.  \nThen, for each challenge, a single Essence Number to honor.\n\n**Output Format:**  \nFor each challenge, announce two positive whole numbers\u2014first the strength of the first spirit, then the second\u2014separated by a space.\n\n**Sample Council Challenge (Input):**\n```\n4\n3\n16\n1\n55\n```\n\n**Sample Sages\u2019 Answers (Output):**\n```\n2 7\n11 68\n20250126 1\n33 662\n```\nIn each case, the chosen spirits fulfilled the council\u2019s resonance: for the first challenge, for example, raising two to the third power and subtracting one yields seven, which is claimed wholly by the second spirit; this harmony occurs for the very first time at the third count, as prescribed by the council.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling realm of Vertica, an intricate land woven together by mysterious pathways, every city is known as a \"vertex,\" each grand and unique, numbered from the first to the N-th. These cities are not isolated; they are interlinked by magical bridges called \"edges,\" which are undirected and connect two distinct cities, forming a network so tightly bound that there is always a way to traverse from any one city to another, no matter how long the journey. The total number of cities in Vertica is known as N, and the magical bridges that connect them are counted as M. For every bridge, the records state exactly which two cities it links.\n\nVertica is home to an age-old tradition\u2014the Great Exchange. Two enchanted relics, known as A and B, are housed separately: relic A resides in city S, while relic B dwells in city T, with S and T being two different cities. Guardians of the Exchange are given a simple yet sacred rule: at any time, they may choose either relic and, using the magic of the bridges, move it from its current city to a neighboring one. However, a dire taboo exists\u2014never may both relics occupy the same city, for the union would unleash chaos upon Vertica.\n\nThe task bestowed upon the guardians is a feat of both coordination and cunning: they must orchestrate a perfect swap, such that relic A ends up in city T, and relic B arrives in city S. The guardians may move either relic in any order, as many times as needed, as long as the sacred taboo is never broken. The quest is to determine whether this swap can be achieved at all, and, if so, to discover the least number of magical moves required to honor the Exchange.\n\nThe stewards of Vertica communicate through scrolls\u2014each task begins with a scroll listing the number of cities (N), the number of bridges (M), and the starting cities of relics A and B (S and T). An archive of M lines follows, each one mapping a single magical bridge between two cities. The guardians must return their answer on another scroll: if the Exchange is impossible, they must inscribe \u201c-1\u201d; otherwise, they must record the smallest number of moves needed to achieve the sacred task.\n\n**Example scrolls from Vertica's annals:**\n\n*In one tale, four cities and four bridges are charted, with relic A in city 3 and relic B in city 4. The bridges connect: city 2 to 4, city 1 to 4, city 3 to 4, and city 2 to 3. Through careful maneuvering\u2014A to city 2, B to city 3, then A to city 4\u2014the Exchange is achieved in three magical moves, the minimal possible.*\n\n*In a smaller fable, only two cities joined by one bridge begin with relic A in city 1 and relic B in city 2. The guardians find, to their dismay, that no sequence of moves respects the taboo; thus, they write \u201c-1\u201d atop the scroll.*\n\n*Another archive chronicles five cities and six bridges, with relics starting in cities 3 and 5. The bridges span cities 1-2, 2-3, 1-5, 2-4, 1-3, and 2-5. Here, the guardians succeed in their Exchange in just four deft moves\u2014again, the swiftest possible.*\n\nThus, the guardians of Vertica preserve their logic in legend: every rule of the world\u2019s network and the sacred Exchange is honored, each path weighed for its efficiency, and every answer inscribed for future generations of puzzle-solvers.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Polyphonia, the annual Festival of Harmony brings together its citizens for a unique challenge known as the \u201cCipher Parade.\u201d Each year, the parade\u2019s route is marked by a sequence of magical lanterns placed in a circle, their lights indicating readiness: a glowing lantern heralds safety (\u201c1\u201d), while a dark one signals a problem spot (\u201c0\u201d). This year, the city\u2019s council\u2014always fascinated by puzzles\u2014has determined that there will be **N** lanterns (where N is at least three and no more than two hundred thousand), and their initial states are recorded in sequence. The lanterns form an unbroken loop around the city\u2014so the lantern after the last is the first again.\n\nTo bring all lanterns aglow, the council has issued a special decree: participants are to don \u201cCipher Capes,\u201d each bearing a string of uppercase letters\u2014one letter per lantern. A string is called \u201charmonious\u201d if, by following the festival\u2019s transformation rites, every dark lantern can eventually be lit, possibly in several steps. The rules for the rites are twofold:  \n1. At any moment, if a participant finds themselves standing at a lantern where their cape shows the sequence **A, R, C** over three consecutive lanterns (starting at the current one), and the current and next lanterns are not yet glowing, they may instantly cause both lanterns to shine.  \n2. Alternatively, if they find **C, R, A** over three consecutive lanterns (with C at their current position), they may once again light up the current and next lanterns.\n\nThe string on the cape wraps around just as the lanterns do\u2014for instance, if someone is at the last lantern, the next spot is the first, and so forth. The ultimate goal: **find out if there exists any possible string (any sequence of uppercase letters, length N) that allows the parade participants, using the above rites as often as needed, to eventually light every lantern.**\n\nFor every attempt, the council announces the number of lanterns and their initial states to the crowd in this manner:  \n*First, the number of lanterns is declared. On the next line, the state (0 for unlit, 1 for lit) of each lantern around the loop is published in order.* Participants must then answer, for each scenario, whether any harmonious string exists that will guarantee all lanterns shine\u2014declaring \u201cYes\u201d if so, or \u201cNo\u201d otherwise. The answer is case-insensitive to the council\u2019s delight.\n\nTo illustrate the tradition, let\u2019s consider some previous festival trials:\n\n**First case:**  \nTwelve lanterns are set as: 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0  \nThe crowd finds that there does exist a harmonious cape\u2014say, embroidered with \u201cRARCARCCRAGC\u201d\u2014enabling the parade to light every lantern by cleverly employing the two rites in sequence. Thus, the answer is **\u201cYes.\u201d**\n\n**Second case:**  \nThree lanterns, all dark: 0, 0, 0  \nHere, no matter what letters adorn the capes, it is impossible to set all lanterns aglow using the described rites. The answer is, therefore, **\u201cNo.\u201d**\n\n**Third case:**  \nTwenty-nine lanterns, all gleaming from the start: 1, 1, 1, \u2026, 1  \nSince every lantern is already shining, any cape, regardless of its embroidery, is harmonious\u2014so the festival\u2019s answer is **\u201cYes.\u201d**\n\nThus, the Cipher Parade continues: for each parade, given the lantern count and their initial states, can there be found a harmonious cape that ensures every dark lantern will one day shine? The fate of the festival\u2019s glow depends on it!",

        "question_content": "In the land of Numeria, two legendary tacticians\u2014Fennec the Fox and Snuke the Stoic\u2014compete in a storied contest known throughout the realm as the **Game of Seals**. Their arena is a line of ancient pedestals, each one crowned with a stack of enchanted stones. The number of pedestals in play is given by the great numeral N, and for each pedestal, a mystic scribe records the tally of stones present: the first pedestal holds a certain number, the second another, and so forth, until all N counts are declared. Each count is a positive whole number, their values whispered by the scribe in sequence at the start of the match. As the contest commences, a sacred scroll titled \"The Registry of Seals\" remains empty and awaits its first entry.\n\nThe rules of this ancient game are simple, if severe. In turn, starting with clever Fennec, each tactician must select any pedestal that still holds at least one stone. They may then remove a single stone from its stack. If the chosen pedestal's number has not yet been recorded in the Registry of Seals, its index is inscribed there\u2014marking it as \"sealed.\" The contest continues with steadfast resolve, each player winnowing down stacks and inscribing unsealed pedestals, until every pedestal\u2014first through Nth\u2014has been sealed. The player who completes the sealing of the final pedestal is honored as victor.\n\nIt is understood in Numeria that, so long as the contest endures, at least one pedestal will always contain stones to remove\u2014no player shall ever be forced to forfeit for lack of moves. Both Fennec and Snuke are titans of strategy, playing with cunning and purpose, each striving not merely to win, but to achieve victory by the most efficient pathway the rules allow.\n\n**In the tongues of the scribes, the contest is announced thus:**\n- The first line spoken aloud is the number N, the count of pedestals.\n- The second line, uttered without pause, lists the number of stones upon each pedestal, in sequence from the first to the Nth.\n**After the contest, the winner\u2019s name is proclaimed\u2014a single word, \u201cFennec\u201d or \u201cSnuke\u201d\u2014the declaration is never mistaken, for the judges heed not the case of the letters.**\n\n**Constraints of the contest, as decreed by Numeria\u2019s council:**\n- The count of pedestals, N, must be at least one and at most twice ten to the fifth power.\n- Every pedestal\u2019s stack of stones must number at least one, and at most one less than ten to the tenth power.\n- All declarations, from the number of pedestals to each stack\u2019s count, must be whole numbers, their truth accepted without question.\n\n**Consider these tales from Numeria\u2019s annals:**\n1. When three pedestals are announced, bearing stacks of one, nine, and two stones respectively, Fennec will claim victory.\n2. Should there be two pedestals with stacks of twenty-five and twenty-nine stones, Snuke will triumph.\n3. And in the case of six pedestals with one, nine, two, twenty-five, two, and nine stones\u2014Snuke again shall claim the laurels.\n\nIn each match, the tacticians weigh their moves with care, for their goal is to be the one who seals the last pedestal, thus achieving glory. Now, traveler, speak the ancient formula\u2014the count of pedestals and the measure of stones\u2014and witness which tactician Numeria\u2019s Game of Seals shall crown as champion.",

It uses a list to keep track of the Registry of Seals and a variable to keep track of the current player. It alternates between Fennec and Snuke, removing a stone from the pedestal with the least number of stones each turn and inscribing the index of the chosen pedestal in the Registry of Seals if it has not been done before.

        "question_content": "In the kingdom of Numeria, a curious tradition was upheld by the wise scholars of the Grand Sequence Guild. Every decade, the guild would host the Festival of Ratios, where participants vied to construct legendary chains of numbers, bound together by a mysterious law: in each chain, every link must relate to the next through a precise product of distinct traits. These traits\u2014always measured as two numbers, neither sharing any common factor except the universal one\u2014when multiplied, must yield a value inscribed on an ancient scroll. The festival's prestige attracts only those with a keen eye for both harmony and uniqueness, for no chain is honored unless its links, taken together, share no factor in common but unity itself.\n\nEach year, the High Mathemagician presides, presenting the rules. For every contest, the number of links in a chain\u2014let\u2019s call it N\u2014was specified, with N at least two but never exceeding a thousand, lest the calculations grow unruly. Then, for every pair of neighboring links in the chain, a sacred value was given: a scroll of N-1 numbers, each between one and a thousand, detailing the required product of the two unique traits (always one from the current link and one from the next) that must connect every step along the chain.\n\nWhat made these chains \"good\" in the eyes of the guild? First, every adjacent pair in the chain must be connected so that the ratio of their traits, when cast in its simplest form, multiplies to yield exactly the prescribed number on the scroll. Second, the entire set of links must be woven without a hidden thread\u2014that is, all numbers in the sequence must be coprime, sharing no common divisor but one.\n\nThe challenge set forth was this: among all possible good chains that respected the sacred scroll and the law of coprimality, sum the products of their traits (that is, multiply together all the numbers in each valid sequence and add up these products across every good sequence). The result, as dictated by ancient custom and to keep the numbers manageable for the Mathemagician\u2019s abacus, was to be reported only after dividing out every complete 998244353, keeping only the remainder.\n\n**Input and Output Customs:**  \nEach seeker would present their case as follows:  \nFirst, announce the number N, the length of the chain.  \nSecond, recite the sequence of N-1 sacred numbers from the scroll, in order.  \nIn response, the sum\u2014calculated as described\u2014would be proclaimed, reduced to its remainder after division by the festival\u2019s modulus: 998244353.\n\nFor example, consider a scroll demanding a chain of six links, with the sacred numbers 1, 9, 2, 2, and 9. Both the chain [2, 2, 18, 9, 18, 2] and its mirror [18, 18, 2, 1, 2, 18] are honored good chains, each with a product of 23328, and among all sixteen good chains that fit the scroll, their combined total is 939634344 after applying the modulus. In a simpler contest, where the scroll asked for just two links connected by the sacred number 9, there are exactly two good chains, each with a product of 9, for a sum of 18. In the grandest festivals, with scrolls of daunting length and variety, the sum could reach heights like 192457116, yet always presented within the bounds of 998244353, as tradition demands.\n\nThus, every festival, the kingdom\u2019s scholars gather, striving to weave the richest tapestry of numbers, respecting the scroll\u2019s decree and the law of one, and ever pursuing the sum that bestows glory upon their house.",

Within this expanse, every intersection\u2014every block\u2014where a cobblestone path might cross, is governed by a set of invisible restrictions placed centuries ago to protect the city\u2019s heart.\n\nThese restrictions are rules as old as the city itself: No one may build nor traverse the blocks that lie within the forbidden central courtyard, a rectangular area whose western wall stands at the L-th column, its eastern at the R-th, the southern limit at the D-th row, and its northern edge at the U-th row. Thus, only blocks outside this forbidden courtyard\u2014either to the west or east of its columns, or to the south or north of its rows\u2014are considered part of the city\u2019s walkable lattice. Every other intersection point remains lost to history, inaccessible to all.\n\nNow, a traveler named Snuke arrives in Kyoto. He is free to choose any block that remains in the city as his starting point. From there, Snuke may journey northward (along the positive y-direction) or eastward (along the positive x-direction) in single steps, one block at a time. However, there is a catch: he must never step off the established blocks of the city\u2014each move must land him on another legitimate block, always outside the forbidden courtyard. Snuke may move as many times as he pleases, or not at all, as long as he respects these boundaries.\n\nYour mission, should you accept it, is to determine just how many unique journeys Snuke could possibly take throughout this city. This includes every possible starting point and every valid sequence of moves, even the choice of not taking a single step. The city\u2019s mathematicians demand that the answer be reported as the remainder when divided by the mystical number 998244353, a prime they hold sacred.\n\nTo consult the spirits, you (the reader) must present the city\u2019s boundaries to the oracle in this order: first the length of the city (W), then the height (H), the west (L) and east (R) borders of the forbidden courtyard, and finally its south (D) and north (U) limits. These six numbers shall be whispered, separated by spaces, in a single line. The oracle will reply with a single number\u2014the total count of Snuke\u2019s possible journeys, following the ancient laws, with the blessing of the modulus.\n\nLet us see how these rules would play out in the city\u2019s chronicles:\n\n- For the city boundaries given as \u201c4 3 1 2 2 3\u201d, the spirits reveal the answer: **192**. Here, all journeys\u2014be they a solitary pause at (3,0), an odyssey weaving from (0,0) to (4,3) by stepping east and then north, or a pair of simple hops from (0,1) to (0,2)\u2014are counted, for a total of 192 possibilities.\n- In another tale, \u201c10 12 4 6 8 11\u201d, the reply is **4519189**, a staggering number of possible paths through a grander and more restricted cityscape.\n- And for the city described by \u201c192 25 0 2 0 9\u201d, the answer is **675935675**, each journey a testament to the traveler\u2019s cunning navigation through Kyoto\u2019s magical lattice.\n\nIn the end, your role is to become the master accountant of Snuke\u2019s potential adventures, transforming city maps and forbidden zones into counts of possibility, always respecting the modulus, and letting the lore of Kyoto\u2019s enchanted lattice guide your journey.",

        "question_title": "Complement Interval Graph",
        "question_content": "In the distant kingdom of Numeria, a grand contest is held every generation to determine the most harmonious journeys across its many provinces. Each of Numeria\u2019s N provinces is ruled by a noble, each overseeing a domain marked by a consecutive range of towers, with the leftmost and rightmost towers numbered uniquely across the land. The power of each noble is measured by a secret number\u2014some are more influential, some less so\u2014all between one and a billion. The wise council, seeking to foster unity, decreed that a noble could only form an alliance with another if their dominions do **not** share a single tower; that is, if their ruled ranges of towers do not overlap at all.\n\nThe council records every noble\u2019s strength and the precise bounds of their rule: the starting and ending towers of each domain. Thus, for each noble, two numbers are known\u2014the first and last towers they oversee. Whenever two nobles have entirely separate domains, a bridge of friendship is forged between their provinces, allowing travel between them.\n\nThis intricate web of alliances forms Numeria\u2019s Map of Separation: each province is a vertex upon the map, and each bridge exists only where dominions are cleanly apart. The council, ever curious, dispatches Q messengers with pairs of scrolls, each scroll bearing the names of two different provinces. For every such pair, the council demands to know if it is possible, by traversing only through the sequence of bridges, to journey from the first province to the second. If such a journey is possible, the council desires the most *harmonious* path\u2014meaning the path that, when adding the power of every province along the way (including the start and end), results in the smallest possible total sum. If no such route exists, the messengers must return with the mark of impossibility.\n\nTo participate in the contest, a scribe must first read the scrolls in Numeria\u2019s defined manner. The royal input table is laid out as follows:  \n- The first line states the number of provinces, called N.  \n- The second line contains the power values of all provinces, in order.  \n- The next N lines each describe a noble\u2019s domain with the numbers of their leftmost and rightmost towers.  \n- The next line gives the number of council queries, Q.  \n- The following Q lines each detail a pair of provinces, the origins and destinations for the messengers.\n\nFor every council query, the scribe must record a line: either the smallest possible harmony value (sum of the powers on the optimal path), or -1 if the journey is impossible. Thus, the answers appear as a sequence of numbers, each on its own line, matching the order of the queries.\n\nLet us consider an example from Numeria. Suppose there are five provinces, with the powers: 5, 1, 4, 2, 2; and their domains shown by the towers:  \n- Province 1: towers 2 to 4  \n- Province 2: towers 1 to 2  \n- Province 3: towers 7 to 8  \n- Province 4: towers 4 to 5  \n- Province 5: towers 2 to 7  \nThree queries follow: province 1 to 4, 4 to 3, and 5 to 2.  \nThe most harmonious journey from province 1 to 4 passes through province 3, with a total power of 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. From 4 to 3, the direct bridge gives a journey value of 2 + 4 = 6. But from province 5 to 2, the provinces are forever separated by their overlapping lands; thus, -1 is recorded.\n\nSo, in Numeria, all sample proclamations might look as follows:  \n**Input:**  \n5  \n5 1 4 2 2  \n2 4  \n1 2  \n7 8  \n4 5  \n2 7  \n3  \n1 4  \n4 3  \n5 2  \n\n**Output:**  \n11  \n6  \n-1  \n\nThus, the council\u2019s challenge is clear: for every pair of provinces, find the most harmonious (smallest total power) journey using only the bridges that cross strictly non-overlapping domains, or declare with confidence when such passage is impossible.",

        "question_content": "Long ago, in the Clockwork City of Numeris\u2014where everything was governed by logic, gears, and bits of binary thought\u2014lived a council of N guardians. Each guardian stood at a fixed station surrounding the great central tower, forming a ring. The tower itself, known as the Pinnacle, watched over all and was considered a node of utmost importance. The guardians communicated through energy links\u2014some fixed, some conditional\u2014according to an ancient binary code inscribed on the city\u2019s master scroll.\n\nAccording to city law, every pair of neighboring guardians (each pair standing next to each other around the ring) was required to maintain a bidirectional energy link, forming a perfect cycle. Furthermore, for each guardian, the scroll dictated whether a special link connected them directly to the Pinnacle. If the binary digit at their position on the scroll was \u201c1,\u201d that link existed; if it was \u201c0,\u201d no such link was forged. No other connections were permitted, for the stability of Numeris depended on these precise arrangements.\n\nNow, the high engineers of the city faced a fascinating challenge. For their annual festival, they wished to record every possible way of assigning a direction to each energy link\u2014choosing, for each, which end would give or receive the energy\u2014across all the links in the city. For each such arrangement, they would then tally, for every guardian and for the Pinnacle, how many links directed energy into them. The engineers sought to know, counting all possible directional assignments, how many distinct patterns of incoming energy counts could be achieved for the entire city\u2014a question of efficiency and diversity in the city\u2019s energetic harmony.\n\nTo assist, they established a protocol for input and output: anyone wishing to simulate the city must first declare the number of guardians on the ring (N), followed by the binary scroll sequence of length N, specifying which guardians are connected to the Pinnacle. The output would be a single number: the total count (taken modulo 998244353, the city\u2019s sacred modulus) of achievable distinct sequences of incoming link counts for the guardians and the Pinnacle.\n\nFor example, when three guardians encircled the Pinnacle and the scroll read \u201c010,\u201d the ancient machine calculated and found there were fourteen unique incoming-energy arrangements possible. For a longer scroll of length twenty, such as \u201c00001100111010100101,\u201d the count soared to 261,339,902\u2014demonstrating the combinatorial richness of Numeris\u2019s link assignments.\n\nThus, the tale of Numeris became a favorite riddle: given a number of guardians and a binary scroll, how many fundamentally distinct energetic harmonies\u2014measured by sequences of incoming links\u2014could the city ever achieve, if every directional possibility is considered? The answer, always stated as a single number, is the very output that every aspiring engineer of Numeris must seek.",

It first initializes a 2D array `dp` of size `(N+1) x 4`, where `N` is the number of guardians. Each element `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to distribute energy to the guardians and the Pinnacle such that the total energy count is `j` modulo 4.\n\nThe program then iterates over each guardian and for each possible energy count `j`, it iterates over each possible energy direction `k` (0 for outgoing energy, 1 for incoming energy). If the scroll specifies that the guardian is connected to the Pinnacle, `k` must be 1.\n\nFor each possible direction `k`, it updates `dp[i+1][(j*2+k)%4]` by adding `dp[i][j]` to it. The new energy count is `(j*2+k)%4`.\n\nFinally, it prints `dp[N][0]`, which represents the number of ways to distribute energy to the guardians and the Pinnacle such that the total energy count is 0 modulo 4.\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(N), where N is the number of guardians. The space complexity is also O(N), due to the 2D array `dp`.\n"

        "question_content": "In the distant land of Binarya, there existed the ancient Puzzle Road\u2014an enigmatic straight pathway, tiled with a grand sequence of *N* magical squares. These squares gleamed under the moonlight, and atop some of them rested sacred tokens, shimmering with power, while others stood empty. The wise sages of Binarya, known for their cryptic challenges, dictated the arrangement of these tokens as a sequence of numbers, where a square with a token gleamed with \u201cone,\u201d and a bare stone whispered \u201czero.\u201d The starting configuration, whispered as the First Scroll, and the desired end configuration, recorded as the Second Scroll, both of *N* symbols, defined the puzzle to be solved.\n\nThe rules of the sages were strict. In a single movement, the puzzle-solver could select any one of the squares\u2014let\u2019s call it the \u201ccalling square.\u201d Upon invocation, every token upon the road would sense the pull of this square. Those to the left would drift rightward by a single square, those to the right would slide left, and any token already at the calling square would stubbornly refuse to budge. This magical operation could be performed as many times as needed\u2014or not at all\u2014always choosing anew which square to summon as the calling square. The ultimate challenge was to transform the arrangement so that every square destined to hold a token (as declared by the sages in the Second Scroll) held at least one, and every other was left empty. The solver\u2019s task was to achieve this transformation using as few operations as possible, or to declare it impossible if fate forbade such an outcome.\n\nTo embark on this journey, a seeker would receive a collection of scrolls\u2014*T* in number. Each scroll revealed a unique puzzle: the length *N* of Puzzle Road, the initial token arrangement (First Scroll), and the desired final arrangement (Second Scroll). The seeker was to solve each in turn. For every puzzle, the seeker must inscribe upon a parchment a single line: if the challenge could not be completed, they must record \u201c-1,\u201d symbolizing impossibility. Otherwise, they must record the minimum number of magical movements required to fulfill the sages\u2019 decree.\n\nThe rules of the land, inscribed on the Grand Obelisk, were as follows:  \nThe number of puzzles *T* could never exceed twice a hundred thousand; each road\u2019s length *N* could stretch as far as a million squares; and the sum of all *N* across the collected puzzles would not surpass a million. The Scrolls always ensured that there was at least one token upon the board at the start and at least one destined for the end\u2014no journey commenced without purpose, nor did it seek a barren conclusion.\n\nWhenever a challenger arrived, the sages would present the puzzles in this manner:  \nFirst, the number of Scrolls *T*.  \nThen, for each puzzle:  \n- The number of squares *N*  \n- The First Scroll: the initial pattern (a line of \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d)  \n- The Second Scroll: the destination pattern (a line of \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d)  \n\nThe seeker\u2019s answer was to be delivered as follows:  \nFor each puzzle, one line.  \n- Write \u201c-1\u201d if no sequence of magical movements could transform the tokens accordingly.  \n- Otherwise, write the least number of movements needed.\n\nLet us illuminate these rules through examples from the Sages\u2019 Records:\n\n**First Puzzle:**  \nThe road has eight squares, with tokens initially on the second, fifth, sixth, and eighth positions. The final vision demands tokens on the fifth, eighth, and seventh squares. After a sequence of three magical invocations (first summoning the fifth square, then the eighth twice), the tokens magically align with the sages\u2019 wishes. Fewer than three movements are impossible, so the answer is \u201c3.\u201d\n\n**Second Puzzle:**  \nA road of three squares with a single token in the middle, but the sages demand tokens upon all three. No sequence of movements can spread the lone token to every square\u2014it is impossible, and so \u201c-1\u201d must be inscribed.\n\n**Third Puzzle:**  \nA longer Puzzle Road, with twenty squares. Through five carefully chosen magical calls, the tokens can be marshaled into the proper positions, matching the destined pattern exactly. Thus, \u201c5\u201d is the solution.\n\nAnd so, the seekers of Binarya set forth, each eager to prove their cunning upon the Puzzle Road, guided by the wisdom and strictures of the ancient sages.",

It then calculates the minimum number of magical movements required to transform the tokens according to the sages' decree. If it's impossible, it prints `-1`. The program uses a for loop to iterate over each square on the Puzzle Road and checks if the initial and final arrangements match.

        "question_content": "In the bustling metropolis of Numeria, an ancient society of archivists known as the Sequencers governs a mysterious vault. At the heart of their rituals lies the Ceremony of Choices, performed every so often when a new procession of values arrives. These values, written as a secret scroll of numbers\u2014one after another\u2014carry the destiny of the vault\u2019s power for that season.\n\nThe Sequencers begin with an empty ledger, a scroll of parchment with nothing inscribed. One by one, as each number on the procession scroll is unveiled, the head archivist faces a solemn choice: either write the revealed number at the end of the ledger, or, if the ledger is not empty, erase the last inscribed number in a swift flourish. Tradition is strict; never may the archivist erase from an already empty ledger, and every value from the procession must be considered, in order, with no skipping.\n\nThe purpose behind these rituals is singular: after all numbers have been faced and every choice made, the sum of the numbers left in the ledger must be as high as fate allows. The Sequencers believe this sum to be a measure of the city\u2019s fortune for the year, so their aim is to choose their actions as wisely as possible, maximizing this sum above all else.\n\nShould you wish to take up the mantle of the archivist and play this game of fate, the elders will hand you a scroll: the first line contains a single symbol, which stands for the number of values in the procession\u2014call it N. The next line is a sequence of N numbers, each value to be faced in turn. After reading and performing the ceremony, you must return only a single answer: the greatest possible sum written in the ledger after the last step, and nothing else.\n\nLet us see how this ceremony unfolds with a few examples from the annals of Numeria:\n\n- When the procession brings six numbers\u20143, -1, -4, 5, -9, and 2\u2014the archivist might choose to inscribe, inscribe, erase, inscribe, inscribe, erase. The final ledger bears 3 and 5, yielding a sum of 8\u2014the best fortune possible.\n- On another day, faced with just a single value, -1, the archivist has no choice but to inscribe it, and so the fortune stands at -1.\n- On one festival, with a long procession of twenty numbers, the most auspicious sum achieved is 369, after carefully weighing each inscribe and erase.\n\nThus, the Ceremony of Choices continues, with the fate of Numeria ever tied to the wisdom and strategy of its Sequencers.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling kingdom of Sorteria, every year, the Royal Parade must be arranged in perfect ascending order. The parade is made up of N honored banners, each emblazoned with a unique number from the first up to N. However, the banners arrive in a random sequence, delivered by mischievous sprites who delight in jumbling their order. The parade master, Takahashi, is tasked with restoring order to this line, but every adjustment comes at a cost: swapping two adjacent banners, specifically the one in the i-th position with the one just after it, requires a tribute equal to the number of the first position involved in the swap. This peculiar rule is a relic of ancient Sorterian tradition\u2014changing the earlier positions in the line is always cheaper than meddling with those further down.\n\nIn more concrete terms, Takahashi can perform as many swaps as he likes, but every time he chooses a spot in the line, anywhere from the first to the second-to-last banner, he must pay a cost equal to that position\u2019s number. The objective is always to order the banners so they display the sequence from the first up to N in perfect ascending fashion, all while paying the **least possible total cost** by carefully planning each swap.\n\nWhen preparing the details of the parade, Takahashi receives a scroll specifying the number of banners, followed by their current order, each separated by a space. The first number on the scroll is the total count of banners, while the sequence that follows describes how the mischievous sprites have arranged them this year. Upon completing his task, Takahashi must announce to the kingdom the smallest total tribute he required to sort the banners properly, using only the rules of adjacent swaps and traditional tributes.\n\nAs a matter of tradition, the kingdom expects the input to be recited as follows:  \n- The first line contains a single number, revealing how many banners stand in the parade (let us call this N).  \n- The second line lists the current order of all N banners, separated by spaces.  \nWhen Takahashi has determined the minimum tribute required to achieve perfect order, he must proclaim this single number to the court as his answer.\n\nLet us consider some chronicles from the kingdom\u2019s archives:\n\n**First Chronicle:**  \nThe scroll reads:  \n3  \n3 2 1  \nTakahashi can swap the first and second banners at a cost of 1, making the order 2 3 1. Then, he swaps the second and third banners at a cost of 2, giving 2 1 3. Finally, he swaps the first and second banners again, costing 1, to achieve 1 2 3. The total tribute is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, which is the least possible.\n\n**Second Chronicle:**  \nThe scroll reads:  \n5  \n2 4 1 3 5  \nTakahashi plans his moves carefully, and the minimum tribute he must pay is 6.\n\n**Third Chronicle:**  \nThe scroll reads:  \n2  \n1 2  \nIn this case, the banners are already in perfect order, so Takahashi declares the tribute as 0.\n\nThus, the tale of the Royal Parade stands as a story of wit and prudence: to restore order at the least cost, following the age-old rules, and to report the solution as a single, resounding number for all of Sorteria to hear.",

        "question_content": "In the sprawling metropolis of Numeria, every citizen possesses a string of magical lanterns, each lantern glowing either with a sapphire (blue) or obsidian (black) flame. The sequence of these lanterns is of the utmost importance, as it determines one\u2019s place in the city\u2019s grand procession. One day, the Grand Summoner mandates that everyone must rearrange their lantern flames to match a sacred pattern\u2014one that is distributed to each household. The catch: changing the hue of any lantern is no trivial matter. Each time someone toggles a lantern, their magical meter ticks, and the toll they must pay is the sum of the costs for every lantern that currently glows sapphire after the change.\n\nThe rules of Numeria are precise: you may flip the color of any single lantern at a time, and after every such twist of fate, you must pay the city\u2019s fee. This fee is not arbitrary; it is calculated by summing up the associated cost for each lantern that currently shines with sapphire. You may repeat this act as often as needed, but your goal is to transform your lantern pattern to exactly match the sacred sequence delivered to your door, all while paying the least total toll to the city\u2019s treasury.\n\nWhen preparing for the ritual, every household receives a scroll with the following instructions:  \nFirst, you will read a single number, representing how many lanterns stretch across your doorframe. Next, you\u2019ll see the initial colors of your lanterns in sequence (where sapphire is inscribed as 1 and obsidian as 0). After that, you\u2019ll find the sacred pattern you must achieve, written in the same code. Finally, you will receive a list of costs\u2014one for each lantern\u2014representing how expensive it is to keep each sapphire flame burning. Once you have completed your ritual, you must inscribe the minimum possible total toll you have paid onto the city\u2019s central ledger.\n\nTo help you envision:  \nSuppose one evening, a household of four lanterns reads the following scroll:  \nFirst, they see the number 4. Their current lanterns burn in the pattern obsidian, sapphire, sapphire, sapphire. The sacred pattern demands sapphire, obsidian, sapphire, obsidian. The costs of bearing sapphire flames are 4, 6, 2, and 9 for the first to fourth lantern, respectively. Through careful planning\u2014first changing the last lantern, then the second, then the first\u2014they can pay tolls of 8, 2, and 6, for a grand total of 16. This is the least they can spend to comply with the ritual.\n\nIn rare cases, some families find their lanterns already match the sacred pattern. If so, they rejoice\u2014for they need not pay anything, and simply record zero in the ledger.\n\nFor the full moon\u2019s procession, all families must report:  \n- The count of their lanterns  \n- Their initial lantern flame pattern (0s and 1s for obsidian and sapphire)  \n- The sacred pattern they must match  \n- The cost for each lantern\u2019s sapphire glow  \nAnd after their ritual, they must write a single number: the minimum toll required to transform their lanterns to the sacred pattern.\n\nSample Rituals:\n- For a scroll reading:  \n  4  \n  0 1 1 1  \n  1 0 1 0  \n  4 6 2 9  \n  The least toll is 16.\n- For a scroll where the patterns already match:  \n  5  \n  1 1 1 1 1  \n  1 1 1 1 1  \n  1 1 1 1 1  \n  The answer is 0\u2014no change required.\n- For a daunting scroll with twenty lanterns and their respective costs:  \n  20  \n  1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0  \n  0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0  \n  52 73 97 72 54 15 79 67 13 55 65 22 36 90 84 46 1 2 27 8  \n  The least toll to satisfy the Summoner is 2867.\n\nThus, the city\u2019s challenge is clear: transform your lanterns to match the sacred pattern, paying as little as possible, and let Numeria shine in perfect harmony.",

Here is the coding problem recast as a narrative, following your guidelines:\n\n---\n\nIn the walled city of Parenthesia, scribes record all royal decrees using a sacred language. This tongue is unique: every decree must be inscribed as a balanced sequence of moon sigils and sun glyphs\u2014each moon (\u201c(\u201d) must be matched with a sun (\u201c)\u201d), following ancient pairing customs. Only strings that reflect this perfect harmony are considered valid and may pass into the royal archive. The archivists have a strict definition: a decree is valid if it is empty, if it surrounds a smaller valid decree with a moon and sun, or if it is the careful joining of two smaller valid decrees, one after the other.\n\nOne day, the High Scribe presents a decree of a certain length\u2014let\u2019s call this number N, which may range from a solitary rune up to a lengthy script of five thousand. The scribe\u2019s string of moon sigils and sun glyphs is always composed as a valid decree, never violating the rules of harmony.\n\nHowever, Parenthesia\u2019s magic allows for a peculiar manipulation: any segment of the decree that itself is harmonious\u2014a valid decree on its own\u2014can be turned inside-out. To do this, the scribes select a stretch of the decree and replace every rune in it with its opposite (moons become suns and vice versa), but in reversed order, so the transformation is not a mere flip but a mystical inversion. This process can be repeated any number of times, on any such valid segment.\n\nYour challenge is to determine\u2014using all the mystical inversions you desire\u2014how many **distinct** decrees can ultimately be produced from the original, following only the sacred rules. Decrees must remain valid at every stage, and you are to count all unique possibilities, modulo the kingdom\u2019s sacred number, 998244353. Seek the **full range of outcomes that can be achieved** through these transformations, not just one or two.\n\nTo enter the contest of scribes, the Keeper of Records will provide the length of the decree (N), followed by the decree itself: a string of moon and sun runes. In reply, you must present a single number: the count of different decrees that might exist in the archive after any sequence of mystical inversions.\n\n**Input to the Archive:**\n- The first line contains an integer, representing the decree\u2019s length (N).\n- The second line contains the original decree: a series of moons and suns, always in harmonious balance.\n\n**Response Expected:**\n- A single integer, indicating the number of distinct decrees that can be reached (always presented as the remainder after dividing by 998244353).\n\nFor instance, suppose the Keeper offers this scroll:\n\n6  \n(())()\n\nTwo unique decrees can be produced in Parenthesia\u2014one is the original, and the other is ()(()), which can be crafted by inverting the entire original decree. But, if given a shorter decree:\n\n2  \n()\n\nThere is no other way to reshape it, so only one outcome is possible. Thus, the scribes would answer \"1\".\n\nThrough these magical inversions, you must enumerate all the distinct harmonious decrees that could ever be written, always respecting the ancient rules.",

It first initializes a 2D array `dp` of size `(N+1) x (N+1)`, where `N` is the length of the decree. The `dp[i][j]` entry represents the number of valid decrees of length `i` with `j` open parentheses. The base case is `dp[0][0] = 1`, as there is one valid decree of length 0 with no open parentheses.\n\nThe program then iterates over each character in the decree. For each character, it updates the `dp` array by considering two cases:\n\n1. If the character is a valid parenthesis, it can be added to an existing valid decree of length `i-1` with `j-1` open parentheses to form a valid decree of length `i` with `j` open parentheses.\n2. If the character is a valid parenthesis, it can be added to an existing valid decree of length `i-2` with `j-2` open parentheses to form a valid decree of length `i` with `j` open parentheses.\n\nThe program finally prints the number of valid decrees of length `N` with `N` open parentheses, which is the answer to the problem. The answer is taken modulo `MOD` to ensure it fits within the range of a 32-bit integer.\n",

        "question_content": "In the distant cyber-metropolis of Bitvale, the denizens speak not with words, but with a sacred binary tongue\u2014a language of lights and shadows, of zeros and ones. Among the towering circuit-trees and glowing neon rivers, two ancient scrolls are revered: the Scroll of Source and the Scroll of Target, each an intricate sequence of illuminated runes. Both scrolls are of the same length\u2014let's call this length N, an immense number that can reach the hundreds of thousands. The runes on the scrolls shine either with a cold, silver light (representing a zero) or a warm, golden glow (representing a one).\n\nWithin the city, there exist two secret arts, only passed between the most nimble-fingered code-scribes. The first, known as the Dance of the Mirror (Operation A), allows a scribe to select a sequence of runes on the Source Scroll\u2014specifically, a cluster of cold runes followed immediately by a cluster of warm runes, where the first cluster\u2019s length is X and the second\u2019s is Y. When performed, this dance transforms the first segment so that all runes become warm and the second so that all become cold. The second art, called the Reversal Waltz (Operation B), allows the opposite: one may select a group of warm runes followed by cold runes (with the first segment\u2019s length Y and the second\u2019s X), then flip the first to all cold and the second to all warm. These arts can be performed at any starting point on the scroll where such clusters exist, and can be enacted as many times\u2014in any order\u2014as the scribe desires.\n\nThe fate of Bitvale now rests on your shoulders. You must determine whether it\u2019s possible, through any sequence of these dances and waltzes, to reshape the Scroll of Source so that it matches the Scroll of Target, rune for rune, from start to finish. While the scrolls may be vast, and the arts restricted to only the allowed cluster lengths, the city\u2019s great Oracle has decreed that the transformation must be as complete and efficient as possible; no unnecessary rituals are to be performed.\n\nFor your guidance, the Oracle presents the protocol for this challenge: you will first be told the length of the scrolls (N), along with the lengths of the clusters required for each dance (X and Y). Then you will be presented with the current sequence of the Scroll of Source, followed by the desired sequence of the Scroll of Target. Your answer must be a single word: \"Yes,\" if the transformation is achievable, or \"No,\" if it is impossible\u2014even through the most artful application of Bitvale\u2019s binary rituals.\n\nLet\u2019s gaze upon the legends of the past for clarity. In one tale, the scrolls were each nine runes long, with the cluster requirements being two and one. The Source Scroll read as a long stretch of cold runes, then warm, then a mix\u2014while the Target Scroll called for a different pattern. Through three intricate performances\u2014first a Dance of the Mirror beginning at the second rune, then a Reversal Waltz at the sixth, and finally another Dance at the third rune\u2014the scribe achieved perfect harmony, and the city rejoiced. In this case, the answer was \"Yes.\" In another, humbler legend, the scrolls were but a single rune in length. The Source shone cold, the Target warm; yet with the arts requiring at least a cluster of one, no transformation could bridge the divide. The verdict, sadly, was \"No.\"\n\nSo, traveler, will you accept the Oracle\u2019s challenge and determine the fate of Bitvale\u2019s sacred scrolls? The legends and laws are before you; the rest depends on your mastery of the binary arts.",

        "question_title": "Twice Subsequence",
        "question_content": "**Background**  \nIn the great Library of Sequentia, ancient scripts are archived on endless shelves. Each script is a scroll inscribed with a series of mystical glyphs, their order carefully preserved. The Grand Archivists, guardians of Sequentia\u2019s wisdom, often receive requests from scholars who seek to find echoes of a particular glyph sequence\u2014let\u2019s call this the \u201cPattern\u201d\u2014within these scrolls. Each pattern is itself a smaller series of glyphs that, if found within a scroll as a \u201chidden path,\u201d reveals secret knowledge.\n\n**Rules and Problem Setting**  \nA scroll is said to possess a hidden path when it is possible to start at the beginning of the scroll, wander forward, and at any point, choose to skip over glyphs or use them in order, so long as the glyphs matched from the pattern are read in their original sequence. The pattern must be found in this way, possibly skipping glyphs, and the path taken through the scroll\u2019s glyphs is always recorded by which positions were used. The scroll is only said to have a \u201cdistinguished echo\u201d of the pattern if that particular path through the scroll is different from another, even if the glyphs matched are the same.\n\n**Task Explanation**  \nThe Council of Archivists has issued a new challenge: given a particular scroll and a requested pattern, determine if the scroll contains at least two distinct hidden paths that echo the pattern. In other words, does the scroll offer two or more different ways to select glyphs, always moving forward and never out of order, to recreate the pattern exactly? The Archivists are not interested in mere existence; they wish to know if the pattern can be found through at least two separable trails among the glyphs, as fully and efficiently as possible.\n\n**Input and Output Format in Narrative**  \nOn a parchment, the scholar is instructed to provide:  \n- First, the total number of glyphs inscribed on the scroll, and the length of the pattern sought.  \n- Next, the sequence of glyphs in the scroll, listed in order.  \n- Finally, the sequence of glyphs in the pattern, also in order.  \nWhen the Archivist completes the search, if two or more distinct hidden paths are found that echo the pattern, they inscribe \u201cYes\u201d on the parchment; otherwise, they write \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n**Examples and Closing**  \nTo make this clearer, let us look at a few scenarios from the library\u2019s records:\n\n- In one instance, a scroll contained four glyphs arranged as 1, 2, 1, 2, and the pattern sought was 1, 2. The Archivists found three different trails: one using the first and second glyphs, one using the first and fourth, and a third using the third and fourth. Since there were at least two, the answer was \u201cYes.\u201d\n- In another case, the scroll was 1, 2, 1, with the pattern again 1, 2. Here, only one unique trail matched: the first and second glyphs. The answer, therefore, was \u201cNo.\u201d\n- Lastly, a scroll with glyphs 1, 1, 2 and a pattern of 2, 1 revealed no hidden paths at all; so, the answer was \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThus, with each challenge, the Archivists sift through the glyphs, tracing paths and echoes, ever in search of knowledge hidden in the patterns of the past.",

The dp table dp[i][j] stores the number of ways to match the first i glyphs of the scroll with the first j glyphs of the pattern. If the i-th glyph of the scroll matches the j-th glyph of the pattern, we can either match the i-th glyph or skip it. If they match, we add the number of ways to match the first i - 1 glyphs with the first j - 1 glyphs to the number of ways to match the first i - 1 glyphs with the first j glyphs. If they don't match, we only have one choice: to either skip the i-th glyph or match it.\n\nFinally, we check if the number of ways to match the entire scroll with the pattern is at least 2. If it is, we print 'Yes'; otherwise, we print 'No'.\n",

It creates a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `1` if there is at least one hidden path that matches the first `i` glyphs of the scroll and the first `j` glyphs of the pattern, and `0` otherwise.\n\nThe base case is `dp[0][0] = 1` because there is one way to match an empty pattern with an empty scroll. For `i > 0`, `dp[i][0] = 1` because there is one way to match an empty pattern with any scroll.\n\nFor `i > 0` and `j > 0`, if the `i`th glyph of the scroll is equal to the `j`th glyph of the pattern, then `dp[i][j]` is `1` if either `dp[i - 1][j - 1]` or `dp[i - 1][j]` is `1`, because we can either match the `j`th glyph of the pattern with the `i`th glyph of the scroll or we can skip the `i`th glyph of the scroll. If the `i`th glyph of the scroll is not equal to the `j`th glyph of the pattern, then `dp[i][j]` is `1` if `dp[i - 1][j]` is `1`, because we can skip the `i`th glyph of the scroll.\n\nFinally, the program prints `'Yes'` if `dp[n][m]` is greater than `1`, where `n` is the number of glyphs in the scroll and `m` is the number of glyphs in the pattern, and `'No'` otherwise.\n",

The `dp` array is used to store the number of distinct hidden paths that can be found up to a certain point in the scroll.

The program then iterates over the scroll and pattern, updating the `dp` and `prefix` arrays accordingly.

It then reads the sequence of glyphs in the scroll and the pattern.\n\nThe dynamic programming table `dp` is initialized with `dp[i][0] = 1` for all `i`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct hidden paths that can be found using the first `i` glyphs of the scroll and the first `j` glyphs of the pattern.\n\nThe program then iterates over each glyph in the scroll and each glyph in the pattern. If the current glyph in the scroll matches the current glyph in the pattern, it adds the number of distinct hidden paths that can be found using the previous glyphs of both the scroll and pattern to the current cell in the table. If the current glyphs in the scroll and pattern do not match, it simply copies the number of distinct hidden paths that can be found using the previous glyphs of the scroll to the current cell in the table.\n\nFinally, the program prints \"Yes\" if there are at least two distinct hidden paths that can be found using all glyphs of both the scroll and pattern, and \"No\" otherwise.\n",

The base case is `dp[0][0] = 1`, which represents the possibility of having found a hidden path (since we have not used any glyphs from the scroll or the pattern). For each glyph in the scroll, we update `dp[i][j]` based on whether the current glyph in the scroll matches the current glyph in the pattern. If they match, we add the number of distinct hidden paths found using the previous glyphs from both the scroll and the pattern.

Each guild presented a line of mysterious chests, their numbers known only as N. Each chest held a secret value, some glowing with known energy, others shrouded in mist, marked with a rune signifying uncertainty. The Artisans called these uncertain chests the \u201clost chests,\u201d for their value was yet to be written, but rumor had it that any non-negative magic could fill them. The Builders, too, had their own set of lost chests.\n\nThe festival\u2019s central challenge was known as the Harmonious Pairing. The rules, ancient as the kingdom itself, were simple yet stringent: Every chest from the Artisans must be paired with a chest from the Builders, such that the total magic in each pair is not only revealed, but also identical across all pairings. The lost chests could be filled with any magic, provided it was non-negative, and the Artisans\u2019 chests could be rearranged in any order before the pairings began. The only restriction was that, in the end, every chest must contain a non-negative magic value, and every pairing must sum to the exact same total.\n\nParticipants were given the specifics of the challenge thus:  \nFirst, the number of chest pairs, N, would be declared.  \nNext, the sequence of the Artisans\u2019 chests, with each chest\u2019s magic revealed or marked as lost.  \nThen, the sequence of the Builders\u2019 chests, following the same pattern.  \nTheir task was to announce to the kingdom whether, through a clever combination of rearrangement and magical restoration, the Harmonious Pairing was possible this year.\n\nTo present their findings, the wise judges required the following:  \nIf it could be done, the answer was to be pronounced as \u201cYes,\u201d reverberating through the marble halls. If not, \u201cNo\u201d would echo in disappointment.\n\nLet us see how this plays out with tales from previous festivals. In one legendary year, there were four pairs of chests: the Artisans\u2019 sequence was 2, 0, lost, 3; the Builders\u2019 was 3, lost, 4, 2. Through careful restoration\u2014filling the third Artisan\u2019s chest with 1 and the second Builder\u2019s chest with 1\u2014and artful rearrangement, a perfect harmony was achieved: every pair summed to 4, and the judges cheered \u201cYes.\u201d In a different year, with three pairs and no lost chests, the sequences 1, 2, 3 and 1, 2, 4 stumped even the cleverest minds\u2014no restoration or rearrangement could achieve perfect synchrony, and so the answer was a somber \u201cNo.\u201d Even with one lost chest in the Artisan\u2019s sequence, the same three-pair arrangement could not be rescued, and again the judges declared \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThus, the challenge of the Harmonious Pairing remains a favorite among the denizens of Numeria, a test not only of patience and logic, but of creativity and hope\u2014a festival of possibilities and, occasionally, impossibilities.",

        "question_content": "In the sprawling Empire of Ten-Billion Tiles, the Grand Board stretched farther than any eye could see\u2014a land divided into countless rows and columns, each square its own little realm. Here, two rival guilds vied for influence: the Red Sentinels, who patrolled the land in strict verticals and horizontals, and the Blue Shadows, whose steps always fell on the mysterious diagonals. Each year, the Council convened with a challenge: could a ring of these agents be arranged across the Board such that each, in turn, could reach the next with a single, signature move\u2014no square occupied by more than one agent, and when the last was set, the circle must close so that the final agent could return to the first in just one leap?\n\nThe Council always specified the trial\u2019s parameters: for each challenge, they announced the number of Red Sentinels and Blue Shadows to be dispatched. Together, their numbers never dipped below two\u2014after all, a true ring requires at least a pair\u2014and the total was never above twice two hundred thousand, the Grand Board\u2019s ancient limit for such contests. The Board\u2019s vastness ensured there was always space, but the real test was whether the agents\u2019 unique ways of moving could knot them into an unbroken cycle.\n\nFor the games, the Council required each team to submit a parchment as proof: first, a declaration of possibility\u2014either \u201cYes,\u201d meaning the ring could indeed be forged, or \u201cNo,\u201d signifying defeat. If \u201cYes,\u201d the parchment must then list each agent and their assigned square in the order they would enter the ring: R for a Red Sentinel or B for a Blue Shadow, followed by their coordinates\u2014row and column\u2014each a whole number from one up to a billion. The path must follow the cosmic rule: each agent, from first to last, must reach the next with a single move of their kind, and the loop must close seamlessly from the last back to the first.\n\nThe Council\u2019s records for each yearly challenge included a tally of test cases, one for each scenario the teams faced. Each parchment began with the count, and for each case, two numbers: the number of Red Sentinels and the number of Blue Shadows. The Council's ciphers, unyielding in their rigidity, required that the Red and Blue numbers were always whole numbers, and that the sum across all test cases never breached the two hundred thousand mark.\n\nFor instance, in a recent set of three Council challenges:  \n- When tasked with two Red Sentinels and three Blue Shadows, the cleverest guild showed how to arrange the agents on specific tiles so each could reach the next, weaving a ring:  \n  Yes  \n  B 2 3  \n  R 3 2  \n  B 2 2  \n  B 3 3  \n  R 2 4  \n  This meant: a Blue Shadow was placed on the second row, third column; a Red Sentinel on the third row, second column; and so on, each able to leap to the next, creating a cycle where the last agent could reach the first in one move.\n\n- In the case with only one Red and one Blue, no such arrangement could be made. The Council\u2019s reply was simply:  \n  No\n\n- When four Red Sentinels and no Blue Shadows were called, the Council accepted this arrangement:  \n  Yes  \n  R 1 1  \n  R 1 2  \n  R 2 2  \n  R 2 1  \n  Here, the Sentinels occupied four squares in a ring, each able to step to the next in a straight line, completing the circle with their unique movement.\n\nThus, the Empire\u2019s yearly challenge was cast: for each scenario, declare \u201cYes\u201d and show a valid ring if it could be made, or \u201cNo\u201d if the laws of movement made it impossible. The wisdom of the Board, the cunning of the guilds, and the code of movement\u2014all came together in the eternal puzzle of the Tiles.",

If all cells can be reached, then a valid ring can be formed. The program reads the number of red and blue agents from the input, and then reads the board configuration. It then checks if a valid ring can be formed for the red agents and the blue agents. If a valid ring can be formed, it prints \"Yes\" and the board configuration. If a valid ring cannot be formed, it prints \"No\".\n",

The BFS is used because it allows us to check all possible paths from a starting point to an end point.

For each test case, it checks if all red and blue agents can reach the next agent in a valid path. If all paths are valid, it prints \"Yes\" and the positions of the agents. Otherwise, it prints \"No\". The positions are 1-indexed.\n",

        "question_content": "In the distant kingdom of Sequentia, the wise Orderlies were renowned for their mastery over enchanted chains of jewels. Each chain consisted of a number of gleaming stones, arranged in a particular order, with each stone bearing a magical symbol. The Orderlies were tasked with a peculiar challenge by the Queen: to make every chain vanish entirely, using the least amount of magical effort possible.\n\nThe magic of Sequentia allowed the Orderlies to manipulate the chains in two specific ways. First, they could invoke the Dance of Shifting, a technique that allowed them to select any pair of neighboring stones (save for the last, as there would be no neighbor to its right), and swap their positions. This could be done as many times and in any order they wished, but each invocation required a moment\u2019s focus. Second, the Orderlies could perform the Vanishing Sweep: if the front of the chain was composed solely of stones with identical symbols\u2014however many such stones there were, as long as this count was at least one\u2014they could make all of them disappear in a single burst of magic, regardless of their count. Their challenge was to use these magics in tandem, as cleverly and efficiently as possible, to erase the chain completely.\n\nThe Queen convened the Orderlies to present them with T enchanted chains, each with its own unique arrangement and length. For every chain, the Orderlies were given a count of how many stones it contained\u2014never fewer than two, and never more than twice the number of thousands that the Queen\u2019s palace could hold. Each stone\u2019s symbol was a number engraved upon it, and these numbers ranged from one up to the length of the chain itself, never exceeding. The Queen\u2019s decree was clear: for each chain, the Orderlies must determine, and then announce, the least number of magical actions\u2014be they Dance of Shifting, Vanishing Sweep, or some combination thereof\u2014needed to make the chain vanish entirely.\n\nThe Queen\u2019s scribes would deliver the challenge as follows: First, a scroll would arrive with a number T, the count of chains to solve. For each chain, another scroll would specify how many stones it contained, followed by a list of the symbols\u2014each a number\u2014engraved on the stones, in the order they appeared. The Orderlies\u2019 response must be swift and precise: for each chain, a single number representing the minimum total magical actions required, each on its own line, matching the order the chains were presented.\n\nFor instance, when the Queen provided three sample chains:\n\n- The first contained five stones with the sequence: 1, 1, 2, 1, 2. By swapping the third and fourth stones, the Orderlies could arrange the front as three identical 1\u2019s, vanish them in a sweep, then vanish the remaining two stones. This required three magical actions in total.\n- The second chain, of length four, bore the symbols 4, 2, 1, 3. Here, no two stones at the front ever matched, so the only way was to vanish each stone individually\u2014four actions, which was as little effort as possible.\n- The third chain, longer at eleven stones, alternated between 1 and 2. With careful shifting, the Orderlies could group like stones at the front and execute a series of vanishing sweeps, requiring eight actions in total.\n\nThus, through their artistry and logical prowess, the Orderlies ensured the Queen\u2019s chains vanished in as few magical moments as the laws of Sequentia allowed\u2014always striving for the most elegant and minimal use of magic, as the Queen demanded.",

The maximum number of stones that can be popped is the maximum number of stones that can be vanished in a single sweep, which is the maximum value of `dp[j] + 1` for all `j` in the stack. The program then pushes the current stone into the stack. The maximum number of magic actions required to vanish all stones in the chain is the maximum value in the `dp` array.\n"

        "question_title": "Random Tree Distance",
        "question_content": "In the heart of the Kingdom of Verdancia, there lies a peculiar tradition among royal archivists. The kingdom is shaped by a mystical network of **N** ancient towns, all connected by secret passageways leading to the capital at the heart, known as the First Town. Each passage between a town and its overseer is marked not by stone, but by magical seals, and each seal holds a distinct mystical power. The magisters have recorded the strengths of these seals in a sacred scroll: for every town numbered from the second up to the N-th, the strength of its seal is inscribed as a number, forming a hidden sequence of powers.\n\nNow, Verdancia\u2019s most enigmatic custom comes into play: the network of towns can be arranged in any fashion, as long as every town (except the First Town) is governed directly by one of its predecessors. The archivists are fascinated with all the possible hierarchies, or \u201ctree-arrangements,\u201d that can be constructed\u2014each corresponding to a unique sequence of overseers. In every valid arrangement, a town\u2019s overseer can be any town that was established before it. And in every passage, the mystical power associated with that connection is drawn directly from the sacred scroll.\n\nThe archivists have been set upon a grand task. For each of the **Q** riddles sent by the queen, they must select two distinct towns and, for every possible legal arrangement of town overseers, calculate the **sum of the magical distances** between these two towns. A magical distance, in Verdancia, means the sum of the powers of the seals along the only path\u2014never revisiting any town\u2014between the two selected towns. The archivists are to answer every riddle as fully as possible, by considering **all possible arrangements** of the overseers, and present their sum for each, not forgetting Verdancia\u2019s mystical law that all answers must be rendered as the remainder after dividing by 998244353.\n\nTo receive a challenge from the queen, a scholar is handed a scroll inscribed as follows: the first line reveals the number of towns (**N**) and the number of riddles (**Q**). The second line is the sacred sequence of seal strengths, listing one number for each town from the second to the N-th. Thereafter, each of the next **Q** lines details a riddle in the form of two distinct town numbers; the goal is to reply to each riddle, on a new line, with the sum of distances between those two towns across all possible arrangements, each sum expressed according to the kingdom\u2019s mystical law.\n\nFor clarity, when the queen\u2019s advisors present a riddle, they might say:  \n\u201cSuppose there are three towns, and two riddles. The scroll reads: seal strengths 1, 1. The riddles are: from Town 1 to Town 2, and from Town 1 to Town 3.\u201d  \nIn this case, the archivists discover two possible arrangements for the overseers. In both, the distance from Town 1 to Town 2 is 1, but for Town 1 to Town 3, the distances are 1 and 2. So, the archivists reply:  \n2  \n3  \n(one for each riddle, since the total distances are 2 and 3, respectively).\n\nAnother time, if there are only two towns and a single seal of strength 100, the only possible riddle\u2014distance from Town 1 to Town 2\u2014yields an answer of 100.\n\nAnd should the scroll describe nine towns and six riddles, with seal strengths and town pairs listed, the archivists will read each riddle, consider all possible arrangements (according to the law of overseers), and for each, calculate and sum the mystical distances, finally presenting each sum as the remainder after dividing by 998244353.\n\nSo, whenever you hear of the archivists poring over riddles by candlelight, know that they are not only solving for the distances in the labyrinthine town network, but doing so in all possible realities\u2014for such is the way of Verdancia\u2019s scholars.",

The program reads the inputs from stdin, runs the algorithm, and writes the output to stdout. The program uses a recursive function `solve` to calculate the sum of the magical distances between two towns. The function uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. The program also uses the `pow` function with a modulus to calculate the power of a number modulo a given modulus. The program uses the `sys.setrecursionlimit` function to set the maximum recursion depth to a large number to handle large inputs. The program uses the `main` function to read the inputs, calculate the sum of the magical distances for each riddle, and write the output.\n",

        "question_content": "**Background**\n\nIn the ancient realm of Numeria, there existed a mystical line of shimmering stones, each inscribed with a unique number, placed in a strict sequence by the wise Scribes. The Scribes called the sequence the \"March of Numbers,\" and the count of these stones in a march was always known\u2014let\u2019s call this count N. The stones\u2019 inscriptions ranged from the humblest 1 to a grand 10^9, and the March could stretch from as few as 2 stones to as many as three hundred thousand. The people of Numeria revered the March, for it was said that only those who truly understood harmony and contrast could unlock its deepest magic.\n\n**Rules and Problem Setting**\n\nAccording to tradition, every festival, the Numerians held a sacred ritual: the \"Dance of Pairs.\" During this dance, the Keeper of Stones would repeatedly select two neighboring stones\u2014only neighbors, never distant ones\u2014and remove them from the line, honoring the bond between adjacent entities. Each removal unleashed a burst of energy, its strength measured by the difference between the numbers carved into the two stones, always counted in positive terms, for the dance cared only for the intensity of difference, not its direction. The ritual continued\u2014pairs removed with each step\u2014until the March dwindled to one stone or none.\n\n**Task Explanation**\n\nThe legend spoke: \"Let the Dance be as lively as possible!\" The Keeper's challenge was to orchestrate the removal of pairs so as to draw forth the greatest possible total energy from the March. To do this, the Keeper could choose any valid sequence of pair removals, always neighbors, always both taken at once. At each step, the Keeper would record the energy released\u2014the absolute difference between the two numbers\u2014and, in the end, sum every burst across all rounds of pairing. The Keeper\u2019s goal: to maximize this total energy, using all the stones as permitted by the dance, until only a lone stone or none remained.\n\n**Input and Output Format**\n\nOn the day of the festival, a messenger would whisper the secret of the March into the Keeper\u2019s ear. First, the number N would be revealed, telling how many stones lay in the sequence. Second, the Keeper would see the sequence itself: a string of N numbers, the value on each stone, listed in their exact order. After performing the Dance of Pairs with utmost skill, the Keeper must proclaim\u2014just once\u2014the greatest sum of energies that could ever be drawn from this March.\n\n**Examples and Closing**\n\nLet\u2019s recount a few tales from the archives of Numeria:\n\n- In one festival, there were four stones lined up as 1, 2, 5, 3. The Keeper first paired the second and third stones (2 and 5), releasing energy worth 3. The remaining stones\u20141 and 3\u2014became neighbors, and were paired next for energy worth 2. The total, 5, was the grandest sum possible, and so 5 was announced.\n- In another tale, seven stones bore the numbers 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2. With clever choices, the Keeper could achieve a total of 14, and none could do better.\n- Yet sometimes the March was tranquil, as with five stones all reading 1. Whichever dance the Keeper chose, every pairing yielded no energy, for all stones were identical; thus, the Keeper pronounced a total of 0.\n\nAnd so, the tradition of the Dance of Pairs continues in Numeria, each festival challenging Keepers to extract the greatest possible energy from their unique March, guided by the rules set forth by their wise ancestors.",

        "question_content": "Long ago, in the land of Tesselara, the great cities were built on endless fields of square stones, each city rising atop a uniquely crafted grid. The Tesselarans, famed for their artistry, laid out these stones\u2014each stone, or tile, displaying one of two mystical patterns. In every city, the streets and alleys formed a perfect rectangle, with numerical records of their height and width carefully stored in age-old tomes. For each city, the chroniclers provided a map: each row of tiles inscribed as a string of runic glyphs\u2014either the glyph for \u2018A\u2019, denoting the tile of crossing winds, or the glyph for \u2018B\u2019, representing the tile of mirrored paths.\n\nThe artisans of Tesselara knew that their artistry was more than skin deep\u2014each tile\u2019s pattern had meaning. A tile inscribed with the \u2018A\u2019 glyph bore a single line linking the midpoints of two neighboring edges\u2014much like a footpath between adjacent districts, able to run North-South, East-West, or slanted as the artisan wished. In contrast, a \u2018B\u2019 tile\u2019s line ran straight and true, always connecting directly opposite sides\u2014like a thoroughfare dividing the city, with only two possible orientations. Each artisan, when placing a tile, could rotate it freely, and so for every \u2018A\u2019 rune on the map, four unique orientations were possible, while for every \u2018B\u2019 rune, there were only two.\n\nBut the city\u2019s grand design required more than just artistry\u2014it demanded connection. When the city was viewed as a seamless world, a torus with no edges, every line in the pattern had to be continuous. No path could end abruptly in a wall, nor could a street begin without meeting another. In Tesselara\u2019s tradition, this meant that for every pair of neighboring stones, the patterns at their shared edges must match: whenever the right side of one tile offered a path, the left side of its neighbor must reciprocate, and likewise for the stones above and below. If a street ended without meeting another, it was a flaw\u2014a dead end forbidden by Tesselaran law.\n\nThe Council of Scribes thus issued a challenge to artisans across Tesselara\u2019s many cities. For every city (each defined by a map with height and width, followed by its rows of runes), determine how many distinct ways the artisans could orient the tiles (choosing among the four or two options as allowed) such that the city\u2019s pattern was flawless\u2014no dead ends, all paths seamlessly continuing around the city\u2019s toroidal expanse. The Scribes decreed that, due to the vastness of possible arrangements, only the remainder when divided by a great prime number (998244353) need be reported. Each map was to be presented as: first, the number of cities, followed by each city\u2019s height and width, and then the map\u2019s rune-rows.\n\nFor clarity, here is how the Scribes would describe the input and output:  \n*On a single scroll, write the number of cities. For each city, record two numbers\u2014the city\u2019s height and width\u2014followed by each row of the city\u2019s tile runes, written as strings of \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019. For every city, inscribe the number of valid tiling arrangements (modulo 998244353) on a separate line, each answer in the order the cities were described.*\n\nAs the artisans pored over the Scribes\u2019 scrolls, they found examples: In one city, a 3-by-3 grid with the runes:\n\nAAB  \nAAB  \nBBB  \n\nthe wise realized there were exactly two ways of orienting the tiles so that every path was complete. In a different 3-by-3 city with the runes:\n\nBBA  \nABA  \nAAB  \n\nthe artisans discovered\u2014alas!\u2014there were no possible arrangements to fulfill the city\u2019s promise. Yet, in a sprawling 3-by-4 metropolis with the runes:\n\nBAAB  \nBABA  \nBBAA  \n\nonce again, exactly two patterns of perfect connectivity could be achieved. Thus, across all of Tesselara, the artisans set about their work\u2014each city, a puzzle to be solved, each arrangement a testament to their craft.",

The state of the dynamic programming is defined as `dp[i][j][k]`, where `i` and `j` are the current position and `k` is the orientation of the tile. The orientation is represented by an integer from 0 to 3, where 0 means the tile is oriented vertically, 1 means it's oriented horizontally, 2 means it's oriented diagonally to the right, and 3 means it's oriented diagonally to the left. The base case is `dp[0][0][0] = 1`. For each tile, if it's an 'A' tile, there are four possible orientations. If it's a 'B' tile, there are two possible orientations. The final answer is the sum of all the states in the last row and the last column. The answer is taken modulo `MOD` to prevent overflow.\n",

It then solves the problem for each city and writes the number of valid tiling arrangements (modulo 998244353) to stdout. The program uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The state of the dynamic programming is defined as `dp[i][j][k]`, where `i` and `j` are the current position and `k` is the orientation of the tile. The orientation is represented by a bitmask where the `i`th bit is set if the tile is oriented vertically. The dynamic programming transition is defined as follows: if the current tile is 'A', then the tile can be oriented horizontally or vertically; if the current tile is 'B', then the tile can only be oriented vertically. The final answer is the sum of all states in the last row and column.\n",

        "question_content": "Certainly! Here is the coding problem retold as a narrative, adhering to your requested guidelines and structure:\n\n---\n\nIn the ancient city of Diragraf, the Grand Council convenes every decade to ensure the unity of its sprawling districts. The city is uniquely structured: its main avenue traces through exactly twice as many districts as there are council elders, each district marked in strict sequence from the first to the last. Along this avenue, secret passageways connect every district to its immediate neighbor, always in the direction from the lower to the higher number.\n\nOn the night of the Unity Festival, a decree is issued: each district is adorned with a single banner, either brilliant white or deep black. The banners are assigned so that, across all districts, there are equally many whites and blacks, distributed as described on a secret scroll. The festival\u2019s ritual demands that each white-bannered district must be partnered with a black-bannered district, forming a sacred pact. For every such pact, a bond is forged: a new passageway is built leading from the white district directly to its black partner.\n\nThe festival's challenge, however, is one of utmost importance. The Grand Council must determine in how many ways the districts can be paired\u2014each white to a black\u2014so that, with all original and newly built passageways, it becomes possible for any traveler to journey from any district to any other, following the allowed directions. The goal is to count all such pairings, and to provide the answer modulo the sacred number of Diragraf: 998244353.\n\nThe festival\u2019s scroll, delivered to the Council, is formatted in this manner: first comes a single number, denoting the number of elders (N, where the city always has exactly twice as many districts), followed by a string composed of exactly twice that number of letters\u2014each letter 'W' or 'B', representing the color of the banner hung by each district in avenue order. The Council must respond with a single number: the count, modulo 998244353, of all valid ways to pair the districts as required, so that the city\u2019s network is as unified as possible.\n\nFor example, when the scroll reads:\n```\n2\nBWBW\n```\nthe city\u2019s four districts show banners as black, white, black, white. Pairing the second and third districts as one pact, and the fourth and first as another, the network becomes truly unified\u2014any district can be reached from any other. No other pairing achieves this, so the Council answers, \u201c1\u201d.\n\nIf, instead, the scroll reads:\n```\n4\nBWWBWBWB\n```\nthen, however the Council tries to pair white and black banners, the passages cannot unify all districts; thus, the response must be \u201c0\u201d.\n\nFor a grander festival, the scroll might read:\n```\n9\nBWWBWBBBWWBWBBWWBW\n```\nand the correct count of proper pairings\u2014those that fully unite the city\u2014is \u201c240792\u201d.\n\nThus, the Council\u2019s charge is clear: given the number of elders and the sequence of banners, count the number of ways to pair districts (each white with one black) and construct passageways so that unity\u2014strong connectedness\u2014is achieved, and report this number modulo 998244353.",

        "question_content": "In the distant land of Linearith, a string of bustling towns stretches from the westernmost outpost to the eastern edge\u2014each town sitting in a neat row, each connected to its immediate neighbors by a winding path. The wise rulers of Linearith have devised a mysterious system for these paths: the \u201cstrength\u201d of each road can be set by decree, and the strength can even be negative, reflecting winds, slopes, or magical currents along the route. The kingdom\u2019s council refers to the number of towns as N, a grand total that may reach as high as four times ten to the fifth, though only the council scribes ever keep count.\n\nEvery so often, travelers from all corners\u2014M in number, never more than twice ten to the fifth\u2014set out on carefully planned pilgrimages from one town to another. Each traveler begins their journey with their \u201cstamina\u201d at zero, determined to reach their distinct destination (never the same as another\u2019s) with exactly the same stamina level: not a single scrap more or less than zero. However, as they walk from their starting point to their destination, they follow the shortest path, and each time they cross a road, their stamina shifts by an amount decreed for that road. At every town they pause at along the way\u2014except, of course, the very first and the very last stop\u2014they demand their stamina be a strictly positive value, a sign of healthy vigor for the journey.\n\nThe council is keen to accommodate these peculiar requirements, for Linearith\u2019s prosperity depends on the happiness of its travelers. However, setting the strengths of the roads is an art, for the demands of one traveler might clash with the needs of another. From time to time, royal inspectors visit with a set of Q queries (often up to twice ten to the fifth!). Each inspector asks: \u201cIs it possible, for a given stretch of travelers\u2014say, from the L-th to the R-th in the scribes\u2019 log\u2014to assign the strengths of the roads so that every one of their requirements is met, all at once?\u201d The council must then answer \u201cYes\u201d if such an assignment is possible, or \u201cNo\u201d if not, for each inspector\u2019s inquiry.\n\nTravelers\u2019 plans and the inspectors\u2019 queries are always presented in an orderly fashion: first, the number of towns, travelers, and inspectors; followed by M pairs of numbers, each indicating the starting and ending towns for a traveler; and then Q pairs of numbers, each marking a segment of travelers\u2019 indices (from L to R) to inspect in that query.\n\nLet us consider a day in Linearith as a case study. Say there are five towns and four travelers with plans as follows: the first departs from town four to town two, the second from one to three, the third from three to five, and the fourth from two to four. Two inspectors arrive: the first wishes to know if the needs of the first three travelers can all be met, and the second asks for travelers two through four. For the first inquiry, the council finds it possible: by assigning the strengths of the four roads to be one, negative one, one, and negative one, each traveler\u2019s stamina rises and falls just as required. For the second group, no such assignment exists that suits everyone, so the answer is \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nOn another occasion\u2014seven towns, six travelers, three inspectors\u2014the council receives six travel plans and three queries. For the first group, demands clash and no assignment works, so \u201cNo\u201d is given. For the second and third groups, careful assignment makes all requirements possible, so the answer is \u201cYes\u201d for each. Thus, in Linearith, much depends on the council\u2019s ability to decode the intricate tangle of competing needs, and their answers\u2014\u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d\u2014determine the fate of every journey.\n\n**Sample Inputs and Outputs, Linearith Style:**  \n*For the first case (five towns, four travelers, and two inspectors):*  \nTravelers: 4\u21922, 1\u21923, 3\u21925, 2\u21924  \nInspectors\u2019 queries: 1\u20133, 2\u20134  \nCouncil\u2019s answers:  \nYes  \nNo  \n\n*For the second case (seven towns, six travelers, and three inspectors):*  \nTravelers: 1\u21925, 2\u21924, 4\u21926, 7\u21921, 5\u21923, 1\u21926  \nInspectors\u2019 queries: 1\u20136, 4\u20134, 2\u20135  \nCouncil\u2019s answers:  \nNo  \nYes  \nYes",
