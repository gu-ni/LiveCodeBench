        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the vast realm known as the Kingdom of Arbor, the land was divided into a network of cities connected by paths. This realm was unique\u2014its cities formed a grand, unbroken chain of alliances, where each city was linked directly or indirectly through a series of trusted messengers along roads. The very nature of these alliances ensured that there were exactly one less paths than cities, creating a perfect web of connections without circles or repeated passages.\n\nThe wise ruler of Arbor sat upon the throne of City One, desiring that every city in the kingdom could be reached with utmost swiftness\u2014specifically, that no messenger should ever take more than two steps to reach any city from the capital. The kingdom\u2019s laws forbade the creation of redundant or invalid roads\u2014no city could have a new road that loops back unto itself, and no pair of cities could be connected by more than one direct road. The maze of paths between cities was rigid but could be enhanced thoughtfully.\n\nYour royal task is thus clear: given the initial arrangement of cities and roads, determine the smallest number of new roads to construct so that from the sovereign\u2019s city, any other city can be reached by at most two messengers passing through one or fewer intermediate cities. This means that if a city is already nearby or just one stop away, no new roads may be needed; but if some cities lie deeper inside the network, strategic construction must bring them closer into the ruler\u2019s immediate circle.\n\nThe kingdom\u2019s scrolls describe the challenge explicitly: first, the number of cities in the realm will be declared on a single parchment line. Then, each subsequent line will detail an existing road by naming the two cities it connects. The existing map guarantees a perfect, cycle-free network adhering to the kingdom\u2019s foundational rule. Your final decree, the single number you shall proclaim, will be the fewest new roads that must be drawn within the laws to ensure swift communication across all cities from City One.\n\nTo illuminate this, consider three kingdoms from the records: In the first, with seven cities linked in an intricate way, the ruler must add two new roads to guarantee all cities lie within two steps from the throne. In the second, all cities are already close allies of the capital city, needing no new roads at all. In the third, a more linear arrangement requires just a single new road branching from City One to unite distant cities quickly. These examples showcase the delicate balance between connectivity and economy in the kingdom\u2019s grand design, fulfilling the sovereign\u2019s longing for efficient governance.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an undirected tree consisting of n vertices. An undirected tree is a connected undirected graph with n - 1 edges.\n\nYour task is to add the minimum number of edges in such a way that the length of the shortest path from the vertex 1 to any other vertex is at most 2. Note that you are not allowed to add loops and multiple edges.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains one integer n (2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe following n - 1 lines contain edges: edge i is given as a pair of vertices u_i, v_i (1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n). It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that there are no loops and multiple edges in the given edges.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of edges you have to add in order to make the shortest distance from the vertex 1 to any other vertex at most 2. Note that you are not allowed to add loops and multiple edges.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n7\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n4 5\n4 6\n5 7\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n\nSample Input 2\n\n7\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 6\n1 7\n\nSample Output 2\n\n0\n\nSample Input 3\n\n7\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n3 5\n3 6\n3 7\n\nSample Output 3\n\n1\n\nNote\nThe tree corresponding to the first example: The answer is 2, some of the possible answers are the following: [(1, 5), (1, 6)], [(1, 4), (1, 7)], [(1, 6), (1, 7)].\n\nThe tree corresponding to the second example: The answer is 0.\n\nThe tree corresponding to the third example: The answer is 1, only one possible way to reach it is to add the edge (1, 3).",

Each index in the list corresponds to a vertex, and the value at that index is a list of its neighbors.\n\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**\n   - It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from vertex 1 (the capital city).\n   - The `visited` array keeps track of visited vertices, and the `level` variable stores the current level in the BFS traversal.\n\n3. **Counting Unreachable Vertices:**\n   - After the BFS, the `visited` array indicates which vertices are reachable from vertex 1 within a distance of 2.\n   - The code iterates through the `visited` array and counts the number of vertices that are not marked as visited. These are the vertices that need new roads to be connected within two steps from vertex 1.\n\n4. **Returning the Minimum Edges:**\n   - The `min_edges` variable stores the count of unreachable vertices, which represents the minimum number of new roads required. The code returns this value.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\n",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the hallowed halls of the Ancient Archive, the Puzzlekeeper guards secrets of numbers not told aloud to the common folk. Legends speak of mystic pairs\u2014two whole numbers\u2014that hold power in their shared harmony of companions, known as divisors. The Puzzlekeeper\u2019s sacred tome challenges any who dare: given many pairs of these numbers, manipulate their hidden prime spirits through ancient rites, so that their count of divisors\u2014those blessed beings born from the prime spirits\u2014become equal, through the fewest possible acts of transformation.\n\nThe prime spirits are the fundamental essence of each number, indivisible and pure. The Puzzlekeeper decrees two sacred rites to alter the numbers: one may summon a prime spirit to multiply with one of the numbers, enhancing its essence; the other may exorcise a single prime spirit, dividing the number by that prime if it dwells within. Yet, one cannot simply change the numbers arbitrarily: all changes must flow through these prime spirits, respecting their indivisible character. The goal is to achieve an equal multitude of divisors for both numbers, such that their divisor counts\u2014fabled measures of numerical harmony\u2014match perfectly.\n\nWithin the archive\u2019s fragmented scrolls, challengers find sequences of pairs\u2014each pair a puzzle to unlock. For each, the Puzzlekeeper demands a sacred utterance: the smallest count of rites needed to balance the divisor forces of the two numbers. The number of such pairs may stretch into the hundreds of thousands, each number standing no greater than a million in power, ensuring both the vastness and subtlety of the magic involved. The challenger must inscribe, line by line, the minimum rituals necessary to equalize the divisor count for each pair, a testament to their mastery over prime spirits.\n\nAmong the ancient parchments, the following riddles were inscribed: Eight pairs, their numerical souls laid bare. One such pair, nine and ten, required but a single rite to bring their divisor harmony into accord\u2014a simple multiplication of prime essence on nine to become twenty-seven. Another pair, a hundred and seventeen, demanded three rites, a more intricate dance of prime spirits to align divisor counts. Some pairs, like seventeen and nineteen, already walked the path of unity with two divisors each, needing no ritual at all. Others, like four and eighteen, required but one transformative step. These examples embody the elegance of the puzzles hidden within the archive, urging challengers to find the path of least resistance.\n\nIn truth, the challenge is as much about insight as it is about endurance: for each line of the scroll holds a pair, and each pair a silent invitation to weave the prime spirits delicately, balancing multiplication and division until divisor counts sing as one. The Archive demands that responses be immediate, each line a whisper back to the puzzle\u2014how many rites must be performed to achieve perfect symmetry? And so, the Puzzlekeeper waits, watching the scrolls being filled with these sacred counts, each a mark of ascended wisdom.\n\nThus, the ancient script of input runs as follows: first, the number of pairs, a single line revealing how many tests fate will grant; followed by that many lines, each bearing two ancient numbers. The answer scroll requires a mirror response: a line for each pair, declaring the minimal number of operations needed to align their divisor counts. Only those who master these rites can unlock the full measure of the Puzzlekeeper\u2019s eternal challenge.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given two positive integers a and b.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the bustling realm of Connectia, a sprawling social network thrives where each user forms unique friendship bridges between others, spanning the vast digital grid of integer-labeled coordinates. These bridges are exclusive paths connecting pairs of individuals, never overlapping on the same exact route, weaving an intricate web across the community. The network prides itself on its vibrant intersections\u2014special hotspots where friendships cross\u2014yet never allows two bridges to lay upon the identical virtual street.\n\nThe great challenge in Connectia is to determine the total number of distinct \u2018check-in\u2019 points on this digital grid that have ever been touched by at least one friendship bridge. Here, a \u2018check-in\u2019 point is a location with whole-number coordinates where a social interaction manifests along a bridge\u2019s path. Every friendship bridge is forged between two uniquely identified users positioned at integer-labeled spots on the grid, and the bridge covers every integral coordinate it crosses between its two endpoints. Despite the complexity and overlaps, no two bridges share the same infinite line, ensuring the network\u2019s paths remain uniquely defined. The community leadership seeks not just to identify these social hotspots, but to count them to understand the breadth of the network\u2019s interactive reach.\n\nTo begin unraveling this, the network council receives an initial number representing how many friendship bridges are under consideration\u2014no greater than a thousand, to keep the analysis manageable but insightful. For each bridge, four integers come forth on their attention scroll: the integral horizontal and vertical positions of its two endpoints. Neither endpoint coincides, guaranteeing each bridge carries a unique connection. The council\u2019s mission is to count, as fully and efficiently as possible, every distinct check-in point touched by any of these friendship bridges, honoring both the sprawling complexity and the uniqueness of each path.\n\nTo communicate the challenge formally within Connectia\u2019s archives: on the opening line, one record holds the total count of bridges. Then, for each bridge, a line appears listing four integral values\u2014the coordinates of its starting and ending users. The response from the council must appear as a single integer recorded on a standalone line\u2014the comprehensive count of all uniquely marked check-in points across all bridges combined. Not a point more, not less. The goal is to capture the full scope of the network\u2019s integrally aligned social reach.\n\nFor instance, consider a scenario with nine friendship bridges weaving through the community at specified coordinates ranging from zero to eleven and dipping into negative ranges as well. Despite overlapping, these bridges together paint a rich social fabric covering forty-two distinct integral coordinate check-in points. Another scenario sees four bridges forming a smaller, tighter weave, collectively marking seven unique check-in spots\u2014each integral coordinate representing a unique moment of social connectivity.\n\nThus, as Connectia\u2019s chronicler, you are tasked to faithfully record and count the vibrant tapestry of friendship bridges, detailing each unique integer coordinate check-in point\u2014a celebration not only of connections but of the digitally mapped heartbeat of the community itself.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given n segments on a Cartesian plane.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\n**Urban Legend Investigator Log: The Enigma of the Echoing Array**\n\nIn the neon-lit labyrinth of the city\u2019s underworld, rumors swirl around a mystical artifact dubbed the Echoing Array. This device consists of a long chain of integer runes, each rune glowing with a numeric essence etched deep into its core. The length of this chain stretches anywhere from a humble few dozen shadows to a sprawling million-followers strong, always vast enough to demand respect but bounded by the city\u2019s arcane laws. Alongside it lies a secret parameter, the Key of Separation, a number that humbly asserts itself at no less than two and no more than the length of the array itself. This Key governs how the runes\u2019 resonances collide and reshape in the city\u2019s ongoing dance of numbers.\n\nThe system works on a ritual: at every cycle, the Echoing Array merges into a new pattern by comparing pairs of runes spaced apart by the Key. For each pair in the array, the less luminous rune is replaced by the higher glow of its partner farther along the chain, effectively filtering the brightness upwards. This transformation whittles down the chain, creating a shorter line of runes that carries only the brightest echoes born from these pairings. This cycle repeats, each iteration reducing the line further until only a single rune remains, radiating pure essence\u2014the final whisper in this numeric saga. The catch, and the city\u2019s masterstroke, is that each cycle\u2019s collective intensity\u2014the sum of luminous runes before the transformation\u2014is meticulously recorded. Yet, with each such tally growing beyond ordinary comprehension, the city decrees it must always fold back into the range of a grand magic number: one billion plus seven, the sacred Modulus Keeper.\n\nYour mission, as the city\u2019s chosen investigator, is to testify this process. Starting with the initial runes\u2019 sequence and that vital Key of Separation, you must trace the transformation cycles to their somber end. At each stage, gather the total brilliance of the runes before their reshaping, then carefully condense this sum by invoking the Modulus Keeper\u2019s law to keep the number within bounds. The ultimate goal is to unveil the grand sum of all these recorded intensities across every reshaping cycle, a sum that speaks of the Echoing Array\u2019s hidden power most fully and efficiently, obeying the city\u2019s unbreakable numeric edicts.\n\nYour investigation record accepts the account in two lines: the first line breathes in the total count of runes and the Key of Separation \u2014 two integers stark in their simplicity but immense in consequence (with the runes numbering anywhere up to a million, and the Key chosen with care between two and that number). On the very next line, you gather the list of luminance values for each rune, each a whole number glowing between one and a billion. Your final declaration, passionate and precise, will be a single number: the grand total of all recorded intensities, rendered respectfully as the remainder after division by the city\u2019s sacred Modulus Keeper (that is, after taking that total and folding it into the range of one billion plus seven).\n\nTo illustrate: when the Echoing Array harbors just three runes glowing with nine, one, and ten respectively and the Key of Separation calls for two, the first cycle\u2019s total glow sums to nineteen as the array filters down to runes nine and ten. Next, these two runes combine to a single rune of ten, adding another ten to the tally. The final rune alone shines with no further echoes, adding nothing more. Together, the grand total reveals itself as twenty-nine under the Modulus Keeper\u2019s watchful gaze.\n\nAnother whisper from the city tells of a longer chain: five runes bright with five, eight, seven, one, and nine, united by a Key of Separation of three. The ritual unveils a first sum of twenty-five before collapsing their group into three lesser runes glowing eight, eight, and nine. A second sum of nine follows as these runes finally merge to one alone glowing nine, who adds no further illumination. This culminates in a grand repeated echo, a total of thirty-four, celebrated beneath the same numeric sentinel.\n\nWith your meticulous notes preserved and numbers bound by the arcane rules, may your journey shed light on the city\u2019s deepest numeric legend \u2014 the elusive truth embedded in the Echoing Array\u2019s eternal transformation.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nGiven an array a of n integers and an integer k (2 \\le k \\le n), where each element of the array is denoted by a_i (0 \\le i < n).

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the swirling cosmos of the Xyloxi Quadrant, the Alien Zoo Containment Manual governs the care and management of the most peculiar life form\u2014the Celestial Myriad Tree. This entity is no ordinary plant; it branches and connects uniquely, such that between any two verdant nodes\u2014each glowing with life\u2014there exists exactly one serene pathway. The keepers of this cosmic sanctuary are bound by strict laws to organize these pathways into special sets called *k-valid constellations*, reflecting the harmonious grouping of glowing nodes.\n\nA *k-valid constellation* is a collection of simple glowing trails, each traversing precisely k nodes within the Myriad Tree's vast expanse. The sacred mandate demands that no glowing node languishes within more than one such trail in the set\u2014not even as a fleeting endpoint\u2014ensuring pure and exclusive light journeys. Thus, each star-like node is reserved to a solitary path, and each path illuminates exactly k distinct nodes, no more, no less.\n\nYour cosmic task, as the Master Keeper of the Galactic Gardens, is to determine, for each possible size k (from the smallest glow, which is a single node, up to the full spectrum of nodes in your tree), the greatest constellation of k-node paths you can arrange in the Myriad Tree without breaking the sacred rules of exclusive node assignment and exact path length. You will receive a precise description of your tree: the number of glowing nodes you have in your care, followed by the pairs of star nodes that connect through luminous tendrils. The structure is guaranteed to be one grand Celestial Myriad Tree\u2014no loops or missing beams, just intricate, singular routes connecting every pair.\n\nWhen you make your declaration to the Galactic Council, you must present the greatest numbers\u2014a cascade of outcomes for each k in turn, starting from the solitary node paths and culminating at the paths that span every single node. Each number on its own line will tell how many k-node trails you can weave simultaneously without overlap, illuminating the grand potential of your containment magic.\n\nConsider the first of the council\u2019s sample Myriad Trees, where seven nodes align in a linear radiant beam. Here, each single-node path reflects seven singular sparks; pairing nodes creates three shining doubles; triplets manifest as two glowing triads; and as the path length grows to capture more of the tree's glow, your viable constellations shrink until only one path remains faithful for any length beyond three. The cosmic balance is reflected precisely in these numbers: seven, three, two, one, one, one, one.\n\nIn another instance, the council presents a more branched Myriad Tree with six nodes, where connections weave more complex luminous trails. The finest alignment garners six single-node paths, descending gracefully as you require longer paths\u2014two pairs, two triplets, one quadruplet, a solitary five-node trail, and curiously, no sextuplet constellation can be summoned. This scenario demonstrates the dynamic challenge of the containment: the careful partitioning of nodes into non-overlapping k longs paths, jewel-like and distinct.\n\nThus, your looming cosmic challenge is clear: chart the fullest, richest constellations of k-length glowing paths within your vast Celestial Myriad Tree, respecting the sacred exclusivity of each glowing node, and reveal the maximal number of such luminous trails for every k from one to the total nodes entrusted to your care.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nA tree is an undirected graph with exactly one simple path between each pair of vertices. We call a set of simple paths k-valid if each vertex of the tree belongs to no more than one of these paths (including endpoints) and each path consists of exactly k vertices.\n\nYou are given a tree with n vertices. For each k from 1 to n inclusive find what is the maximum possible size of a k-valid set of simple paths.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 \\le n \\le 100\\,000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThen following n - 1 lines describe the tree, each of them contains two integers v, u (1 \\le v, u \\le n)\u00a0\u2014 endpoints of the corresponding edge.\n\nIt is guaranteed, that the given graph is a tree.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput n numbers, the i-th of which is the maximum possible number of paths in an i-valid set of paths.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n7\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6\n6 7\n\nSample Output 1\n\n7\n3\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\nSample Input 2\n\n6\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n1 5\n5 6\n\nSample Output 2\n\n6\n2\n2\n1\n1\n0\n\nNote\nOne way to achieve the optimal number of paths for the second sample is illustrated in the following picture:",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nWelcome to the grand tournament of the **Eldritch Forest Realm**, a board game where noble clans vie for harmony among the ancient roots. The grand arena is shaped like a sprawling network of sacred stones, each stone representing a sacred vertex where clans stake their claim. There are exactly _N_ such stones, connected by mystical pathways weaving through the forest, forming a tangle so pure that it never loops back onto itself\u2014each stone linked to others, forming a perfectly tree-like map of the realm.\n\nAmong these stones, some stand isolated on the edge of the network, near the forest\u2019s boundary\u2014the legendary leaves of the realm\u2014each touching only one other stone. The essence of the game revolves around grouping these solitary leaf stones into harmonious circles known as **beautiful sets**. To maintain peace, the path measured by the number of mystical links between any two leaves in the same circle cannot exceed a sacred limit _K_. This mystical constraint ensures that members of a circle stay close enough to share their ancient wisdom without discord.\n\nYour challenge in this tournament is to divide all leaf stones among the fewest possible beautiful circles so that every circle respects this closeness rule: no two leaves in a circle may be separated by more than the allowed number of steps along the forest\u2019s veins. Each leaf may belong to one\u2014and only one\u2014circle, and all leaves must be accounted for. The purpose is not merely to follow these rules but to do so most efficiently, minimizing the number of circles you summon.\n\nThe realm\u2019s record-keepers will first reveal the number of stones _N_ and the sacred closeness threshold _K_ on one scroll, followed by _N-1_ scrolls depicting the mystical links\u2014each naming two stones connected by a pathway. It\u2019s known without doubt that these pathways form a single connected forest with no forbidden loops. Your quest is to declare the smallest number of beautiful circles needed so that the realm\u2019s harmony remains absolute.\n\nTo illustrate, in the grand illustration of the first scenario, nine stones are interconnected, with the threshold _K_ set to three steps. Here, the leaves can be grouped into just two peaceful circles, ensuring no leaf feels distant beyond the sacred limit. In another contest, five stones aligned in a chain require two circles under the same closeness rule. Yet, when six leaves all sprout directly from one central stone and the closeness limit tightens to just one step, each leaf must stand alone\u2014five circles summoned in total.\n\nPrepare your strategies well, noble clansman, and may your grouping lead the realm to everlasting tranquility.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an undirected tree, consisting of n vertices.\n\nThe vertex is called a leaf if it has exactly one vertex adjacent to it.\n\nThe distance between some pair of vertices is the number of edges in the shortest path between them.\n\nLet's call some set of leaves beautiful if the maximum distance between any pair of leaves in it is less or equal to k.\n\nYou want to split all leaves into non-intersecting beautiful sets. What is the minimal number of sets in such a split?\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (3 \\le n \\le 10^6, 1 \\le k \\le 10^6) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree and the maximum distance between any pair of leaves in each beautiful set.\n\nEach of the next n - 1 lines contains two integers v_i and u_i (1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n) \u2014 the description of the i-th edge.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimal number of beautiful sets the split can have.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n9 3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 6\n6 7\n6 8\n3 9\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n\nSample Output 2\n\n2\n\nSample Input 3\n\n6 1\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n1 5\n1 6\n\nSample Output 3\n\n5\n\nNote\nHere is the graph for the first example:",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the mystical land of Sugaria, famed for its enchanting Candy Factories, a wondrous contest stirs the curiosity of every confectionery wizard. Among their cherished treasures lie two enchanted satchels, each filled with uniquely numbered candy tokens. These tokens, glowing with magic, together hold every number starting from zero up to one less than a grand magical number, known as the Modulus. The satchels have no number in common, for the tokens carefully avoid overlapping like sworn rivals. The first satchel holds a special number of candies, not too few but not more than two hundred thousand, and the Modulus is a vast number\u2014so gigantic it could be nearly a billion\u2014yet always larger than the total candies from the first satchel.  \n\nThe rules of the contest are curious: the candy master, Ajs, will draw exactly one token from the first satchel, and exactly one from the second. Upon adding their magical values together, an invisible mystical seal wraps the sum around the grand number, meaning the total is always measured by how far it lands when counted in cycles of this Modulus. The grand challenge is knowing which magical totals\u2014called residues\u2014cannot be conjured no matter how clever Ajs is at choosing pairs from the two bags. The second satchel\u2019s candies, while unseen initially, must be precisely those magical numbers missing from the first satchel, completing the entire collection from zero up to just before the grand Modulus.  \n\nAjs\u2019s quest is to determine the count of these impossible magical totals that elude all combinations of pairs, as well as to identify each one by their shining residue numbers in ascending order. This is not simply a question of finding some unreachable totals but of uncovering every last one, offering the candy master unparalleled knowledge about the full spectrum of magical sums achievable or forever out of reach through the blend of these two distinct satchels. Thus, the task demands a precise reveal: first, how many such residues lie beyond reach, and second, if any exist, their full listing in a tidy, ordered line for the grand council to review.\n\nThe magical parchment that Ajs reads from sets the scene: on the first line, two mighty numbers are handed down\u2014the amount of enchanted candies kept in the first satchel, followed by the grand magical Modulus under which the candy sums are understood. On the next scroll line, the very candies of the first satchel are spelled out, in strictly ascending sequence, each a unique token less than the grand Modulus. Ajs must then, using the rules of Sugaria\u2019s magical arithmetic, produce the secrets: the count of unreachable residues hidden in this world, and if any such residues exist, their pristine sequence in a line that mirrors the scroll\u2019s format.\n\nConsider the tale of the first magical test: the first satchel held exactly two candies, bearing the numbers three and four, while the Modulus was five. From these, pulling pairs and summing them in the realm modulo five, every residue except one\u2014two\u2014could be summoned. The residues zero, one, three, and four all sang their accessible tunes through combinations like four paired with one, or three paired with zero. Yet the clever residue two remained unattainable, a whispered secret beyond the grasp of Ajs\u2019s mystical sums.\n\nIn a grander tale, another scroll bore a first satchel filled with four tokens\u2014five, twenty-five, one hundred twenty-five, and six hundred twenty-five\u2014with the Modulus stretching up to a billion. In this immense realm, every residue from zero up to nearly a billion danced within reach, crafted from impossible pairings of first and second satchel tokens. Thus, no forbidden magical sums barred the way, and Ajs\u2019s quest revealed a complete domain of attainable residues, their count resolutely zero.\n\nThrough this enchanting challenge, Ajs teaches us the magic woven tightly into numbers and how even vast realms obey delicate rules. The candy tokens, the satchels, and the grand Modulus form a tapestry where some sums bloom fully, and a chosen few remain forever elusive, their secrets guarded by Sugaria\u2019s mystical arithmetic.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nEverybody seems to think that the Martians are green, but it turns out they are metallic pink and fat. Ajs has two bags of distinct nonnegative integers. The bags are disjoint, and the union of the sets of numbers in the bags is \\{0,1,\u2026,M-1\\}, for some positive integer M. Ajs draws a number from the first bag and a number from the second bag, and then sums them modulo M.\n\nWhat are the residues modulo M that Ajs cannot obtain with this action?\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two positive integer N (1 \\leq N \\leq 200\\,000) and M (N+1 \\leq M \\leq 10^{9}), denoting the number of the elements in the first bag and the modulus, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains N nonnegative integers a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_N (0 \\leq a_1<a_2< \\ldots< a_N<M), the contents of the first bag.\n\nOutput Format\nIn the first line, output the cardinality K of the set of residues modulo M which Ajs cannot obtain.\n\nIn the second line of the output, print K space-separated integers greater or equal than zero and less than M, which represent the residues Ajs cannot obtain. The outputs should be sorted in increasing order of magnitude. If K=0, do not output the second line.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n2 5\n3 4\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\n2\n\nSample Input 2\n\n4 1000000000\n5 25 125 625\n\nSample Output 2\n\n0\n\nSample Input 3\n\n2 4\n1 3\n\nSample Output 3\n\n2\n0 2\n\nNote\nIn the first sample, the first bag and the second bag contain \\{3,4\\} and \\{0,1,2\\}, respectively. Ajs can obtain every residue modulo 5 except the residue 2: 4+1 \\equiv 0, \\, 4+2 \\equiv 1, \\, 3+0 \\equiv 3, \\, 3+1 \\equiv 4 modulo 5. One can check that there is no choice of elements from the first and the second bag which sum to 2 modulo 5.\n\nIn the second sample, the contents of the first bag are \\{5,25,125,625\\}, while the second bag contains all other nonnegative integers with at most 9 decimal digits. Every residue modulo 1\\,000\\,000\\,000 can be obtained as a sum of an element in the first bag and an element in the second bag.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the shadowy corridors of TitanCorp, a clandestine network of operatives mapped out the labyrinthine connections between their most critical outposts. These nodes\u2014each representing a key corporate asset\u2014were interconnected by secret channels of varying security levels, with transmission costs reflecting how difficult or risky it was to send information along these paths. The entire system formed an intricate web linking a grand total of N strategic points interconnected by M covert channels. Importantly, while the connections were plentiful, the network was almost minimally tangled: the total number of extra links beyond a simple chain was no more than twenty, ensuring the system maintained a delicate balance between redundancy and stealth.\n\nThe operational constraints were stringent. Each connection uniquely linked two distinct outposts; no overlapping tunnels or self-referential loops existed to confuse analysis. Their security ratings \u2014 encoded as weights \u2014 ranged widely, representing the varying effort required to traverse between two points securely. TitanCorp promised that this network was fully connected, meaning from any outpost, a path existed to any other, ensuring the operatives could always find a secret route through the shadows.\n\nAmid a surge in intelligence activities, the control center was inundated with countless urgent requests \u2014 queries demanding the shortest, safest transmission paths between pairs of outposts. For each inquiry, operatives disclosed two points in the network, and the analysts had to rapidly deduce the minimal cumulative risk of navigating between them. The challenge was to handle up to Q such requests, each seeking a path not just feasible, but optimized to minimize exposure or delay, illustrating TitanCorp\u2019s priority of efficiency under tight constraints.\n\nThe transmission reports were streamed into the system in an exacting format: first, the number of outposts and secret channels were declared on a single line, followed by M lines detailing each connection\u2019s endpoints and their respective security rating. Next came an integer marking the number of queries. Shifting focus, the subsequent Q lines each specified a pair of points requiring immediate risk assessment. For every question posed, TitanCorp\u2019s analysts would return a single number\u2014the smallest known cumulative security cost between the two designated outposts\u2014rendering invisible the complex dance of calculations under their command.\n\nConsider the case of a simpler network of three outposts connected through three channels, where the risk levels were 3, 1, and 5 respectively. Requests for transmissions between various pairs revealed shortest paths of risk 3, 4, and 1, each revealing insights into the structural vulnerability or strength of the system. In a more extensive web of eight outposts and thirteen channels, queries revealed nuanced risk profiles, ranging from 1 to 7, reinforcing the critical insight that even a heavily connected network\u2019s minimal cost pathways could be swiftly unearthed by the operation\u2019s meticulous logic and covert computations.\n\nThus, in the silence of the command room, every query answered was another thread tightened in TitanCorp\u2019s veil of secrecy, securing the empire\u2019s dominion by mastering the art of subtle and efficient information flow along the hidden arteries of their corporate network.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a weighed undirected connected graph, consisting of n vertices and m edges.\n\nYou should answer q queries, the i-th query is to find the shortest distance between vertices u_i and v_i.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \\le n, m \\le 10^5, m - n \\le 20) \u2014 the number of vertices and edges in the graph.\n\nNext m lines contain the edges: the i-th edge is a triple of integers v_i, u_i, d_i (1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n, 1 \\le d_i \\le 10^9, u_i \\neq v_i). This triple means that there is an edge between vertices u_i and v_i of weight d_i. It is guaranteed that graph contains no self-loops and multiple edges.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer q (1 \\le q \\le 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nEach of the next q lines contains two integers u_i and v_i (1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le n) \u2014 descriptions of the queries.\n\nPay attention to the restriction m - n \\le 20.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint q lines.\n\nThe i-th line should contain the answer to the i-th query \u2014 the shortest distance between vertices u_i and v_i.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 3\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n3 1 5\n3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3\n4\n1\n\nSample Input 2\n\n8 13\n1 2 4\n2 3 6\n3 4 1\n4 5 12\n5 6 3\n6 7 8\n7 8 7\n1 4 1\n1 8 3\n2 6 9\n2 7 1\n4 6 3\n6 8 2\n8\n1 5\n1 7\n2 3\n2 8\n3 7\n3 4\n6 8\n7 8\n\nSample Output 2\n\n7\n5\n6\n7\n7\n1\n2\n7",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the ancient land of Numeria, hidden for millennia beneath layers of time, a sacred ritual governed by legendary elders is performed when a tribe seeks harmony among their enchanted stones. Each tribe member holds a string of stones\u2014some shimmering with special numbers\u2014arranged in a mystical line of length as vast as the greatest of Numerian counts, no fewer than one and up to five hundred thousand in number. The stones\u2019 numbers range widely but remain within this monumental scale, representing values known and cataloged by the elders.\n\nThe ritual unfolds under solemn laws: the tribe may select one continuous stretch of stones, bounded anywhere between the first and the last of their sequence, yet always a valid segment existing wholly within the line. Once a stretch is chosen, they may invoke the power of the ancient spirits to add a secret integer\u2014positive, negative, or even neutral\u2014to every stone in that chosen stretch. This enchanted number subtly shifts the stones\u2019 values in unison, leaving the rest untouched, as if rearranging fate itself for that segment alone.\n\nThe elders\u2019 guiding question is profound: by invoking this alteration just once, how might they maximize the count of stones glowing with a single coveted number, let this magical number be known among them as the \"chosen value\"? The goal is not merely to adjust but to achieve the most radiant chorus of stones all harmonious at this revered number, more than any previous assembly could claim.\n\nBefore the tribes begin their sacred counting, the ritual clarion calls out the initial scroll of data: first, two grand numbers are proclaimed aloud\u2014the total stones in the sequence and the chosen value they desire to manifest. Following this, the sequence of stones\u2019 original values is chanted in order, one after another, painting the current tapestry of their line. After revealing this ensemble, the tribe must declare a singular integer\u2014how many stones can gleam with the chosen number after their single magical adjustment.\n\nLegends recount two tales: in one, the stones were already perfectly aligned, each bearing the chosen number, and no change was needed; every stone remained glowing as one. In another, a trio of stones showed a mix of values, but with a clever shift on the entire sequence, the tribe transformed them so that two stones finally matched the chosen number, a remarkable transformation from what was before.\n\nThus, the ritual beckons the tribe: with a single, precise enchantment on one continuous portion of their sacred stones, can you awaken the greatest possible number resonating at the chosen number\u2019s frequency? This is the ancient puzzle to solve for ultimate harmony in Numeria\u2019s lost civilization.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given array a of length n. You can choose one segment [l, r] (1 \\le l \\le r \\le n) and integer value k (positive, negative or even zero) and change a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\dots, a_r by k each (i.e. a_i := a_i + k for each l \\le i \\le r).\n\nWhat is the maximum possible number of elements with value c that can be obtained after one such operation?\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and c (1 \\le n \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\le c \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5) \u2014 the length of array and the value c to obtain.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5) \u2014 array a.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint one integer \u2014 the maximum possible number of elements with value c which can be obtained after performing operation described above.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n6 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9\n\nSample Output 1\n\n6\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3 2\n6 2 6\n\nSample Output 2\n\n2\n\nNote\nIn the first example we can choose any segment and k = 0. The array will stay same.\n\nIn the second example we can choose segment [1, 3] and k = -4. The array will become [2, -2, 2].",

Each puppet\u2019s shape is determined by how far it extends along the width and height of the stage: one corner fixed at the stage\u2019s origin, the opposite corner dancing out to a horizontal mark and a vertical peak. Beside each puppet, a small gilded plaque displays a number\u2014its own cost to assemble and maintain. The stage was strict in its law: no puppet could hide fully inside the boundaries of another, for no ciphertext loops of enclosures allowed.\n\nFacing this strange geometry, the Fair Nut must conjure a performance that dazzles and frees him\u2014a show built from a chosen troupe of these puppets. Some puppets can be combined to cover a lively patch of the stage, merging their shapes into a united silhouette without overlaps hidden deep within; the bigger this unified patch, the grander the spectacle. Yet, each chosen puppet demands a toll, its cost inscribed on its plaque, a toll that dims the glory. The goal? To pick puppets whose combined stage presence\u2014meaning the sprawling dance floor they cover together\u2014subtracted by the sum of their upkeep plaques, is as resplendent as possible. The grand sum of spectacle minus toll must climb to the highest possible height, filling the theatre\u2019s heart.\n\nBefore putting on the show, the Fair Nut must understand the structure of the input: first, he hears how many distinct puppets inhabit this plane\u2014this count is a whole number between one and one million, a dizzying number of options to consider. For every puppet thereafter, he receives three numbers whispered in sequence on separate lines: the horizontal stretch, the vertical leap, and the golden number of upkeep cost\u2014where the width and height are themselves towering up to a billion steps, and no golden number ever overreaches the raw area of the puppet it belongs to. The stage orders strictly that no puppet\u2019s bounds nest within another\u2019s, ensuring a unique and fair contest for attention.\n\nThe Fair Nut\u2019s task, as scripted by the invisible playwright, is to reply with a single line\u2014one number capturing the finest attainable difference, where the vastness of the gathered stage presence minus the combined tolls of the chosen puppets reaches its peak greatness. This number reflects the grandest possible dance the Fair Nut and his helpers can stage, ensuring the brightest spectacle for the theatre\u2019s mystical audience.\n\nTo demonstrate, consider a small troupe of three puppets: their stretches and leaps and upkeep show as (4 4 8), (1 5 0), and (5 2 10). The expert puppeteer reveals that selecting the first and second puppets yields a spectacle size minus toll of nine glittering points\u2014the brightest score possible. In a second scenario, with four puppets stretching differently, the optimal assembly again favors the first two puppets, achieving a top score of ten.\n\nThus, the curtains fall, and the Fair Nut, guided by these precise mechanical laws and nestled geometric truths, prepares his grand dance on the planar stage\u2014measuring spectacle not merely in spread but in the brilliance once the costs have cast their shadows. Only then may he find the escape that awaits beyond this intricate puppet theatre of shapes and sums.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nThe Fair Nut got stacked in planar world. He should solve this task to get out.\n\nYou are given n rectangles with vertexes in (0, 0), (x_i, 0), (x_i, y_i), (0, y_i). For each rectangle, you are also given a number a_i. Choose some of them that the area of union minus sum of a_i of the chosen ones is maximum.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there are no nested rectangles.\n\nNut has no idea how to find the answer, so he asked for your help.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 \\leq n \\leq 10^6)\u00a0\u2014 the number of rectangles.\n\nEach of the next n lines contains three integers x_i, y_i and a_i (1 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 10^9, 0 \\leq a_i \\leq x_i \\cdot y_i).\n\nIt is guaranteed that there are no nested rectangles.\n\nOutput Format\nIn a single line print the answer to the problem\u00a0\u2014 the maximum value which you can achieve.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n4 4 8\n1 5 0\n5 2 10\n\nSample Output 1\n\n9\n\nSample Input 2\n\n4\n6 2 4\n1 6 2\n2 4 3\n5 3 8\n\nSample Output 2\n\n10\n\nNote\nIn the first example, the right answer can be achieved by choosing the first and the second rectangles.\n\nIn the second example, the right answer can also be achieved by choosing the first and the second rectangles.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the ancient kingdom of Numeria, the High Census Chronicler was entrusted with a grand task: to catalog the diverse treasures collected across the land, each represented as a unique rune inscribed with a secret number. These runes were arranged in a long scroll, and the Chronicler wished to separate this scroll into distinct sections, which the kingdom called \"segments,\" each containing at least one rune. This separation was to be done under strict royal decree, ensuring that every rune belonged to exactly one segment, leaving no rune unaccounted for or overlapping in any section.\n\nThe kingdom\u2019s law forbade any coalition of these segments from forming a conspiratorial balance \u2014 a forbidden alignment in which the secret codes within several selected segments would, when combined by the arcane operation known only as \"XOR,\" create a perfect null signal, effectively a mysterious zero. Such null signals were believed to awaken ancient curses and were strictly outlawed. Thus, the Chronicler\u2019s challenge was to divide the scroll into as many isolated segments as possible without ever allowing any non-empty gathering of these segments to reveal that cursed zero. If no partitioning like this existed at all, the Chronicler was to declare the task impossible, marked by a solemn \u201c-1\u201d etched in the official ledger.\n\nTo begin the census, the Chronicler first inscribed on the royal parchment a single number, the length of the scroll\u2014that is, the total count of runes contained in the scroll, a figure not exceeding two hundred thousand, to remind the scribe of the scroll's extensive reach. On the very next line, the Chronicler arrayed the secret numbers imprinted on each rune, each a value no greater than a billion, forming the sequence to be carefully segmented.\n\nThe Chronicler\u2019s mission was clear: from this scroll of numbered runes, craft the greatest possible number of these lawful segments, ensuring that no forbidden null signal would arise from any band of chosen segments combined. The output, written with precision in the official ledger, would be the maximum count of such lawful segments that could be conceived, or a bold \u201c-1\u201d to signify the absence of any legitimate partition.\n\nIn one tale of the scroll with four runes carrying the numbers five, five again, seven, and two, the Chronicler found that splitting the runes into two segments was the peak of lawful partitioning. While attempting more divisions invited the forbidden curse \u2014 for certain groups\u2019 combined secrets would cancel out to the dreadful zero \u2014 this two-part division held safe and strong. In a different scroll of three runes with numbers one, two, and three, no prudent division could save the Chronicler from the curse, prompting a solemn \u201c-1\u201d in the ledger. Yet, for another trio of runes marked by three, one, and ten, the Chronicler\u2019s wisdom allowed each rune to stand alone, forming three segments, each immune to the zero curse, hence the triumphant number three was recorded.\n\nThus, the Chronicler, armed with the knowledge of arcane combination and royal law, vied to slice the kingdom\u2019s rune scrolls into the purest partitions possible, crafting the grandest census ledger free from the ancient curse\u2019s shadow.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n of integer numbers.\n\nYour task is to divide the array into the maximum number of segments in such a way that:\n\n- each element is contained in exactly one segment;\n- each segment contains at least one element;\n- there doesn't exist a non-empty subset of segments such that bitwise XOR of the numbers from them is equal to 0.\n\nPrint the maximum number of segments the array can be divided into. Print -1 if no suitable division exists.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5) \u2014 the size of the array.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n (0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the maximum number of segments the array can be divided into while following the given constraints. Print -1 if no suitable division exists.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4\n5 5 7 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3\n1 2 3\n\nSample Output 2\n\n-1\n\nSample Input 3\n\n3\n3 1 10\n\nSample Output 3\n\n3\n\nNote\nIn the first example 2 is the maximum number. If you divide the array into \\{[5], [5, 7, 2]\\}, the XOR value of the subset of only the second segment is 5 \\oplus 7 \\oplus 2 = 0. \\{[5, 5], [7, 2]\\} has the value of the subset of only the first segment being 5 \\oplus 5 = 0. However, \\{[5, 5, 7], [2]\\} will lead to subsets \\{[5, 5, 7]\\} of XOR 7, \\{[2]\\} of XOR 2 and \\{[5, 5, 7], [2]\\} of XOR 5 \\oplus 5 \\oplus 7 \\oplus 2 = 5.\n\nLet's take a look at some division on 3 segments \u2014 \\{[5], [5, 7], [2]\\}. It will produce subsets:\n\n- \\{[5]\\}, XOR 5;\n- \\{[5, 7]\\}, XOR 2;\n- \\{[5], [5, 7]\\}, XOR 7;\n- \\{[2]\\}, XOR 2;\n- \\{[5], [2]\\}, XOR 7;\n- \\{[5, 7], [2]\\}, XOR 0;\n- \\{[5], [5, 7], [2]\\}, XOR 5;\n\nAs you can see, subset \\{[5, 7], [2]\\} has its XOR equal to 0, which is unacceptable. You can check that for other divisions of size 3 or 4, non-empty subset with 0 XOR always exists.\n\nThe second example has no suitable divisions.\n\nThe third example array can be divided into \\{[3], [1], [10]\\}. No subset of these segments has its XOR equal to 0.",

        "question_title": "Isolation",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the bustling realm of Eldoria, nestled deep within twisting ivy and bubbling brooks, stood a legendary inn famed far and wide not just for its hearty ales but for a curious ledger\u2014one that recorded the mysterious ways its patrons\u2019 tales were divided and arranged over the course of a night. This ledger, ancient and cryptic, contained entries describing sequences of enchanted numbers, each whispering the nuances of an inn\u2019s nightly fellowship. The innkeeper was entrusted with the task of partitioning these sequences into various tales, each told without interruption, preserving harmony and adhering to an arcane law dictated by the spirits of Eldoria.\n\nAccording to the spirits\u2019 edict, every tale must be a continuous segment of the sequence; no tale could be empty, and the tales could not overlap or skip any number from the nightly sequence. Moreover, there was a sacred limitation that each tale could harbor at most a certain number of unique guests who had attended exactly once during that segment\u2019s telling. The result of this restriction kept the stories balanced and the listeners enchanted, preventing confusion born from too many fleeting appearances. The innkeeper\u2019s challenge was thus to segment the entire nightly sequence of guest numbers into these tales, obeying the ancient rule: no segment could have more than a number (determined each night) of distinct guests appearing a lone time in it.\n\nThis mystical task had a clear purpose: to discover in how many distinct manners the innkeeper could divide the sequence into such harmonious tales, fully respecting the spirit-imposed cap on solitary guests per segment. The inn\u2019s ledger took a specific format on record nights: first, it would disclose the total count of enchanted numbers that appeared that evening, and the maximal count of single-time guests allowed per tale. On the very next line, it detailed the series of guest numbers themselves\u2014each representing a magical entity or a visitor\u2019s essence bound in that night\u2019s story. The innkeeper\u2019s answer\u2014the number of valid partitions\u2014was always recorded not as a simple tally, but as a remainder after division by a great Eldorian prime stone\u2019s value, ensuring that the count stayed within mystic bounds and could be rightly celebrated.\n\nTo illuminate the challenge, consider a small gathering where three guests visited, and the rule allowed at most a single guest appearing once in any tale. The ledger showed three numbers: 1, 1, and 2. The innkeeper found there were exactly three rightful segmentations of the sequence: one where each guest was a separate tale, one where the first two identical guests shared a tale and the last formed its own, and one where all were weaved into a single grand tale. An attempt to break the sequence so that a segment ended up with two lone visitors was forbidden by the spirits\u2019 law. In a richer night with five guests and a looser restriction, the count of harmonious partitions leapt higher, reflecting the growing complexity and the innkeeper\u2019s skill in balancing the ancient rules.\n\nThus, the problem of the Eldoria Inn\u2019s ledger was more than a mere puzzle: it was a dance of numbers and stories, a test of patience and cunning to organize the night\u2019s tapestry of guests into segmented narratives without breaking the sacred decree on solitary visitor count. The innkeeper\u2019s final report echoed in the realm\u2014a single number, the count of all possible valid segmentations, given the secrets of that night\u2019s enchanted sequence. And so the innkeeper, scribe of fate, recorded the magic, forever balancing the legion of stories twined by the guests within the bounds of the Eldorian legends.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nFind the number of ways to divide an array a of n integers into any number of disjoint non-empty segments so that, in each segment, there exist at most k distinct integers that appear exactly once.\n\nSince the answer can be large, find it modulo 998\\,244\\,353.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 \\leq k \\leq n \\leq 10^5) \u2014 the number of elements in the array a and the restriction from the statement.\n\nThe following line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1 \\leq a_i \\leq n) \u2014 elements of the array a.\n\nOutput Format\nThe first and only line contains the number of ways to divide an array a modulo 998\\,244\\,353.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 1\n1 1 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5 2\n1 1 2 1 3\n\nSample Output 2\n\n14\n\nSample Input 3\n\n5 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nSample Output 3\n\n16\n\nNote\nIn the first sample, the three possible divisions are as follows.\n\n- [[1], [1], [2]]\n- [[1, 1], [2]]\n- [[1, 1, 2]]\n\nDivision [[1], [1, 2]] is not possible because two distinct integers appear exactly once in the second segment [1, 2].",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\n**Urban Legend Investigator Log: The Tale of the Ascending Whispers**\n\nIn the sprawling metropolis where secrets slither beneath the neon glow, an investigator has stumbled upon an intriguing legend whispered among the city's data phantoms. They speak of a mysterious stretch of the city's heartbeat\u2014a sequence of signs, numbers etched invisibly on the walls of alleys\u2014where from any chosen segment, one can trace a path of ever-growing echoes. These echoes are not mere happenstance; they follow a strict ritual: each successive whisper must be the very next to surpass the former in strength and mystery. The city calls such a chain a \"greedy sequence,\" for it always claws forward, never settling for less.\n\nThe rules are tight in this urban labyrinth. Imagine that the entire city\u2019s numeric pulse is chronicled as a long procession of measured beats\u2014thousands upon thousands, no fewer than one and no more than a colossal million, recording the city's breath. From this heartbeat, the investigator focuses on sub-portions of exactly a certain length, the segment size. For each such segment\u2014a window slipping one heartbeat at a time along the city\u2019s pulse\u2014the quest is to reveal the longest chain of ascending whispers. This chain must begin at some pulse and proceed forward strictly by finding the next closest beat that is stronger than its predecessor, never skipping or retreating. The challenge lies in uncovering this chain\u2019s maximum possible length, and the investigator needs the results for every such moving window of the city\u2019s pulse.\n\nTo begin, the city's data keeper provides two numbers on the first line: the total length of the city\u2019s pulse\u2014a vast string of numbers\u2014and the fixed length of the segment that the investigator must probe. On the second line, the heartbeat itself is laid bare: each pulse ranging from the smallest note to as strong as any other beat in the city, again respecting the scale of total pulses. The output expected, like a secret code unlocked, is a series of numbers, each representing the longest greedy chain discerned from every consecutive window of the city\u2019s pulse of specified length. The first number corresponds to the chain from the first segment, the second from the next segment just one beat forward, and so on, marching until all possible windows have been examined.\n\nThe investigator tests this on a smaller echo in the city's heart:\n\n- For a stream of six pulses, with the segment length set at four, the whispers are: first low, then strong, then mid, stronger still, dipping, then rising high.\n- The longest revealing chains found within each segment lead to sequences of lengths two, two, and three respectively\u2014each narrating its ascent in the urban jungle.\n\nIn another shadowed corner, with seven pulses and a larger segment, the chains grow slightly longer. The pulses here mingle in a similar rhythm but reveal longest chains of length three in their analyzed windows\u2014sometimes starting high, sometimes weaving through middling beats, but always climbing.\n\nThus, the investigator\u2019s log records not just the pulses, but the story of their ascending whispers\u2014the greedy subsequences\u2014dispelling the enigma that lies within the city's endless numeric breaths, illuminating every segment with the fullest chain of growth the data conceals. The legend lingers, but the investigator\u2019s tally offers a beacon through the dark.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nFor some array c, let's denote a greedy subsequence as a sequence of indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_l such that 1 \\le p_1 < p_2 < \\dots < p_l \\le |c|, and for each i \\in [1, l - 1], p_{i + 1} is the minimum number such that p_{i + 1} > p_i and c[p_{i + 1}] > c[p_i].\n\nYou are given an array a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n. For each its subsegment of length k, calculate the length of its longest greedy subsequence.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \\le k \\le n \\le 10^6) \u2014 the length of array a and the length of subsegments.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le n) \u2014 array a.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint n - k + 1 integers \u2014 the maximum lengths of greedy subsequences of each subsegment having length k. The first number should correspond to subsegment a[1..k], the second \u2014 to subsegment a[2..k + 1], and so on.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n6 4\n1 5 2 5 3 6\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2 2 3\n\nSample Input 2\n\n7 6\n4 5 2 5 3 6 6\n\nSample Output 2\n\n3 3\n\nNote\nIn the first example:\n\n- [1, 5, 2, 5] \u2014 the longest greedy subsequences are 1, 2 ([c_1, c_2] = [1, 5]) or 3, 4 ([c_3, c_4] = [2, 5]).\n- [5, 2, 5, 3] \u2014 the sequence is 2, 3 ([c_2, c_3] = [2, 5]).\n- [2, 5, 3, 6] \u2014 the sequence is 1, 2, 4 ([c_1, c_2, c_4] = [2, 5, 6]).\n\nIn the second example:\n\n- [4, 5, 2, 5, 3, 6] \u2014 the longest greedy subsequences are 1, 2, 6 ([c_1, c_2, c_6] = [4, 5, 6]) or 3, 4, 6 ([c_3, c_4, c_6] = [2, 5, 6]).\n- [5, 2, 5, 3, 6, 6] \u2014 the subsequence is 2, 3, 5 ([c_2, c_3, c_5] = [2, 5, 6]).",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the hallowed halls of the Arcane Academy, every year the grand Examination of Geometria tests the apprentices' mastery over the mystical nodes scattered across the enchanted plane. This plane holds a sacred collection of glowing points, each uniquely placed by the ancient architects so that no trio ever aligns perfectly straight\u2014an essential law of this realm to preserve magical balance. The Academy gathers no fewer than five and no more than a few hundred such points, each positioned within an immense magical grid spanning from depths of negative a million to heights of positive a million in both directions.\n\nTo pass this trial, the apprentice must seek out *pentagrams*\u2014not the mere shape drawn by common folk, but a special configuration of five points named A, B, C, D, and E. These points must be selected such that when connected in a magical ritual, their lines pair and cross to form the iconic five-pointed star, regardless of how far apart they are. The size of these lines is irrelevant; what truly matters is the exact pattern of crossing connections. This sacred pattern ensures that the intersections appear as destined by the ancient geometrists, and no subset of five points failing to manifest such intersections qualifies for a pentagram.\n\nThe task bestowed upon the examinee is clear: given a collection of N points, where N ranges from five to three hundred, and knowing that none align trio-wise, determine how many unique groups of five points reveal this pentagram enchantment. Each point's location is whispered on the scroll as two integers\u2014their horizontal and vertical magical coordinates\u2014from the farthest reaches of the grid. The apprentice must count the full number of five-point sets that summon forth the pentagram essence and return this magical tally as a single number.\n\nThe Academy\u2019s tomes clarify how this knowledge is recorded. First, the apprentice reads an integer depicting the total number of points on the map. Then, line by line, each point's mystical coordinates are disclosed. Finally, the count of all pentagram-forming quintets must be revealed as a simple integer inscribed on the last page. In one notable trial, five points arranged simply with one apex forming a star yielded a count of one pentagram. In another, a similar five-point cluster failed to align the magical crosses, producing none. In a grander test with ten points scattered over the plane\u2019s vast expanse, a forest of eighty-five pentagrams shimmered into existence.\n\nThus, the apprentice harnesses the power of geometry and combinatorics to unveil the hidden harmony among the cosmos\u2019 points, not merely to find any five points, but to find all that echo the sacred five-pointed star. The triumph is counted not by mere presence but by the fullness of their eternal dance\u2014a testament to the true mastery of the Arcane Academy\u2019s Examination of Geometria.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a set of n points in a 2D plane. No three points are collinear.\n\nA pentagram is a set of 5 points A,B,C,D,E that can be arranged as follows.

It is guaranteed that no three points are collinear.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint a single integer, the number of sets of 5 points that form a pentagram.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n0 0\n0 2\n2 0\n2 2\n1 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5\n0 0\n4 0\n0 4\n4 4\n2 3\n\nSample Output 2\n\n0\n\nSample Input 3\n\n10\n841746 527518\n595261 331297\n-946901 129987\n670374 -140388\n-684770 309555\n-302589 415564\n-387435 613331\n-624940 -95922\n945847 -199224\n24636 -565799\n\nSample Output 3\n\n85\n\nNote\nA picture of the first sample: A picture of the second sample: A picture of the third sample:",

You need to implement the logic for this function.\n4. **Counting:** If the `is_pentagram` function returns `True`, the `count` variable is incremented.\n5. **Output:** Finally, the code prints the total count of pentagrams found.\n\n**Implementing `is_pentagram`:**\n\nThe `is_pentagram` function is where you need to implement the core logic to determine if a set of 5 points forms a pentagram. This involves checking the intersections of the lines formed by the points.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn a realm where the flow of time is carefully monitored and regulated, the Temporal Authority maintains an intricate array of epochs \u2014 a grand sequence of moments from the birth of the universe to its farthest reaches. Each unique moment is labeled distinctly, forming a perfect sequence where no two moments share the same identity, and every identity is represented once and only once. The Authority\u2019s challenge is to scrutinize the timelines within this sequence\u2014segments bracketed by two moments\u2014to uncover special intervals where the endpoints hold a rare harmony with the peak moment inside.\n\nThe temporal regulation law states: a segment of moments between two markers within the timeline is deemed \u201cspecial\u201d if the sum of the identities at these two endpoints matches exactly the identity of the single moment that stands tallest\u2014greatest in its value\u2014among all moments contained in between them. No other moment inside this segment surpasses this tallest identity; the sum at the edges must equal this unique maximum. The Authority is tasked with finding how many such special intervals exist in the entire timeline of moments.\n\nTo explore this, the Temporal Archivist first receives an instruction: a single number denoting how vast the timeline is, the count of moments arranged consecutively \u2014 a number no less than three and potentially as large as two hundred thousand. On the following line, the Archivist obtains the exact sequence of these moments, each distinct and containing every identity from the earliest to the latest in flawless order. The Archivist\u2019s mission is to determine how many segments formed within this sequence qualify as special, honoring the temporal regulation.\n\nFor clarity, consider these ancient records: when the timeline spans five moments, identified as three, four, one, five, and two, the Archivist finds exactly two special intervals. One stretches from the first to the fourth moment, where the sum of these endpoints coincides with the supreme moment within, five. Another smaller segment similarly obeys this uncommon rule. In a shorter timeline of three moments\u2014one, three, two\u2014the Archivist spots a singular special interval where the endpoints\u2019 identities sum perfectly to the peak.\n\nThus, by reading the initial count of moments on the first line followed by the sequence on the next, the Archivist outputs the tally of special intervals found in their quest. This process ensures the flow of time remains orderly and that every hidden harmony in the sequence is recognized and recorded, preserving the cosmic balance as dictated by the Time Travel Regulation Protocols.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a permutation p of n integers 1, 2, ..., n (a permutation is an array where each element from 1 to n occurs exactly once).\n\nLet's call some subsegment p[l, r] of this permutation special if p_l + p_r = \\max \\limits_{i = l}^{r} p_i. Please calculate the number of special subsegments.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains one integer n (3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 \\le p_i \\le n). All these integers are pairwise distinct.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the number of special subsegments of the given permutation.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n3 4 1 5 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3\n1 3 2\n\nSample Output 2\n\n1\n\nNote\nSpecial subsegments in the first example are [1, 5] and [1, 3].\n\nThe only special subsegment in the second example is [1, 3].",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the shadowy world of corporate espionage, a clandestine syndicate known as Toad Pimple runs its operation through a secretive code \u2014 a sequence of encrypted messages stored in a linear vault, each message marked by a unique signature of numerical glyphs. This vault stretches across a sprawling corridor, holding a total of many such cryptic entries, stretching up to three hundred thousand in number. Operatives communicate using these encrypted signatures, forming intricate chains that allow information to flow only under strict conditions dictated by the underlying codes.\n\nWithin this forbidden domain, reachability between two messages depends on a subtle but ruthless system. For a message deeper in the vault to be considered accessible from an earlier one, there must be a path moving forward through the vault such that each step along the way connects two messages sharing a common encrypted trait \u2014 this trait is found only if the overlapping bits of their numeric signatures have a non-zero intersection upon a secret bitwise test, effectively signaling a shared intelligence thread. Such pathways must strictly go forward through the vault, never going backward or revisiting earlier messages, ensuring every link in this chain adheres to these encoded alliances.\n\nYou, an elite operative, are tasked with verifying the possibility of establishing a secure line of communication between pairs of messages within this vast vault. Each query in your dossier presents two indices: an origin point and a destination farther down the corridor. Your mission is to report, with absolute certainty and efficiency, whether there exists any chain of intermediate messages forming an unbroken sequence as prescribed \u2014 each adjacent pair connected by that shared encrypted trait. Time is of the essence, as you must process up to hundreds of thousands of such requests swiftly, reflecting the dangerous tempo of your espionage endeavors.\n\nThe intelligence protocol requires your input precisely: on the first line, the total number of vault entries and the count of queries you must answer are declared, bounded by three hundred thousand each \u2014 the operation\u2019s scale is immense. Next, on a single sprawling line, the entire sequence of encrypted signatures of the vault entries is revealed, each between zero and three hundred thousand. Following this, each subsequent line outlines a pair of positions within the vault \u2014 your origin and your potential destination \u2014 with the destination always found deeper into the vault than the origin, maintaining the forward march of information flow.\n\nYour response must be as terse as it is decisive: for every query, deliver a single line containing either \u201cShi\u201d if the destination is reachable following the established chain of encrypted alliances, or \u201cFou\u201d if no such path exists. This binary verdict is critical; it separates success from failure in a world where every message must move covertly through the shadows.\n\nConsider this scenario: the vault holds five encrypted messages with signatures [1, 3, 0, 2, 1], and you face three queries. The first asks if the third message is reachable from the first; it is not, since the third harbors no common trait with any predecessor, effectively a dead end, marked by zero. The second inquires about the fourth message from the second; here, a hidden thread binds the second and fourth messages, confirming a path. The third query tests if the fourth can be reached from the first, which can be navigated through the second message acting as a link. Your responses are \u201cFou,\u201d \u201cShi,\u201d and \u201cShi,\u201d respectively, exemplifying the delicate webs your craft must untangle.\n\nThis is your world, where every digital whisper could mean power or ruin \u2014 your proficiency in decoding these silent connections will determine the fate of secrets locked deep within Toad Pimple\u2019s shadowed vault.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nToad Pimple has an array of integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n.\n\nWe say that y is reachable from x if x<y and there exists an integer array p such that x = p_1 < p_2 < \\ldots < p_k=y, and a_{p_i}\\, \\&\\, a_{p_{i+1}} > 0 for all integers i such that 1 \\leq i < k.\n\nHere \\& denotes the bitwise AND operation.\n\nYou are given q pairs of indices, check reachability for each of them.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \\leq n \\leq 300\\,000, 1 \\leq q \\leq 300\\,000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of integers in the array and the number of queries you need to answer.\n\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (0 \\leq a_i \\leq 300\\,000)\u00a0\u2014 the given array.\n\nThe next q lines contain two integers each. The i-th of them contains two space-separated integers x_i and y_i (1 \\leq x_i < y_i \\leq n). You need to check if y_i is reachable from x_i.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput q lines. In the i-th of them print \"Shi\" if y_i is reachable from x_i, otherwise, print \"Fou\".\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5 3\n1 3 0 2 1\n1 3\n2 4\n1 4\n\nSample Output 1\n\nFou\nShi\nShi\n\nNote\nIn the first example, a_3 = 0. You can't reach it, because AND with it is always zero. a_2\\, \\&\\, a_4 > 0, so 4 is reachable from 2, and to go from 1 to 4 you can use p = [1, 2, 4].",

        "question_title": "Minimal Segment Cover",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn a sprawling toy factory nestled in a bustling industrial complex, a grand machine line stretches endlessly along a glowing blueprint\u2014a vibrant numeric ribbon that represents every step in the toy assembly process. Along this continuous timeline, there are designated segments where specialized machines can operate, each segment marking a stretch of the production line that can be overseen or automated by one machine. Each machine\u2019s coverage is like a band of influence on the blueprint, starting and ending at certain points along the line, always flowing smoothly forward from one moment to the next without overlap in time but possibly overlapping in space.\n\nThe factory overseers keep a record of these machine coverage bands. Each band is mapped by two markers: the start point where the machine begins its operation, and the endpoint where its influence ends\u2014never backward, always marching forward, and never overlapping beyond the maximum length of the production line. The number of these machine bands is vast, reaching into the tens of thousands, reflecting a highly complex system. Alongside this, requests arrive from the planning team, each specifying a portion of the assembly line they want fully covered by machines\u2014every fraction of that stretch must be guaranteed supervised. These requests often span large segments and need to be met efficiently, by stacking as few machine bands as possible to cover the entire segment continuously without gaps or uncovered points, even those not exactly at an integer step on the blueprint.\n\nThe central challenge for the factory\u2019s operations strategist is to determine, for each request, the smallest number of these machine bands required so that every point in the requested segment\u2014whether whole or a fraction\u2014is under the watchful eyes of at least one machine. If it turns out impossible to line up machines to cover every point from the request\u2019s start to its end, the strategist must report a failure for that task. This challenge demands a careful balance: the segments chosen must overlap or meet seamlessly and cover the requested range entirely, ensuring no moment in the process is left unmonitored, while using as few machines as necessary to optimize efficiency and conserve resources.\n\nThe blueprint record arrives first with two grand numbers written side by side: one revealing how many machine bands the blueprint holds and the other showing how many coverage requests need attending. Then comes a detailed list: each line defines a machine band by marking the start and end points of its influence on the assembly line. Following these are lines of requests, each with its own start and finish coordinates along the continuous timeline. The output expected is a steadfast sequence of numbers, each revealing the minimum count of bands needed for that request to be fully covered, or a solemn minus one if no arrangement suffices to meet the demand.\n\nTo illuminate this, consider a factory where two machine bands are recorded: one overseeing from point one to three, the other from two to four. Three requests follow: the first asks to cover from one to three, which one band aptly accomplishes; the second stretches from one to four, requiring both bands to stitch together coverage across the entire segment; and the last requiring coverage from three to four is beheld by the second band alone. In another scenario, three bands oversee overlapping and separate parts of the line, but some requests cover areas beyond continuous coverage by all the bands combined, offering no way to meet those demands, earning the silent refusal of minus ones. Through this meticulous dance of coverage and requests, the factory ensures every part of its intricate process is watched over tirelessly, and every plan is executed with precision and efficiency.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given n intervals in form [l; r] on a number line.\n\nYou are also given m queries in form [x; y]. What is the minimal number of intervals you have to take so that every point (not necessarily integer) from x to y is covered by at least one of them?\n\nIf you can't choose intervals so that every point from x to y is covered, then print -1 for that query.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5) \u2014 the number of intervals and the number of queries, respectively.\n\nEach of the next n lines contains two integer numbers l_i and r_i (0 \\le l_i < r_i \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5) \u2014 the given intervals.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integer numbers x_i and y_i (0 \\le x_i < y_i \\le 5 \\cdot 10^5) \u2014 the queries.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint m integer numbers. The i-th number should be the answer to the i-th query: either the minimal number of intervals you have to take so that every point (not necessarily integer) from x_i to y_i is covered by at least one of them or -1 if you can't choose intervals so that every point from x_i to y_i is covered.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n2 3\n1 3\n2 4\n1 3\n1 4\n3 4\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\n2\n1\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3 4\n1 3\n1 3\n4 5\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n1 5\n\nSample Output 2\n\n1\n1\n-1\n-1\n\nNote\nIn the first example there are three queries:\n\n1. query [1; 3] can be covered by interval [1; 3];\n2. query [1; 4] can be covered by intervals [1; 3] and [2; 4]. There is no way to cover [1; 4] by a single interval;\n3. query [3; 4] can be covered by interval [2; 4]. It doesn't matter that the other points are covered besides the given query.\n\nIn the second example there are four queries:\n\n1. query [1; 2] can be covered by interval [1; 3]. Note that you can choose any of the two given intervals [1; 3];\n2. query [1; 3] can be covered by interval [1; 3];\n3. query [1; 4] can't be covered by any set of intervals;\n4. query [1; 5] can't be covered by any set of intervals.

        "question_title": "Yet Another Partiton Problem",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the shadowed halls of the Haunted Library, a peculiar ritual governs how mystic scrolls are arranged. The library\u2019s grand custodian, the spectral archivist, guards a collection of enchanted parchments, each bearing an ancient rune of power. These parchments must be grouped into clusters, each cluster a contiguous scroll sequence guarded by a single phantasmal seal. The library dictates that every scroll belongs to exactly one cluster, no scroll left wandering untethered.\n\nThe strength\u2014or \u201cweight\u201d\u2014of each cluster is dictated by an eerie formula whispered among ghostly scholars: multiply the count of scrolls embraced by the cluster by the mightiest rune within it. The greater the rune\u2019s power in the cluster, and the more scrolls it guards, the heavier the burden of that cluster becomes. The archivist\u2019s challenge is to partition the entire collection into exactly a chosen number of these clusters, forming a spectral barrier of minimal overall might, so the entire display remains balanced and stable against spectral storms.\n\nThe task for the young apprentice spirit is clear: given the total number of scrolls, and the desired count of spectral clusters, along with the hidden power inscribed on each scroll, determine the arrangement that yields the least combined weight. To observe the problem, the apprentice must first receive the scroll count and the number of clusters on the opening line\u2014these are modest in number, never surpassing twenty thousand scrolls, and the cluster count remains humble, no more than one hundred or the number of scrolls themselves, whichever is smaller. On the next line, the apprentice senses the individual rune powers of each scroll, each power being a tangible force no weaker than one and no stronger than twenty thousand.\n\nThe apprentice returns a single value: the smallest possible sum of all cluster weights found by any stately division of the scrolls. This value guides the spectral archivist\u2019s hands as they rearrange the glowing parchments across the haunted shelves.\n\nConsider a few revelations found by earlier apprentices: when facing four scrolls enchanted with the values six, one, seven, and four, and asked to divide into two clusters, the minimal weight towers at twenty-five, best achieved by keeping the first three scrolls bonded and the last alone. If the goal shifts to three clusters with the same four scrolls, a lighter balance of twenty-one is unveiled by a stricter separation\u2014each scroll standing alone except the last pair, which guards the dual scroll cluster. For five scrolls with an alternating power pattern of five, one, five, one, and five, divided into four clusters, the optimal harmony sums to twenty-one by weaving together clusters that favor solo runes and pairs to minimize overall weight.\n\nThus, to appease the haunted shelves, the apprentice\u2019s incantations must conjure the partition granting the least spectral burden, forging order from the arcane chaos of the enchanted runes.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given array a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n. You need to split it into k subsegments (so every element is included in exactly one subsegment).\n\nThe weight of a subsegment a_l, a_{l+1}, \\dots, a_r is equal to (r - l + 1) \\cdot \\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}(a_i). The weight of a partition is a total weight of all its segments.\n\nFind the partition of minimal weight.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4, 1 \\le k \\le \\min(100, n)) \u2014 the length of the array a and the number of subsegments in the partition.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4) \u2014 the array a.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint single integer \u2014 the minimal weight among all possible partitions.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4 2\n6 1 7 4\n\nSample Output 1\n\n25\n\nSample Input 2\n\n4 3\n6 1 7 4\n\nSample Output 2\n\n21\n\nSample Input 3\n\n5 4\n5 1 5 1 5\n\nSample Output 3\n\n21\n\nNote\nThe optimal partition in the first example is next: 6 1 7 \\bigg| 4.\n\nThe optimal partition in the second example is next: 6 \\bigg| 1 \\bigg| 7 4.\n\nOne of the optimal partitions in the third example is next: 5 \\bigg| 1 5 \\bigg| 1 \\bigg| 5.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn an ancient kingdom overshadowed by celestial forces, the hero was summoned to the Oracle\u2019s Trial\u2014a mystical challenge guarded by the prime gods, known to hold the essence of balance and purity. Before the hero stood a great circle of enchanted stones, each etched with a unique rune glowing with a number, all distinct and ranging from the darkness of zero to the light before the gods\u2019 chosen prime. The Oracle declared that no more than three hundred thousand stones could stand, and the prime that ruled this domain was a mighty sentinel numbering no less than two, but never greater than a billion\u2019s reach.\n\nThe trial\u2019s rules were woven by the gods\u2019 secret logic: the hero must seek pairs of stones, each pair chosen with respect to their order in the circle, such that when the sum of the chosen runes is combined with the sum of their squares, the product of these two quantities, measured through the gods\u2019 mystical modulo, unveiled a hidden number bestowed by the Oracle. This sacred number, less than the prime guardian of the domain, held the key: the hero must count how many distinct pairs (where the smaller stone\u2019s position is first) satisfy this divine condition.\n\nThe task was clear\u2014on the first scroll, the hero received the circle\u2019s size, the prime sentry number, and the Oracle\u2019s chosen key all at once, scribbled plainly as three numbers fitting the ancient bounds. Upon the second scroll lay the runes of each stone in their precise order, distinct and solemn. The hero was then to whisper only one truth back to the Oracle: the total count of pairs whose combined runes entwined through the divine formula, like a harmonious dance, equaled the key when seen through the gods\u2019 prime eyes.\n\nAmong the tales told by previous challengers, one spoke of a circle with three stones and a prime guardian of three, where the key was the void of zero. The three stones bore the runes zero, one, and two. When the hero paired these runes two by two, only a single pair\u2014between the first and third stones\u2014unlocked the divine secret. Another tale told of six stones under a prime guardian of seven with a key of two. Here, three pairs\u2014stones one and five, stones two and three, stones four and six\u2014each sang the Oracle\u2019s song perfectly, their rune sums and squares folding into the sacred pattern.\n\nThe hero now stands at the brink of the Oracle\u2019s challenge, ready to count the pairs that honor the gods\u2019 prime law, crafting a path not just of answers but of elegance and completeness. For only by embracing the full power of these divine rules can the hero emerge victorious from the Trial\u2019s mystic embrace.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a prime number p, n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n, and an integer k.\n\nFind the number of pairs of indexes (i, j) (1 \\le i < j \\le n) for which (a_i + a_j)(a_i^2 + a_j^2) \\equiv k \\bmod p.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains integers n, p, k (2 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5, 2 \\le p \\le 10^9, 0 \\le k \\le p-1). p is guaranteed to be prime.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (0 \\le a_i \\le p-1). It is guaranteed that all elements are different.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput a single integer\u00a0\u2014 answer to the problem.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 3 0\n0 1 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\n\nSample Input 2\n\n6 7 2\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nSample Output 2\n\n3\n\nNote\nIn the first example:\n\n(0+1)(0^2 + 1^2) = 1 \\equiv 1 \\bmod 3.\n\n(0+2)(0^2 + 2^2) = 8 \\equiv 2 \\bmod 3.\n\n(1+2)(1^2 + 2^2) = 15 \\equiv 0 \\bmod 3.\n\nSo only 1 pair satisfies the condition.\n\nIn the second example, there are 3 such pairs: (1, 5), (2, 3), (4, 6).",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the grand city of Lumina, every year the Lantern Festival brings the entire population together in a symphony of light and color. The city is lined with exactly half a million lantern posts, each standing tall and waiting to be adorned. At the festival\u2019s outset, every post is blank, devoid of any luminescence\u2014silent and dark, ready to be transformed by the hands of the citizens. As the festival progresses, the people come with lanterns, adding or sometimes removing lights to these posts, creating a living array of shimmering brilliance.\n\nEach day, the city elders send out instructions governing how the citizens may interact with the lanterns. There are two kinds of edicts they receive. The first edict instructs a citizen to add a certain number of lanterns to a particular post, brightening it accordingly, or sometimes to dim it by removing some lanterns\u2014anywhere between adding and subtracting up to a thousand lanterns at a time. The second edict is a call for knowledge: it asks the scholars to gather the total glow from all posts whose numbers share a precise rhythmic pattern in their numbering\u2014only those whose post numbers fall into a pattern determined by their place when divided by another chosen number, leaving a specific remainder. This means the scholars must find the sum of lantern glimmers across all posts that, when counted in a certain way, fit exactly that beat or remainder from the division rhythm.\n\nNow, these requests arrive in a flood\u2014no fewer than one, but no more than half a million decrees are given during the festival\u2019s span. Each edict is carefully noted: first, the type of instruction, then which post or rhythmic number it refers to, and finally the count of lanterns to add or the remainder sought. The citizens diligently perform the adjustments when told, and the scholars work exhaustively and efficiently to report back, summing all matching posts\u2019 lantern counts to satisfy the curiosity of the festival masters. The challenge unfolds in managing this flow, ensuring each addition or subtraction reaches the correct post, and each query about the rhythmic sum is answered swiftly and precisely.\n\nTo document this grand affair, a scroll must be kept. On the first line of the scroll, the scribes record the total number of commands dispatched by the elders. Then, line by line, the nature of each command is written: first the type\u2014whether an adjustment to a post\u2019s brightness or a summation request\u2014then the distinguishing numbers that guide the action. For each summation inquiry, the scribes must inscribe the resulting glow total on a new line, a beacon of clarity amid the numeric labyrinth of the city\u2019s illumination.\n\nTo illustrate: suppose five commands flow through the day. The first is an instruction to brighten the third lantern post by four lights. The second command summons a tally of all lantern posts whose numbers, when paused to consider three's rhythm in counting, leave no remainder\u2014these glow to a sum of four. The next demands the sum from posts that align to the rhythm of four, offset by three posts\u2014also yielding a total glow of four. Then, a gloom descends briefly as four lanterns are removed from the fourth post, dimming it by that amount. Finally, a grand summation across all posts aligned to the simplest rhythm is requested, revealing a total gentle glow of zero.\n\nThus, the city\u2019s lantern tally evolves gracefully through commands and queries, forever balancing light and shadow, measure and mystery, in the radiant poem of Lumina\u2019s Lantern Festival.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array a consisting of 500000 integers (numbered from 1 to 500000). Initially all elements of a are zero.\n\nYou have to process two types of queries to this array:\n\n- 1 x y\u00a0\u2014 increase a_x by y;\n- 2 x y\u00a0\u2014 compute \\sum\\limits_{i \\in R(x, y)} a_i, where R(x, y) is the set of all integers from 1 to 500000 which have remainder y modulo x.\n\nCan you process all the queries?\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains one integer q (1 \\le q \\le 500000) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nThen q lines follow, each describing a query. The i-th line contains three integers t_i, x_i and y_i (1 \\le t_i \\le 2). If t_i = 1, then it is a query of the first type, 1 \\le x_i \\le 500000, and -1000 \\le y_i \\le 1000. If t_i = 2, then it it a query of the second type, 1 \\le x_i \\le 500000, and 0 \\le y_i < x_i.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there will be at least one query of type 2.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each query of type 2 print one integer \u2014 the answer to it.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n1 3 4\n2 3 0\n2 4 3\n1 4 -4\n2 1 0\n\nSample Output 1\n\n4\n4\n0",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the sprawling realm of the Dream Architects, a mystical domain where ethereal temples and pathways are woven from the very fabric of thought, there lies a unique challenge. Within this domain exists a grand **Tree of Illusions**, a living network of clearings connected by shimmering bridges. Each clearing holds one Dreamer, and the bridges are the paths they may walk between. The Tree's network is so vast it can host hundreds of thousands of Dreamers, yet is always woven without a single cycle, creating a structure both complex and pure.\n\nThe Dreamers have a curious tradition tied to their intricate paths. For any chosen number *i* \u2014 representing a special \u201cdistance\u201d in Dreamland steps \u2014 a **Harmonious Dream Circle** is formed by selecting a group of Dreamers with a peculiar relationship: for every pair of Dreamers in this circle, the number of bridges needed to traverse from one to the other is either exactly *i* or one more than *i*. No other distances may exist between members if they are to be truly harmonious. This means each Dream Circle embodies a delicate balance where all members are almost in perfect step apart \u2014 either precisely in sync or just a little beyond.\n\nThe Dream Architects, eager to explore the deepest symmetries of the Tree, are tasked with a grand quest: for each special number *i* ranging from the smallest possible step up to the number that equals the total Dreamers, identify the largest possible Harmonious Dream Circle. In other words, for each step-count *i*, find the greatest number of Dreamers who can gather while respecting the rule that any two among them are separated by exactly *i* or *i+1* bridges along the Tree. It is not enough to simply find one such circle; the goal is to discover the largest possible circle for every step size, pushing the limits of harmony within the Tree's branches.\n\nThe input for this quest is a sacred text listing the number of Dreamers in the Tree. Initially, the first chapter declares the total count of Dreamers, a vast number reaching into the hundreds of thousands yet never less than two. Following, the scroll unfolds across many lines; each line records a pair of Dreamers linked directly by a bridge, specifying which two clearings share a shimmering pathway. These connections form the skeleton of the Tree, ensuring no loops or tangled knots mar its pure form.\n\nUpon completing the inscriptions, the output is a single revelation: a sequence of numbers, each corresponding to one of the special step sizes from first to last. Each number reveals the size of the grandest Harmonious Dream Circle achievable at that step. Dream Architects celebrate this sequence \u2014 a map illuminating the harmonious groupings hidden within the Tree's ethereal reach.\n\nFor example, in a Tree of five Dreamers where one central Dreamer links to three others, and one of those in turn connects to the fifth, the grand Harmonious Dreams for step sizes one through five are four, three, two, one, and one respectively. This means at the closest step-distance, four Dreamers can gather in near-perfect harmony; at step two, three can unite; and as steps grow longer, the largest possible circles naturally shrink until alone is the only option. In a slightly larger Tree with six Dreamers, another secret emerges: at step two, an even larger quartet finds harmony than before, showing the subtle variations the Tree\u2019s shape can weave.\n\nThus, through this endless quest, the Dream Architects seek the perfect gatherings \u2014 where steps between Dreamers echo with near-regular rhythm in the labyrinthine Tree of Illusions, each step size revealing a new scale of collective harmony amidst the infinite dance of dreams.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nLet G be a simple graph.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the quiet world of a school\u2019s math club, a diligent student keeps a daily diary chronicling their puzzling adventures in problem-solving. Today\u2019s entry introduces a curious classroom challenge: a peculiar arrangement of blocks, resembling stacks piled neatly from tallest to shortest, descending but never increasing as you move from left to right. Imagine these stacks as columns of books lined up along a windowsill, each tower no shorter than the one following it, and none shorter than a single book\u2019s height.\n\nThe teacher calls this arrangement a \u201cYoung diagram,\u201d a special kind of histogram where the number of stacks is a certain count \u2013 it might be up to several hundred thousand \u2013 and the height of each stack can be as tall as that many books as well. Due to the orderly nature of these stacks, each column\u2019s height gently steps down or holds steady to the next, never jumping back up. This means from the tallest stack on the left to the smallest on the right, the heights flow smoothly downward or remain even, but never the other way around.\n\nThe challenge, as described in the diary, is to fill up this arrangement as much as possible with \u201cdominos.\u201d These dominos are small rectangles that cover exactly two spaces\u2014either two books stacked one on top of the other, or two books standing side by side on the windowsill. The student\u2019s goal is to place the greatest number of these dominos within the entire block structure, ensuring they never overlap, and each domino fits neatly inside the existing columns without extending outside.\n\nTo participate, the student receives two types of notes: The first line states the precise number of stacks, and on the second line, the exact height of each stack in order from left to right. Using this knowledge, the student must figure out and write down a single number\u2014the largest count of dominos that can neatly fit without overlapping inside the block structure on the windowsill.\n\nFor example, with five stacks whose heights are three, two, two, two, and one respectively, the student finds that four dominos can be arranged inside this setup without conflict. This solution shows that careful placement, counting the possible pairs of adjacent spaces vertically or horizontally, reveals the maximum domino count possible without overstepping the bounds of the orderly stacks.\n\nThus, the diary closes the day\u2019s entry with a clear record: given any number of columns arranged from tallest to shortest, and the heights of each pile, the student must calculate the largest number of domino-shaped pairs that fit snugly inside\u2014like perfectly stacking dominoes on a descending windowsill, respecting both the orderly heights and the non-overlapping rule.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a Young diagram.\n\nGiven diagram is a histogram with n columns of lengths a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (a_1 \\geq a_2 \\geq \\ldots \\geq a_n \\geq 1).\n\nYoung diagram for a=[3,2,2,2,1].\n\nYour goal is to find the largest number of non-overlapping dominos that you can draw inside of this histogram, a domino is a 1 \\times 2 or 2 \\times 1 rectangle.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of input contain one integer n (1 \\leq n \\leq 300\\,000): the number of columns in the given histogram.\n\nThe next line of input contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1 \\leq a_i \\leq 300\\,000, a_i \\geq a_{i+1}): the lengths of columns.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput one integer: the largest number of non-overlapping dominos that you can draw inside of the given Young diagram.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n3 2 2 2 1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n4\n\nNote\nSome of the possible solutions for the example:",

The game was known as the Ascending Sequence Challenge, where a player was presented with a row of enchanted number tokens laid out in a sequence. The tokens bore whole numbers, some as modest as a single digit, others reaching into the thousands or even beyond. The length of this sequence, the very row of tokens, could stretch from a solitary jewel to as many as five thousand glimmering digits, each waiting to be tuned.\n\nThe enchantment\u2019s law was simple yet strict: the tokens ought to be arranged so that no token held a value less than the one preceding it. This meant the sequence should always flow equal or upwards, never dropping to a smaller number as you moved along the row. The magic of the carnival allowed a curious ability \u2014 at each turn, the player could gently raise or lower the value of any one token by just one point. However, the challenge was to perform this enchanting adjustment with utmost finesse, altering as few tokens as possible and with as little effort as possible. The true test was to transform the initial jumble into a perfectly non-decreasing sequence using the smallest total number of nudges\u2014each nudge being one increment or decrement on a token\u2019s value.\n\nA daring engineer named Little Petya, fascinated by this challenge, often found himself perplexed by the mathematics behind the optimal solution. To assist him, the carnival\u2019s record keeper set forth a challenge to all game engineers: given the starting sequence of tokens \u2014 each specified on its own line after the count of tokens had been announced \u2014 compute and reveal the minimum number of magical nudges required to arrange the tokens in perfectly ascending order, or at least into a sequence that never dips beneath its predecessor. The exact input to be presented begins with the count of tokens on the first record line, followed by the initial values for each token on succeeding lines. For example, a sequence of length five would list five values, one per line, right after stating the number five on the first line.\n\nIn this magical world, the output must be equally clear: a single number etched on a line, representing the smallest total of position-by-position nudges to achieve the goal \u2014 the minimal sum of steps needed to realign the numbers so they march steadily upward or hold steady, never stepping backward.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a starting sequence of five tokens: their values, in order, are three, two, negative one, two, and eleven. Though the journey from this sequence to a non-decreasing arrangement might seem daunting, the minimum total count of single-point changes needed is but four. In another spectacle, if five tokens begin as two, one, one, one, and one, then to gently coax them into a non-decreasing form requires only a solitary nudge. Thus, the carnival\u2019s riddle is not just to follow the rules, but to weave the spell of change so elegantly that the tokens fall into perfect order with the least exertion possible.\n\nThrough this ancient log, the carnival hopes the engineers of the realm decode the art of minimal transformation, turning chaotic sequences into harmoniously ascending patterns, delighting both Little Petya and all who seek mastery over the magical numbers.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nLittle Petya likes to play very much. And most of all he likes to play the following game:\n\nHe is given a sequence of N integer numbers. At each step it is allowed to increase the value of any number by 1 or to decrease it by 1. The goal of the game is to make the sequence non-decreasing with the smallest number of steps. Petya is not good at math, so he asks for your help.\n\nThe sequence a is called non-decreasing if a1 \u2264 a2 \u2264 ... \u2264 aN holds, where N is the length of the sequence.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains single integer N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 5000) \u2014 the length of the initial sequence. The following N lines contain one integer each \u2014 elements of the sequence. These numbers do not exceed 109 by absolute value.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput one integer \u2014 minimum number of steps required to achieve the goal.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n3 2 -1 2 11\n\nSample Output 1\n\n4\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5\n2 1 1 1 1\n\nSample Output 2\n\n1",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nAttention all travelers at the Grand Central Station of Geometry! Today, allow me to paint you a picture of a fascinating challenge faced by a young traveler named Petya. Petya is a passionate artist who loves sketching vivid points on a vast, endless canvas\u2014a plane where magic unfolds. On this canvas, Petya has placed two sets of points: vibrant red ones representing the bustling hubs of the city and serene blue ones symbolizing tranquil lakes. Importantly, the world\u2019s laws forbid any three hubs or lakes to align perfectly straight, ensuring that every formation is unique and poised for discovery.\n\nNow, the city council of this realm has brought forth a unique rule inspired by the natural harmony of the land. They decree that no triangle formed by connecting three distinct red hubs should ever have a peaceful blue lake resting somewhere inside its boundaries. That is, if you imagine drawing lines between any three red hubs, the blue lakes must all lie outside, scattered beyond the edges with none nested within. This rule keeps the lakes safe and unobstructed by the bustling triangles of hubs, preserving the serenity of the waters.\n\nPetya\u2019s quest, therefore, is to count how many such triangle formations can be drawn in the city without upsetting the sanctity of the blue lakes. Imagine the first line of the station announcement reads the numbers of red hubs and blue lakes in the city\u2014non-negative integers that do not surpass five hundred each. Following that, each red hub reveals its unique coordinates on the platform\u2014two integers describing its exact position on the city map. In the lines that come after, each serene lake announces its coordinates similarly, carving out spaces of peace on the map. All coordinates are within a grand range, stretching from immense negative vastness to equally immense positive expanses, though never beyond a billion in either direction.\n\nAs the citizens eagerly wait, the announcement system calls out the final determination with a single integer: the count of all possible distinct triangles formed by red hubs whose interiors are entirely free from any blue lake. This number, as large or small as it might be, reflects the number of safe, harmonious triangles in Petya\u2019s artistic city.\n\nLet me illustrate with examples to guide your imagination: In one cityscape, where four red hubs form the network and only a single blue lake graces the map, it was found that two such peaceful triangles exist\u2014triangles that protect the blue lake\u2019s calm by keeping it outside their reach. In another city with five red hubs and five blue lakes scattered across the terrain, the count rose to seven, signaling a richer tapestry of triangular neighborhoods respecting the lakes\u2019 tranquil boundaries.\n\nThus, dear travelers and thinkers, Petya\u2019s artistry and the city\u2019s laws weave together to find the total number of harmonious triangles, guarding the blue lakes and celebrating the red hubs\u2014a challenge announced clearly on the station for all to ponder and admire.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nLittle Petya likes to draw. He drew N red and M blue points on the plane in such a way that no three points lie on the same line. Now he wonders what is the number of distinct triangles with vertices in red points which do not contain any blue point inside.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two non-negative integer numbers N and M (0 \u2264 N \u2264 500, 0 \u2264 M \u2264 500) \u2014 the number of red and blue points respectively. The following N lines contain two integer numbers each \u2014 coordinates of red points. The following M lines contain two integer numbers each \u2014 coordinates of blue points. All coordinates do not exceed 109 by absolute value.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput one integer \u2014 the number of distinct triangles with vertices in red points which do not contain any blue point inside.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4 1\n0 0\n10 0\n10 10\n5 4\n2 1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5 5\n5 10\n6 1\n8 6\n-6 -7\n7 -1\n5 -1\n10 -4\n-10 -8\n-10 5\n-2 -8\n\nSample Output 2\n\n7",

Among these stones, a wondrous property was preserved: each stone's rune was inscribed such that the number of its prime factors\u2014like hidden temples beneath the surface\u2014was always no more than seven. This rare constraint ensured the stones were bearers of simple, though potent, magic.\n\nThe Elders of Numeria challenged heroes to find a path through these stones, seeking a sub-collection whose combined magic fused into a perfect square\u2014a number whose sacred factors paired flawlessly without remainder. This task was no mere gathering; it demanded the shortest path of stones, a subsequence carved from the original order, possibly by skipping some stones but never rearranging the sequence. The law of subsequences proclaimed that stones could be taken in order, but some could be left behind, as long as their original sequence remained unbroken. The heroes' goal was to discover the smallest band of stones whose multiplied powers combined into a flawless square, or admit defeat if such a blend was impossible.\n\nTo embark on this quest, the heroes first learned the rules woven into their journey: On day one, the number of stones would be revealed\u2014a single integer marking how many stones lay before them, always at least one and at most a hundred thousand. On the next day, the runic numbers of each stone would be displayed in sequence, the magical numbers all bound by ancient laws never surpassing one million. Their trials must uncover the shortest non-empty cluster from these stones so that when these stones\u2019 powers were multiplied and the runic forces combined, the product shimmered as a perfect square\u2014its mystical essence perfectly doubled in every prime factor. Should any such cluster exist, the shortest length of stones chosen was to be revealed; if none could be found, the tragic numeral -1 had to be uttered aloud.\n\nThe heroes recounted previous legends to guide their steps. In one tale, a simple cluster of three stones bore the runes one, four, and six. The hero found that the stone marked by one alone sufficed, as its mystical power manifested a perfect square\u2014shortest pathway just one stone. Another story spoke of four stones with runes two, three, six, and six. There, the answer lay in pairing two identical sixes, whose combined power formed the perfect square, invoking a shortest cluster length of two stones. A more arduous tale told of three stones bearing six, fifteen, and ten; heroes discovered that only by blending all three in unison did the product rise to the perfect square throne, thus the shortest length became three. Yet there was a forbidden legend: four stones marked two, three, five, and seven defied even the strongest wizards, and no subsequence could bear the perfect square\u2019s blessing\u2014hence, the utterance of -1.\n\nThus, the Trial of the Mystic Stones demanded from each hero not merely to find any blend but to unearth the shortest chain whose fusion birthed a perfect square. The input of the trial took shape like ancient scrolls: first, a solemn number revealing the count of stones; second, a line spelled out the runes on each stone in order. When victory was seized, the hero proclaimed the number of stones selected in that shortest perfect square chain; if no hope remained, the lamentation of -1 resounded through the halls.\n\nSo the heroes set forth, mindful that the stones they chose must dance together in perfect harmony, each prime power appearing with twin-souls to unlock the sacred square\u2019s power, seeking the minimal path through this mystical sequence, to triumph in the great Trial of the Square.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array a of length n that has a special condition: every element in this array has at most 7 divisors.

Each wagon bore a number painted boldly on its side, a secret code indicating the weight within, where the weight corresponded to the sum of the digits of that number. The chief's task was not only to assign numbers but to find the very first wagon number from which a chain of consecutive wagons\u2014stretching as wide as a certain count defined by the war leaders\u2014would collectively carry a load precisely matching the required total.\n\nThe commanders set clear laws governing these sequences. The number of demands they would assess in their reports\u2014call this the number of campaigns\u2014would never outnumber one hundred and fifty, for the supply chain had its limits. For each campaign, they would decree two numbers: the total desired combined weight, never surpassing one hundred and fifty units, and the length of the convoy chain, starting from zero up to nine wagons long. The quartermaster\u2019s challenge was to identify the smallest first wagon number so that when you trace the sum of the painted-digit weights on that wagon through the chain\u2014each wagon\u2019s weight determined by adding its individual digits\u2014the sum of all these wagons precisely matched the commander\u2019s requested total weight. And if no such chain existed, the quartermaster was to acknowledge the impossibility openly.\n\nNow, the quartermaster\u2019s ledger required entries recorded meticulously: first, the number of campaigns to be planned, written plainly on the first page. Then, for each campaign, on its own line, would be the requested total weight followed by the convoy length. With each line inscribed, the quartermaster would consult the maps and calculate the minimal starting wagon number whose successive label digits' weights, summed across the convoy length, met the strict demand\u2014if such a number was found. If not, the ledger would state with clarity the absence of such a chain, marking -1 in the place of the wagon number. The entire supply formation's efficiency hinged on choosing the earliest number possible, ensuring the simplest and fastest chain could roll out across the war plains.\n\nConsider the chief\u2019s past campaigns as parables of his art: in one, a solitary wagon was required to hold exactly one unit, and he discerned that numbering wagon \u20181\u2019 met the demand best. On another, needing two wagons\u2019 worth summing to one unit, he found the chain starting from wagon \u20180\u2019 sufficed. When commanding forty-two units over eight wagons, the optimal starting wagon bore the number \u20184\u2019, balancing their combined digit weights perfectly. Yet, in a time desiring thirteen units from the same length, the quartermaster found no viable chain and so solemnly recorded -1. In the grandest logistics challenge where ninety-nine units were expected over two wagons, the enormous number \u2018599998\u2019 was the key, while other more complex configurations required intricate, lengthy numbers like \u201899999999999\u2019 or \u20187997\u2019 to fulfill the demands.\n\nThus, the discipline of war logistics was not solely about might but also about mastering the secrets hidden in numbers, digit sums, and sequences. The quartermaster\u2019s striving for the minimal starting number was both a science and art\u2014ensuring the army marched with supplies neither deficient nor excessive, but precisely forged to the rhythm of digits and demands, a testament to the rigor and elegance of battlefield planning across time.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nLet f(x) be the sum of digits of a decimal number x.\n\nFind the smallest non-negative integer x such that f(x) + f(x + 1) + \\dots + f(x + k) = n.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \\le t \\le 150) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (1 \\le n \\le 150, 0 \\le k \\le 9).\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print one integer without leading zeroes.

Yet, the finale of the year might be a bit of a cliffhanger, with the last week sometimes cutting short, adding a dash of suspense to the closing act.\n\nWithin this grand spectacle, a curious rule governs the harmony between days and weeks: given that months are arranged in their solemn order from the first to the last, some pairs of day-month combinations shimmer with an intriguing coincidence. Imagine two chapters of the year, call them the earlier and the later: a pair of these chapters is called ambiguous if selecting the day number equal to the earlier chapter's position in the later chapter matches the day-of-the-week with that of selecting the day number equal to the later chapter\u2019s position in the earlier chapter. In simpler terms, if you pick a day in one month that corresponds by number to another month's position, and the reverse holds with matching days, they share the same weekday magic and form an intriguing ambiguous duo.\n\nYour grand task as the master of this entertainment flow is to reveal how many such magical ambiguous pairs exist for many different incarnations of the calendar. Each incarnation offers its own world\u2014some with few months and a quick week, others vast and complex beyond imagination. For every world, you are presented three key secrets: the total number of chapters in the year, the fixed number of days in every chapter, and the length of the week that cycles through these days. Your mission, for each world, is to count all the possible ambiguous pairs where the chapter number of the first is smaller than the second, revealing the intricate dance of days and weeks.\n\nThe chronicles you receive come in a precise form: first, you are told how many worlds there are to analyze, a number not so vast as one thousand but big enough to keep your clever mind engaged. For each world, you are handed three mighty numbers on their own line: the count of months shaping the year, the length of those months in days, and the weekly cycle's length in days. Armed with this knowledge, you must conjure the output\u2014line by line\u2014each line revealing the total count of ambiguous pairs that the world holds in its temporal folds.\n\nLet me share a few glimpses into these worlds and their mysterious pairs. Consider a realm with six chapters, where each chapter holds seven days, and a week cycles every four days: here, six ambiguous pairs reveal themselves, whispering secrets across the calendar. In a larger chronicle with ten chapters, weeks lasting twelve days, and chapters with seven days each, nine such pairs appear, balancing day and chapter in a complex harmony. Another world of twelve chapters and thirty days per chapter under the constant seven-day week rule conceals five unique pairs. A world as simple as one chapter with one day and a one-day week, however, tells of no ambiguous pairs at all. And in a vast realm with millions of months and days, and an awe-inspiring week lasting hundreds of thousands of days, over a hundred million pairs waltz invisibly within the shifting shadows of time.\n\nThus, with your keen eye and logical art, you shall unravel the secrets of Berland\u2019s time\u2014that curious interplay where day and month meet in perfect step, crafting the ambiguous pairs that tell the real story behind the seemingly endless passage of days.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nBerland year consists of m months with d days each. Months are numbered from 1 to m. Berland week consists of w days. The first day of the year is also the first day of the week. Note that the last week of the year might be shorter than w days.\n\nA pair (x, y) such that x < y is ambiguous if day x of month y is the same day of the week as day y of month x.\n\nCount the number of ambiguous pairs.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 1000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of testcases.\n\nEach of the next t lines contains three integers m, d and w (1 \\le m, d, w \\le 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the number of months in a year, the number of days in a month and the number of days in a week.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint t integers\u00a0\u2014 for each testcase output the number of pairs (x, y) such that x < y and day x of month y is the same day of the week as day y of month x.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n6 7 4\n10 7 12\n12 30 7\n1 1 1\n3247834 10298779 625324\n\nSample Output 1\n\n6\n9\n5\n0\n116461800\n\nNote\nHere are the pairs for the first test case:",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the fractured world after the collapse, survivors cluster into scattered outposts, each patch of land fragmented into grids where every square inch must be destined or damned. One such community lives within a vast camp, a sprawling territory laid out in rows and columns of markers\u2014either lit or unlit\u2014that together form a patchwork ground known simply as the Grid. This Grid, measured by the count of rows and the count of columns, holds the key to their survival, for it is governed by an ancient law left behind by the old world\u2019s technology: every perfectly square patch of even size in the Grid must shimmer with an oddly charged number of lit spots, ensuring the energy flows correctly to sustain the camp.\n\nYet, while the Grid\u2019s expanse can be unimaginably large\u2014stretching up to a million squares in total\u2014the camp elders admit the rules only hold true up to this vast scope, beyond which chaos reigns absolutely. Their tradition forbids more columns than rows, always balancing the camp layout under the principle that the width shall never trump the height. Each spot in the Grid is either illuminated or darkened, symbolized by a 1 or a 0 in their records, precisely depicting the current state of each cell in every row of the camp\u2019s layout.\n\nThe problem looms grim: many of the Grid\u2019s current states are flawed\u2014the even-square patches often carry a number of lit cells that is even, breaking the sacred oddness requirement. The elders face a challenge: to change the minimum number of these spots from lit to dark or vice versa, restoring balance so every even-side square patch gleams with an odd tally of lights. If such balance proves impossible from their starting pattern, the elders mark the whole endeavor as hopeless, signaling that no rearrangement of lighting can satisfy the conditions without collapsing the order. This task requires interpreting the camp\u2019s layout input\u2014a precise count of rows and columns first written out on a line, followed by each row\u2019s record of zeros and ones on separate lines\u2014and determining the least number of adjustments, or the impossibility thereof, to cleanse the Grid\u2019s spirit and reinstate the sacred oddness.\n\nAs an example, consider a small Grid three rows tall and wide, whose lights flicker imperfectly as the elders inspect: changing just two of these lights\u2014dousing one where a light burns and igniting one dim spot\u2014can restore the odd-count glow to every even-sided square patch. Yet, for a larger camp spanning seven rows and fifteen columns, the flaws run too deeply; the elders confess no sequence of changes can unlock victory in that vast tapestry of light and shadow, rendering restoration impossible.\n\nIn this shattered land, every line of input marks a vital passage in their survival log\u2014the first with the sizes binding the camp\u2019s Grid, the next with the detailed map of lights, row by row. Their output must solemnly declare a single number: the smallest count of flickerings needed to reach the sacred odd truth, or a bleak negative sign refusing salvation where none can be wrought. In this way, the elders chart their desperate struggle to keep the flickering light of hope alive amid the ruins, one carefully balanced Grid at a time.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nA binary matrix is called good if every even length square sub-matrix has an odd number of ones.\n\nGiven a binary matrix a consisting of n rows and m columns, determine the minimum number of cells you need to change to make it good, or report that there is no way to make it good at all.\n\nAll the terms above have their usual meanings\u00a0\u2014 refer to the Notes section for their formal definitions.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of input contains two integers n and m (1 \\leq n \\leq m \\leq 10^6 and n\\cdot m \\leq 10^6) \u00a0\u2014 the number of rows and columns in a, respectively.\n\nThe following n lines each contain m characters, each of which is one of 0 and 1. If the j-th character on the i-th line is 1, then a_{i,j} = 1. Similarly, if the j-th character on the i-th line is 0, then a_{i,j} = 0.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput the minimum number of cells you need to change to make a good, or output -1 if it's not possible at all.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 3\n101\n001\n110\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n\nSample Input 2\n\n7 15\n000100001010010\n100111010110001\n101101111100100\n010000111111010\n111010010100001\n000011001111101\n111111011010011\n\nSample Output 2\n\n-1\n\nNote\nIn the first case, changing a_{1,1} to 0 and a_{2,2} to 1 is enough.\n\nYou can verify that there is no way to make the matrix in the second case good.\n\nSome definitions\u00a0\u2014\n\n- A binary matrix is one in which every element is either 1 or 0.\n- A sub-matrix is described by 4 parameters\u00a0\u2014 r_1, r_2, c_1, and c_2; here, 1 \\leq r_1 \\leq r_2 \\leq n and 1 \\leq c_1 \\leq c_2 \\leq m.\n- This sub-matrix contains all elements a_{i,j} that satisfy both r_1 \\leq i \\leq r_2 and c_1 \\leq j \\leq c_2.\n- A sub-matrix is, further, called an even length square if r_2-r_1 = c_2-c_1 and r_2-r_1+1 is divisible by 2.",

        "question_title": "Divide Square",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the heart of a vast city, a grand Lantern Festival was celebrated every year upon the great Square of Lights\u2014a colossal plaza stretching far and wide, as if it measured a million steps from one edge to the other. Its corners were mythical beacons: the southwestern, northwestern, southeastern, and northeastern points, each marking the boundary of this luminous field, glowing with the hope of thousands.\n\nAs part of the festival\u2019s tradition, artisans drew glowing threads across the square. These threads could only flow directly from east to west or north to south, never diagonally, and every thread was anchored so firmly it always brushed against the radiant boundaries of the Square of Lights. No two threads unwittingly overlapped along the exact same line in the air, ensuring each radiant streak was unique and clear. The artisans labored to string many such threads: some laced horizontally at elevated heights, each thread stretching between two precise points along the east-west axis without ever touching the very edges; others soared vertically between two points on the north-south axis, again carefully avoiding placement at the extreme edges. Every single thread began or ended at, or brushed against, the grand edges of the square\u2014the sacred perimeter where tradition dictated all activity must intersect.\n\nThe question that puzzled even the most venerable lantern masters was this: after all these horizontal and vertical glowing threads were hung, how many distinct glowing compartments would the Square of Lights be split into? Each thread\u2019s position\u2014the height at which a horizontal one shimmered, the vertical position of a vertical thread, and their respective span between two points\u2014contributed to breaking the vast field into smaller radiant enclaves. Because the threads never overlapped precisely along one horizontal or vertical line more than once, each one guaranteed a unique division. The task was to count these compartments, as every enclave was destined to house its own symphony of lanterns and celebrations. The ultimate goal: maximize understanding of the divisions from the threads, counting every glowing chamber carved by intersections and bounds.\n\nThe lantern masters took daily accounts. The records first listed how many horizontal threads there were, followed by the number of vertical strands woven through the night sky. Then, for each horizontal thread, a trio of numbers described its glow: the altitude of the thread above the ground, and the points along the eastern and western edges it anchored between\u2014strictly above zero but below the square\u2019s full height. Following that, for each vertical thread, the chronicles detailed its exact horizontal position, and its lower and upper limits within the square\u2019s bounds\u2014again, always strictly between zero and the edge. No two threads in the same orientation shared exactly the same altitude or longitude, ensuring uniqueness. Every thread was guaranteed to touch a boundary of the square, anchoring the network firmly to the outer edges. With this data, the masters would calculate the total number of enclosed glowing rooms inside the square after all threads were set.\n\nFor instance, on one memorable night, the records showed three horizontal glowing threads: one hung just above the ground at a height of two steps, spanning from the third step on the western edge all the way to the very northern boundary; another at a modest height of four steps, reaching only from the western edge to the fourth step eastward; and a third glimmering at three steps high, stretching entirely from the western boundary to the northern edge. In the same night, three vertical threads rose: one positioned four steps east, spanning from the very southern edge to the first step upward; another at two steps east, rising from the southern edge to five steps up; and the last at three steps east, glowing from one step upward all the way to the upper northern boundary. After these threads were cast, the Lantern Festival chronicles solemnly noted that the great Square of Lights was carved into seven brilliant, distinct glowing sanctuaries.\n\nThus, the tale of glowing threads across the boundless square came to a pause\u2014not merely a story of lines, but of divisions in the light, guiding the festival\u2019s spirit. With every new thread strung and every new enclave counted, the cityfolk celebrated not just each glowing chamber, but the artful harmony stitched between the edges of their grand plaza and the vibrant threads in between.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nThere is a square of size 10^6 \\times 10^6 on the coordinate plane with four points (0, 0), (0, 10^6), (10^6, 0), and (10^6, 10^6) as its vertices.\n\nYou are going to draw segments on the plane. All segments are either horizontal or vertical and intersect with at least one side of the square.\n\nNow you are wondering how many pieces this square divides into after drawing all segments. Write a program calculating the number of pieces of the square.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (0 \\le n, m \\le 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of horizontal segments and the number of vertical segments.\n\nThe next n lines contain descriptions of the horizontal segments. The i-th line contains three integers y_i, lx_i and rx_i (0 < y_i < 10^6; 0 \\le lx_i < rx_i \\le 10^6), which means the segment connects (lx_i, y_i) and (rx_i, y_i).\n\nThe next m lines contain descriptions of the vertical segments. The i-th line contains three integers x_i, ly_i and ry_i (0 < x_i < 10^6; 0 \\le ly_i < ry_i \\le 10^6), which means the segment connects (x_i, ly_i) and (x_i, ry_i).\n\nIt's guaranteed that there are no two segments on the same line, and each segment intersects with at least one of square's sides.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the number of pieces the square is divided into after drawing all the segments.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 3\n2 3 1000000\n4 0 4\n3 0 1000000\n4 0 1\n2 0 5\n3 1 1000000\n\nSample Output 1\n\n7\n\nNote\nThe sample is like this:",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nFor more than a century, the realm of Runestone Puzzle Trials had wrestled with the enigmatic Bubble Cup hypothesis, a legendary enigma that promised to crown any solver with the title of the greatest mathematician of the era. Among those captivated was Jerry Mao, a sage known far and wide. After ceaseless journeys through cryptic scripts and mysterious glyphs, Jerry distilled this fabled challenge into a puzzle of arcane numerics and mystical runes: the spell-like polynomials inscribed with coefficients chosen solely from a sacred octet of runes representing the numbers zero through seven.\n\nIn the grand archives, it was decreed that each of these polynomials, when summoned at the power of the twin flames (the number two), must yield a precise mark \u2014 a target number known simply as m. The goal for any adept was to discern just how many distinct spell configurations \u2014 polynomials crafted from these sacred runes \u2014 could conjure the exact power m when the twin flames energized their forms. The coefficients, bound to the octet of allowed runes, whispered no choice beyond those mystical limits. Furthermore, the great Hall of Challenges asserted a sacred rule: the number of trials, or test cases, could be as vast as half a million, each with its unique m, soaring as high as the mightiest mountain reaching beyond ten to the eighteenth power.\n\nYour quest, young puzzle-bearer, is to traverse these trials. First, the hall records how many tests await you in the first scroll \u2014 a single glowing integer revealing the count of challenges ahead. Next, on the following scroll, are the array of mighty target numbers. Each one calls for a deep reckoning: for the number given, how many distinct arrangements of runes, conjuring polynomials formed from the sacred octet, when called with the twin flames, recreate this number exactly? The answers you craft must be written separately for each trial on their own golden tablets. But beware, the ancient texts demand these answers be inscribed modulo the great constant, a towering rune inscribed as 10^9 plus seven, ensuring your responses remain within the realm of feasible comprehension.\n\nFor instance, consider the trials where the twin flame yields the number two, and again where it yields four. For the first, imagine the spells x and 2\u2014both alone yield the exact essence two when the twin flames breathe their power. For the second, the solutions are richer: a spell of squared flames (x^2), a combination of a single flame and two runes (x + 2), a double flame cast twice (2x), and the solitary rune 4. These four distinct conjurations all resonate precisely with the number four, each a testament to the multiplicity of paths the runes offer.\n\nThus, the puzzle lays bare: from the sacred octet of runes, how many distinct polynomials can be woven that, under the twin flame\u2019s blaze, echo the numbers given upon your scrolls? The answers must flow with the elegance and precision worthy of the Bubble Cup, fully honoring all sacred constraints\u2014and having done so, you shall join the pantheon of great mathematicians who dared and triumphed.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nThe Bubble Cup hypothesis stood unsolved for 130 years. Who ever proves the hypothesis will be regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of our time! A famous mathematician Jerry Mao managed to reduce the hypothesis to this problem:\n\nGiven a number m, how many polynomials P with coefficients in set {\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}} have: P(2)=m?\n\nHelp Jerry Mao solve the long standing problem!\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\leq t \\leq 5\\cdot 10^5) - number of test cases.\n\nOn next line there are t numbers, m_i (1 \\leq m_i \\leq 10^{18}) - meaning that in case i you should solve for number m_i.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case i, print the answer on separate lines: number of polynomials P as described in statement such that P(2)=m_i, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n2\n2 4\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n4\n\nNote\nIn first case, for m=2, polynomials that satisfy the constraint are x and 2.\n\nIn second case, for m=4, polynomials that satisfy the constraint are x^2, x + 2, 2x and 4.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the vast realm of dream weaving, you are a Dream Architect entrusted with crafting the richest, most vibrant dreamscape possible. Before you lie **n** shimmering threads of dreams, each one unfolding in a gentle, non-decreasing cadence of luminous fragments. These fragments\u2014like radiant beads\u2014grow brighter or stay the same in intensity as they stretch onward. Each thread holds a sequence of these glowing pearls, nonnegative in their brilliance, waiting to be plucked one by one.\n\nYou possess the powers to reach into these dream threads exactly **k** times. Each time, you must delve into the start of any single thread, pluck the very first glowing fragment, and place it carefully into your dream pocket. Once seized, this fragment vanishes from the thread, advancing the thread onward to the next fragment. You cannot skip fragments within a thread, as the flow of the dream always moves sequentially from front to back. It is known in your craft that the total count of fragments across all threads is vast\u2014up to one million\u2014ensuring the dream world is richly detailed, yet your actions\u2014numbering up to three thousand\u2014are precise and deliberate.\n\nYour challenge, as a master Dream Architect, is to devise the ultimate strategy: from these many threads of ascending light, to select which fragments to seize in each of the precisely **k** plucks so that the sum total of their luminous power in your pocket is as grand as possible. Your goal is not simply to collect any fragments, but to maximize the glowing wealth gathered across those plucks, weaving a dream so vibrant no other could match.\n\nThe way the dream unfolds in your scroll of commands is as follows: The first line reveals two whole numbers\u2014the count of threads and the total number of plucks you may perform. Then, each line after that describes one thread. It begins with a single number showing how many fragments the thread holds, followed directly by the glowing strengths of each fragment, arranged in the non-decreasing order dream logic demands. You must immerse yourself in these threads and return, in a single mighty number, the greatest sum of glow you can secure after completing your **k** chosen plucks.\n\nTo illuminate your quest, consider this example of three threads and three plucks allowed:\n\n- The first thread holds two fragments, glowing at strengths five and then ten.\n- The second stretches longer, with three fragments shining at one, then two, then three.\n- The third thread has two fragments, dimly glowing at one then bursting at twenty.\n\nIf you pluck from these threads such that your pocket holds the richest combination after three moves, your total brightness will climb to twenty-six\u2014a sum wrought by the sharp intuition of selecting the brightest fragments first without breaking the sequential harmony of each thread.\n\nThus, as Dream Architect, you hold the power to dive selectively into these threads and emerge with pockets brimming with luminous gems\u2014maximizing brilliance, and shaping wondrous reveries across the boundless dreamscape.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given n non-decreasing arrays of non-negative numbers.\n\nVasya repeats the following operation k times:\n\n- Selects a non-empty array.\n- Puts the first element of the selected array in his pocket.\n- Removes the first element from the selected array.\n\nVasya wants to maximize the sum of the elements in his pocket.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \\le n, k \\le 3\\,000): the number of arrays and operations.\n\nEach of the next n lines contain an array. The first integer in each line is t_i (1 \\le t_i \\le 10^6): the size of the i-th array. The following t_i integers a_{i, j} (0 \\le a_{i, 1} \\le \\ldots \\le a_{i, t_i} \\le 10^8) are the elements of the i-th array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that k \\le \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n t_i \\le 10^6.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint one integer: the maximum possible sum of all elements in Vasya's pocket after k operations.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 3\n2 5 10\n3 1 2 3\n2 1 20\n\nSample Output 1\n\n26",

        "question_title": "Distinctive Roots in a Tree",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the delicate and precise world of clockmaking, nestled deep within the intricate cogs and wheels, there exists a sprawling mechanism known as The Everbranch Tree. This tree is no ordinary plant but a magnificent structure of interconnected gears\u2014each gear bearing a unique engraving, a symbol that defines its essence. The Everbranch Tree is composed of a count of gears, counting no more than two hundred thousand, linked together by invisible threads of motion, ensuring that the whole works as one unyielding clockwork entity. Each gear\u2019s engraving is a number, sometimes grand as a billion, symbolizing its unique nature in the mechanism\u2019s design.\n\nAmong the artisans, it is said that a \"Distinctive Root\" is a special gear from which if one traces the winding paths along the Everbranch Tree, the engravings encountered on every stride forward must never repeat along that singular journey. One may meander through many routes beginning at this root gear, but every single route carries only unique engravings, making that gear truly distinctive. This does not forbid the family resemblance between different paths sprouting from the root; only that no path can bear repeated signs within itself. The challenge the clockmakers face is to identify how many such distinctive roots exist in this grand structure, for resting the mechanism\u2019s essence upon such points ensures perfect harmony and uniqueness in motion.\n\nThe task is thus laid bare amidst the ticking hands and shimmering brass: from the record provided\u2014which first declares the total number of gears and then lists their inscriptions\u2014the artisans enumerate the countless links that bind these gears into a seamless tree. Each link is noted by the pair of gears it connects, ensuring that no loops or redundancies cloud their calculation. With this knowledge, one must explore every gear\u2019s potential to serve as this hallowed distinct root. Not merely to find one, but to reckon precisely how many possess this honor, a count that sings of order and clarity in the grand design. This pursuit is not just a search for existence, but for full measure of perfection\u2014seeking the utmost tally of these unique points within the clockwork.\n\nTo inscribe the input into the artisan\u2019s log, one begins with a single line declaring the total number of gears, followed on the very next line by a list\u2014a parade of the engravings assigned to each gear in the ordained order. Following this, the artisan writes out the ties between gears, one link per line, each naming the pair that binds them. The output they seek is simple yet profound: a single figure, standing alone on a line, declaring how many of these gears qualify as distinctive roots.\n\nConsider then the first test: five gears aligned with engravings two, five, one, one, and four. The connections draw the skeletal Everbranch: gear one linked to gears two and three; gear two connected further to gears four and five. Here, the artisans find three worthy roots\u2014gears one, two, and five\u2014each giving rise to unique paths where no engraving repeats along a journey. Yet, the second test tells a different tale. Though the structure remains unchanged, the inscriptions shift to two, one, one, one, and four. This subtle change seals the fate: no gear may claim the mantle of distinctive root, for everywhere, duplications mar the path\u2019s integrity.\n\nThus, within the clockmaker\u2019s tome, the dance of gears and engravings reflects a profound harmony challenge\u2014searching every node for that perfect, distinct beginning, weaving through paths where repetition is the enemy, and uniqueness the treasure. The number of such noble roots, carefully tallied, marks the difference between a mere assembly and a masterpiece of time.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a tree with n vertices. Each vertex i has a value a_i associated with it.\n\nLet us root the tree at some vertex v. The vertex v is called a distinctive root if the following holds: in all paths that start at v and end at some other node, all the values encountered are distinct. Two different paths may have values in common but a single path must have all distinct values.\n\nFind the number of distinctive roots in the tree.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe next line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9).\n\nThe following n-1 lines each contain two space-separated integers u and v (1 \\le u, v \\le n), denoting an edge from u to v.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the edges form a tree.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of distinctive roots in the tree.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n2 5 1 1 4\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5\n2 1 1 1 4\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n\nSample Output 2\n\n0\n\nNote\nIn the first example, 1, 2 and 5 are distinctive roots.",

        "question_title": "Smile House",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the ancient realm of the Smile House, there lay a complex labyrinth\u2014an enchanted mansion with a certain number of chambers, each pulsating with mysterious energies. These chambers could be thought of as rooms arranged throughout the mansion, and between some pairs of rooms, ornate doors linked them. Travelers in this house could move from one chamber to another through these doors, and each door whispered secrets about how the traveler\u2019s spirit might brighten or darken upon crossing. Every pair of connected chambers shared two different energies: one that would influence moving forward from the first chamber to the second, and another that affected movement the opposite way.\n\nThe wise wanderer Petya sought to understand the mansion\u2019s magic deeply. He wondered if it was possible, by traveling through a series of connected chambers that looped back to the starting point, to infinitely lift his spirits \u2014 amassing boundless joy as he traversed the cycle repeatedly. Such a loop would not be just any journey but a perfect circuit where the total joy gained stepping from room to room would be endlessly positive, elevating the mood without limit. Within the laws of this enchanted manor, Petya needed to uncover the shortest possible chain of rooms\u2014counting even repeated visits if needed\u2014that would produce this infinite exhilaration. If no such cycle existed, then the mansion held no such secret.\n\nTo test this, one would start by knowing how many chambers the mansion contained and how many doors linked pairs of these chambers. Each door was uniquely identified by the pair of connected chambers, and along with these, the twin values of energy gains or losses when traversing from one room to the other in either direction were noted. The first line of Petya\u2019s record would reveal two numbers: the total count of chambers in the mansion and the total count of connecting doors. Then, for each door, a detailed account followed on its own line\u2014listing the two chambers it connected, and the pair of energy shifts applicable when moving either way between them.\n\nPetya\u2019s quest was to determine the smallest number of chambers he would have to visit in such a joyous infinite loop. If the mansion held no such cycle that could raise his mood endlessly, the answer would be that no count of chambers could ever achieve this joy\u2014that is, zero. His goal was not merely to discover the existence of such a cycle but to find the one with the most efficient length for eternal happiness.\n\nFor example, consider a mansion with four chambers connected by four doors. Each door specifies the chambers it joins and the energy boosts or drains in either direction. In this scenario, an infinite uplifting cycle would require visiting all four chambers in a circuit, thus the smallest such joyful path stretches across all four rooms. Hence, the answer is four. However, if no such magical path were possible, the answer would be zero, indicating that Petya\u2019s spirit could not be infinitely raised within the mansion\u2019s confines.\n\nThus, Petya\u2019s puzzle came to life: given the dimensions of the mansion and the energies between chambers, he had to seek the smallest cycle of rooms bringing eternal joy or realize such a cycle did not dwell within the enchanted labyrinth at all.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nA smile house is created to raise the mood. It has n rooms. Some of the rooms are connected by doors. For each two rooms (number i and j), which are connected by a door, Petya knows their value cij \u2014 the value which is being added to his mood when he moves from room i to room j.\n\nPetya wondered whether he can raise his mood infinitely, moving along some cycle? And if he can, then what minimum number of rooms he will need to visit during one period of a cycle?\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 \\leq n \\leq 300, 0 \\leq m \\leq \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}), where n is the number of rooms, and m is the number of doors in the Smile House. Then follows the description of the doors: m lines each containing four integers i, j, cij \u0438 cji (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, i \u2260 j, - 104 \u2264 cij, cji \u2264 104). It is guaranteed that no more than one door connects any two rooms. No door connects the room with itself.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the minimum number of rooms that one needs to visit during one traverse of the cycle that can raise mood infinitely. If such cycle does not exist, print number 0.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4 4\n1 2 -10 3\n1 3 1 -10\n2 4 -10 -1\n3 4 0 -3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n4\n\nNote\nCycle is such a sequence of rooms a1, a2, ..., ak, that a1 is connected with a2, a2 is connected with a3, ..., ak - 1 is connected with ak, ak is connected with a1. Some elements of the sequence can coincide, that is, the cycle should not necessarily be simple. The number of rooms in the cycle is considered as k, the sequence's length. Note that the minimum possible length equals two.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the Collaborative Task Scheduling Center, there exists a nuanced and intricate game that all coordinators must master. Each player faces a series of daily reports from different departments, where each report arrives as a seamless array of integers\u2014think of them as the official figures sent by various teams. These reports have a certain magical quality: for every position in the list, the coordinators must assign their own numbers that meet a very special condition. This ritual of assignment, known as forming a \u201chybrid chain,\u201d ensures full synchronization in the grand scheme of planning.\n\nThe secret of the hybrid chain lies in a dual-rule harmony. For every spot in the report, the coordinator\u2019s chosen value must either exactly echo the incoming number at that position or perfectly match the total sum of all coordinator numbers up to that point. This rule means that each chosen number is like a dual-natured key\u2014it either reflects the present or resonates with the accumulated history of choices. The land\u2019s law is strict: every single index must respect at least one of these twin commandments to keep the chain valid. The complexity grows as the number of entries stretches into the hundreds of thousands, and the integers themselves swing widely from deep negatives to high positives, reflecting the chaotic energies of the workplace.\n\nThe coordinators face many rounds of this balancing act. They begin by learning how many test cycles of these reports they will face\u2014each cycle revealing how many numbers the report will contain and then presenting the daunting array itself. Their ultimate quest? To count, as fully and efficiently as possible, all the distinct valid hybrid chains they might weave from these reports. Because the numbers can explode in variety, the Counting Guild requires the final tally to be whispered in a special mystical code: the remainder after dividing by a large prime, precisely one billion and seven\u2014a sacred number known to keep chaos tamed in their calculations.\n\nTo lay it out plainly, each trial starts with stating how many daily cycles they must endure. For each cycle, the next declaration is how long the report array is, followed by the array numbers themselves, spread across a line. The finish line is a single number for each cycle: the count of all ways the coordinator can choose their numbers\u2014those hybrid chains\u2014that meet the commanding dual-rule standard, whispered in the Guild\u2019s sacred modular tongue.\n\nLet\u2019s step through some of the lore\u2019s greatest recorded trials. In one, with a trio of numbers [1, -1, 1], three hybrid chains surface\u2014mirrored by arrays like [1, -2, 1] or subtly shifted renditions that satisfy the balance of present and cumulative echoes. In another, with a report of four booming numbers [1, 2, 3, 4], a rich chorus of eight hybrid chains emerges, each blending the values through creative yet lawful choices. More astounding is the tenfold challenge, where 223 such chains dance in harmony, reflecting complexity without despair. Lastly, a simpler yet rigid case of [0, 0, 0, 1] yields but one unique chain, underscoring that sometimes, the path through the rules is narrow and precise. In all these tales, the coordinators strive not just to obey but to maximize their harmony, embodying the essence of the Collaborative Task Scheduling Center\u2019s spirit.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array of integers b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n.\n\nAn array a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n of integers is hybrid if for each i (1 \\leq i \\leq n) at least one of these conditions is true:\n\n- b_i = a_i, or\n- b_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} a_j.\n\nFind the number of hybrid arrays a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n. As the result can be very large, you should print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n (-10^9 \\le b_i \\le 10^9).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single integer: the number of hybrid arrays a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4\n3\n1 -1 1\n4\n1 2 3 4\n10\n2 -1 1 -2 2 3 -5 0 2 -1\n4\n0 0 0 1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3\n8\n223\n1\n\nNote\nIn the first test case, the hybrid arrays are [1, -2, 1], [1, -2, 2], [1, -1, 1].\n\nIn the second test case, the hybrid arrays are [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 4], [1, 1, 3, -1], [1, 1, 3, 4], [1, 2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0, 4], [1, 2, 3, -2], [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\nIn the fourth test case, the only hybrid array is [0, 0, 0, 1].",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn an ancient realm forgotten by time, there existed a sprawling enchanted forest, revered by the lost civilization as the Tree of Ages. This immense arboreal marvel stretched across the land with **N** eternal nodes\u2014each a sacred point where the spirit of the forest whispered secrets. These nodes were interconnected by **N minus one** shimmering branches, each branch binding two nodes in timeless harmony and ensuring that the forest formed one unbroken living entity with no loops\u2014an everlasting tree alive with whispers and power.\n\nAmidst this mystical labyrinth, the civilization's elders performed the Number Rituals, invoking **M** sacred journey paths carved through the Tree of Ages. Each path was not just a route, but a spiritual passage that traced the shortest journey between two chosen nodes, touching upon every spirit-imbued point in between. These paths were revered for their symbolism and power, their intersections believed to hold profound significance. Yet, there were strict customs: the elders sought to count annually how many pairs of these sacred passages intersected at exactly one singular node, a solitary convergence point symbolizing unique bonds of fate\u2014no more, no less.\n\nThe ritual\u2019s challenge was clear: given the sacred forest\u2019s structure and the **M** paths known to the elders, determine precisely how many pairs of distinct paths merged at exactly one vertex, no more, no less. Two paths that shared a single sacred node represented a harmonious but fragile link, while those sharing many nodes or none at all missed the mark of this unique ritual. The elders sought the most complete tally\u2014measuring the sacred intersections as fully and as efficiently as the ancient mathematics of their world allowed, for the statue they carved would enshrine the number forever.\n\nTo begin, the ritual scroll would be read aloud with a precise cadence: first, a single number revealed the count of nodes cradled in the tree's living frame, a figure never exceeding three hundred thousand\u2014the upper limit of their numerical reverence. Then, on the next **N minus one** lines, the links between these nodes were declared in pairs, each line describing the sacred connection between two distinct points. Following these, a solitary line pronounced the number of sacred paths **M**, again bound by the ancient limit of three hundred thousand to preserve cosmic balance. Then, on the next **M** lines, each path\u2019s start and end nodes were uttered aloud, defining a passage through the forest\u2019s heart via the shortest spiritual route.\n\nAt the ritual\u2019s culmination, the elders would reveal a single integer\u2014an emblem of their calculation\u2014counting the sacred pairs whose paths intersected at exactly one sacred node. This number represented the ritual\u2019s profound insight, reflecting the unique shared whispers of the Tree of Ages.\n\nConsider a simpler era: a forest with five sacred nodes linked like branches to the ancient heart. Four ritual paths were proclaimed:\n- From node 2 to node 3,\n- From node 2 to node 4,\n- From node 3 to node 4,\n- From node 3 to node 5.\n\nHere, only two pairs of paths converged at exactly one node\u2014the pairs (first path with fourth path) and (third path with fourth path). In a more minimalist forest with but a single node and three paths all beginning and ending there, every pair of paths shared that solitary vertex exactly once, resulting in three sacred pairs. Expanding once more to the first forest but with two additional ritual paths (one confined to the root node itself, another stretching from the root to node 2), the elders counted seven pairs whose paths mingled only once at a singular node, highlighting the intricate dance of their ancient rituals.\n\nThrough these elaborate rites, the lost civilization reached beyond mere counting\u2014they embraced the essence of connection, tuning into the ancient forest\u2019s whispered lore. Each number revealed was more than math; it was the eternal rhythm of intersecting fates within the living Tree of Ages.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a tree consisting of n vertices, and m simple vertex paths. Your task is to find how many pairs of those paths intersect at exactly one vertex. More formally you have to find the number of pairs (i, j) (1 \\leq i < j \\leq m) such that path_i and path_j have exactly one vertex in common.\n\nInput Format\nFirst line contains a single integer n (1 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5).\n\nNext n - 1 lines describe the tree. Each line contains two integers u and v (1 \\leq u, v \\leq n) describing an edge between vertices u and v.\n\nNext line contains a single integer m (1 \\leq m \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5).\n\nNext m lines describe paths. Each line describes a path by it's two endpoints u and v (1 \\leq u, v \\leq n). The given path is all the vertices on the shortest path from u to v (including u and v).\n\nOutput Format\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the number of pairs of paths that intersect at exactly one vertex.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n3 5\n4\n2 3\n2 4\n3 4\n3 5\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n\nSample Input 2\n\n1\n3\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n\nSample Output 2\n\n3\n\nSample Input 3\n\n5\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n3 5\n6\n2 3\n2 4\n3 4\n3 5\n1 1\n1 2\n\nSample Output 3\n\n7\n\nNote\nThe tree in the first example and paths look like this. Pairs (1,4) and (3,4) intersect at one vertex.\n\nIn the second example all three paths contain the same single vertex, so all pairs (1, 2), (1, 3) and (2, 3) intersect at one vertex.\n\nThe third example is the same as the first example with two additional paths. Pairs (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) and (5,6) intersect at one vertex.",

        "question_title": "Palindromic Doubles",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the ancient Kingdom of Arithmora, the Royal Census Office had a peculiar tradition: every decade, the kingdom recorded the tales of its citizens, arranged in a grand ledger of numbers. This ledger was not just a record but a living story, where each number represented a unique citizen\u2019s deed and character, woven tightly into the kingdom\u2019s history. Curiously, no citizen\u2019s deed was allowed to be recorded more than twice, in order to preserve the uniqueness of their legacy and avoid repetition in the annals.\n\nDuring the latest census, the Royal Scribes faced a challenging task. They wished to uncover the longest harmonious tale hidden within the great ledger\u2014a tale that reads identically forward and backward, like a song echoing perfectly through the hallways of the castle. This special type of tale is known in Arithmora as a \u201cpalindromic legacy,\u201d a sequence so balanced that one could recite it from start to end or end to start without losing any meaning or rhythm.\n\nEach census report began with the number of separate tales recorded by the kingdom\u2019s observers, which could be as many as one thousand, reflecting the many diverse provinces under the king\u2019s rule. For each tale, the scribe would first write down the length of that particular legacy, which might stretch up to two hundred fifty thousand deeds, showcasing the grandeur of some histories. On the very next line, the scribe detailed the order of each deed \u2014 a sequence of numbers indicating each citizen\u2019s unique contributions. It was well-known among the scribes that no number of a deed could be found more than twice in any sequence, ensuring every palindromic journey was fair and untangled.\n\nThe scribes were then tasked with a grand question: from each tale, find the length of the longest palindromic legacy that could be extracted by selectively removing some deeds without betraying the story\u2019s original order\u2014like trimming a vine while preserving its enchanting symmetry. This meant not just identifying any palindromic achievements, but the grandest and longest, fully embracing the kingdom\u2019s harmonious essence.\n\nTo better understand this quest, the scribes provided sample tales: one lengthy tale carried six deeds, and the longest harmonized legacy was five deeds long; another tale of six deeds offered a palindromic legacy spanning four deeds; among shorter tales, the longest echoed legacies were simply one or two deeds long. Even the richest legacy of seven deeds revealed a balanced harmony of three. These examples illuminated the kingdom\u2019s perfect blends of symmetry and legacy, offering proof that such harmonic tales existed, ready to be discovered in the chronicles.\n\nThus, as the census concluded, the scribes inscribed their final scroll: for each tale recorded, they would inscribe a single number\u2014the measure of its longest symmetrical legacy. In doing so, they preserved not just histories but the rhythms of the kingdom itself, ensuring that the echoes of Arithmora\u2019s past sang eternally in perfect balance.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be obtained from another sequence by removing some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\nA palindromic sequence is a sequence that is equal to the reverse of itself.\n\nYou are given a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n.

The sum of n over all testcases doesn't exceed 250\\,000.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of sequence a.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n6\n2 1 3 1 5 2\n6\n1 3 3 4 4 1\n1\n1\n2\n1 1\n7\n4 4 2 5 7 2 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n5\n4\n1\n2\n3\n\nNote\nHere are the longest palindromic subsequences for the example testcases:\n\n- 2 1 3 1 5 2\n- 1 3 3 4 4 1 or 1 3 3 4 4 1\n- 1\n- 1 1\n- 4 4 2 5 7 2 3 or 4 4 2 5 7 2 3",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\n**Carnival Game Engineering Log: The Quest for the Greatest Harmony**\n\nIn the bustling realm of the Grand Carnival, an illustrious troupe of engineers tended to an array of enchanted wheels, each marked with numbers that defined the power of their spins. There were a grand total of **N** such mystical wheels lined in a row, their original strengths known from the start. Alongside this assembly, the master engineers kept a ledger of **Q** magical activations \u2014 precise instructions to multiply the potency of a certain wheel by a chosen factor, thereby altering its mystical signature.\n\nWithin this carnival\u2019s secret laws, the essence of shared power among all wheels was measured through the Festival\u2019s Harmony \u2014 a revered figure embodying the deepest common strength resonating through every wheel simultaneously. This Harmony was not just a value; it was a symbol that reaffirmed the unity and balance of the entire wheel ensemble. The engineers were tasked not merely with performing their transformations but with discerning the highest possible common strength, or the greatest common divisor, across all wheels after each magical multiplication moved the balance anew. To maintain cosmic equilibrium and avoid overflowing the bounds of reality, this Harmony would always be expressed modulo a mystical prime, a vault number written deep within the carnival scrolls as 1,000,000,007.\n\nThe rules that governed this enchanted operation were clear: the engineers could order their activations only a handful of times, nowhere near exceeding two hundred thousand changes, and similarly, the number of wheels would stay under that very threshold. Each wheel\u2019s initial prowess was no more than two hundred thousand but never less than the humble strength of one. When an activation was called, a specific wheel\u2019s spirit was multiplied by the strength designated by the command, which itself never surpassed the same glorious limit. After each such invocation, the engineers needed to decode the Festival\u2019s Harmony \u2014 the greatest power that evenly resonated within all wheels at once \u2014 respecting the mystical prime's embrace.\n\nUpon receiving the initial scroll, the engineers would first read the size of this magical array and the number of forthcoming activation commands. Next, the very fabric of the initial powers of each wheel would be inscribed. Following this, each of the **Q** activations would be revealed one by one\u2014on each new line, the target wheel\u2019s position in the row, and the power by which it should be amplified. Their response was a sacred chant of numbers: one for each activation, expressing the Festival\u2019s Harmony numeric essence as constrained by the prime.\n\nConsider an example from their records: four wheels stood with powers [1, 6, 8, 12]. The engineers summoned three activations in order: first, the initial wheel was magnified by 12, turning the array to [12, 6, 8, 12]. The Festival\u2019s Harmony was then 2, the highest power universally present in all wheels, snug within the prime\u2019s confines. Next, increasing the second wheel\u2019s magic trespassed by a factor of 3, yielding [12, 18, 8, 12] and sustaining the Harmony at 2. Finally, the third wheel\u2019s might was tripled to form [12, 18, 24, 12], and now, a richer common strength of 6 rose to prominence, again fitting perfectly under the mystical prime\u2019s watch.\n\nThus, the engineers\u2019 challenge was to maintain the balance, maximizing this shared power after every transformation, ensuring their magical carnival wheels spun in unity, their collective spirit echoed faithfully in every chant of the Festival\u2019s Harmony, forever reverberating within the laws of the grand prime.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array a of length n. You are asked to process q queries of the following format: given integers i and x, multiply a_i by x.\n\nAfter processing each query you need to output the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements of the array a.\n\nSince the answer can be too large, you are asked to output it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers \u2014 n and q (1 \\le n, q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5) \u2014 the elements of the array a before the changes.\n\nThe next q lines contain queries in the following format: each line contains two integers i and x (1 \\le i \\le n, 1 \\le x \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint q lines: after processing each query output the GCD of all elements modulo 10^9+7 on a separate line.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4 3\n1 6 8 12\n1 12\n2 3\n3 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n2\n6\n\nNote\nAfter the first query the array is [12, 6, 8, 12], \\operatorname{gcd}(12, 6, 8, 12) = 2.\n\nAfter the second query \u2014 [12, 18, 8, 12], \\operatorname{gcd}(12, 18, 8, 12) = 2.\n\nAfter the third query \u2014 [12, 18, 24, 12], \\operatorname{gcd}(12, 18, 24, 12) = 6.\n\nHere the \\operatorname{gcd} function denotes the greatest common divisor.",

        "question_title": "The Number of Pairs",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the shadowy world of corporate espionage, a clandestine agency operates under strict codes of resource allocation and information flow. Within this agency, there are three key operational parameters: the code strength, the defensive barriers, and a mysterious encrypted variable that measures incoming threats. Each is represented by a positive whole number\u2014never zero, as zero would imply absence and thus vulnerability. The agency\u2019s tradecraft depends heavily on correctly balancing these parameters to optimize covert missions.\n\nThe agency\u2019s intelligence officers are tasked with identifying pairs of secret agents, each with their own unique operational capacity and secrecy level, both positive integers greater than zero. The agency\u2019s internal logic dictates a delicate equation that these two agents must satisfy to be approved for critical assignments. Specifically, the code strength, when multiplied by the combined operational influence of the two agents (measured as the least common influence they share), minus the defensive barriers, when multiplied by the measure of their shared vulnerabilities (greatest shared weak point), must perfectly equal the encrypted threat score. This formula is sacrosanct and only pairs that strictly obey it are mission-worthy.\n\nBehind the scenes, this breaks down as a puzzle: given batches of mission parameters\u2014each batch containing a code strength, a defensive barrier, and an encrypted threat score\u2014the officers must determine how many distinct pairs of agents exist that satisfy the formula. Mission parameters arrive as a series of test cases, each describing these three key values on a single line. The number of these tunings (test cases) can be very large, up to ten thousand, and each value in the triplet can climb as high as ten million, making the task computationally intense. The goal is not just to find some pairs but to account for every possible pair, maximizing operational scope within these strict constraints.\n\nThe input transmissions come as follows: the first line reveals how many mission parameter sets need analysis. Then, on each subsequent line, the three crucial numbers for one mission set are received in a row\u2014first code strength, then defensive barrier, and finally the encrypted threat level. For every mission set, the analysts must output a single line number that declares how many unique agent pairs pass the test\u2019s formula. These pairs are counted considering every valid combination of positive integers agent capacities.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a handful of mission sets decoded recently: One with moderate code strength and defensive barriers both equal to one and a threat level of three yielded four perfect agent pairs. Another with heavier code strength and defensive barriers (four and two) facing a threat level of six resulted in only three agent pairs. A more challenging set with both code strength and defenses at three and an odd threat level seven revealed no feasible pairs at all. Finally, a balanced yet intense mission with code strength two, defenses seven, and a higher threat level of twenty-five unearthed eight potential pairs. These findings guide the agency\u2019s strategic decisions and define the fine line between mission success and failure.\n\nIn this world of secrets and numbers, the challenge is clear: for each mission\u2019s three secret parameters, find all pairs of agents whose combined operational synergy and mutual resilience measure up exactly to the encrypted threat letter. Deliver the count, and ensure the agency\u2019s edge remains sharp.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given three positive (greater than zero) integers c, d and x.\n\nYou have to find the number of pairs of positive integers (a, b) such that equality c \\cdot lcm(a, b) - d \\cdot gcd(a, b) = x holds.

The Envoy\u2019s challenge is to embark on an expedition that visits every city in turn, touching each one exactly once, before returning triumphantly to the Prime City, closing the circuit with perfect completeness. Movements from one city to another incur a cost dictated by two intertwined measures: the city's enforced Minimum Passage Cost as the departing city, and the difference in Beauty between the destination and departure. More specifically, when traveling from a given city, the expense is the greater between that city's required toll and the numerical difference obtained by subtracting the departure city\u2019s Beauty from the destination city\u2019s Beauty. The cost, however, does not consider the absolute value of their difference, allowing the formula to skew towards positive or negative increments naturally. The Envoy\u2019s overarching mission is not merely compliance but to discover the path through these Sentient Cities that accumulates the lowest possible total expense for completing the entire loop.\n\nTo initiate the quest, the simulation begins by declaring the total number of Sentient Cities\u2014the magnitude of this world\u2019s landscape\u2014expressed as a singular integer. Following this, the intricate characteristics of each city come forth line by line: each city reveals its numerical Beauty and its Minimum Passage Cost, two essential traits to be woven into the Envoy\u2019s journey calculus. The output, presented as a singular integer, represents the minimum total cost achievable\u2014a herald of the most efficient route the Envoy can chart through the network, satisfying the conditions of completeness and economic prudence.\n\nAs a vivid illustration, imagine a smaller archipelago of three shining domains. The Prime boasts a Beauty of one and demands a lofty passage fee; another is slightly brighter with a low toll, and the third glows more intensely with the smallest minimum fee. When the Envoy charts a course from the first to the brightest, then moves to the moderately bright before looping back to the Prime, the tolls incurred match precisely the higher of the departing city's fee or the positive illumination gap towards the next city. Summed together, these produce the absolute minimal toll sum of eleven. Not a path can unfurl with less exertion of resources, demonstrating the logic and cost mechanics of TerraCircuit.\n\nExpanding this further, contemplate a realm of six diverse glowing domains with varying intense radiances and passage tolls. The Envoy\u2019s optimal route, crafted through the dense weave of these parameters, incurs a total footprint of thirteen. This result echoes the delicate balance the Envoy must attain\u2014navigating through surges of radiant differences and enforced tolls, all while ensuring each city is visited once and only once in this grand circular exploration. Consequently, the challenge set by TerraCircuit is to harness these principles and reveal the path of lowest cumulative burden, a testament to strategic traversal in an ecosystem woven of beauty and cost.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nThere are n cities numbered from 1 to n, and city i has beauty a_i.\n\nA salesman wants to start at city 1, visit every city exactly once, and return to city 1.\n\nFor all i\\ne j, a flight from city i to city j costs \\max(c_i,a_j-a_i) dollars, where c_i is the price floor enforced by city i.

This token may represent discontent, neutrality, or approval, but it must be chosen with care. The power of your voice, whether a fervent opposition or a staunch backing, holds great significance. Its measure, be it positive, negative, or zero, must fit within the bounds our laws have etched\u2014no whispers beyond a hundred steps in either direction.\u201d This decree laid the foundation upon which debates and decisions were sculpted.\n\nYour role, as the envoy of the Guild of Diplomats, is to translate this token into its purest form and present it before the council without alteration\u2014no embellishment or diminishment. The essence of the token must remain intact, faithful to the original sentiment cast by its bearer. The council\u2019s need is simple yet profound: to see the token\u2019s truth clearly and immediately, so they may weigh its influence in shaping Archontria\u2019s fate without confusion or distortion.\n\nThe envoy\u2019s scroll begins with a tender line\u2014the solitary number inscribed to represent the token\u2019s value, constrained within the sacred bounds drawn by the decree. Only after this line, without delay or distraction, must the envoy inscribe a single revealing symbol\u2014an integer that echoes that very number, pure and unwavering. This act symbolizes transparency and integrity in political representation, a gesture both solemn and necessary.\n\nFor example, if the envoy receives a token engraved with a single token of mild approval, like a one, the envoy must return the very same mark\u2014one\u2014unfurled onto the scroll. Conversely, a token of strong disapproval labeled as minus sixteen would be faithfully mirrored, represented exactly as minus sixteen. This ritual preserves the sanctity of the council\u2019s deliberations, neither amplifying nor muting any voice.\n\nThus, through this simple yet sacred exchange, Archontria preserves a delicate harmony, ensuring every political shade, from fiery opposition to silent support, is acknowledged without distortion. By fulfilling this decree, the envoy safeguards the clarity of the realm\u2019s political symphony, enabling each voice to echo as intended in the great halls of power.\n\n### Coding Test format:\n*The two images are equivalent, feel free to use either one.\n\nInput Format\nThe input contains a single integer a (-100 \\le a \\le 100).\n\nOutput Format\nOutput the result - an integer number.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn a faraway land of connected villages, each numbered from zero to a certain grand number less one, the people of the realm devised a legendary challenge known as the Postcard Routing Puzzle. These villages were linked by winding paths, each path connecting exactly two distinct villages, forming a single web so that there was only one way to travel between any two villages without getting lost. The rulers, curious and wise, sought to understand every possible pair of villages and explore the unique identity arising from the set of villages passing along the path that connects them.\n\nThe puzzle was defined by a curious rule about a hidden measure called the \u201cMissing First Number\u201d or MFM. To find the MFM for a pair of villages, one would trace the shortest route between these two endpoints, gathering all the village numbers visited, including the start and end. The MFM was then the smallest whole number starting from zero that wasn\u2019t found in that gathered collection. For example, if all villages along the way had numbers zero and two, but one was absent, the MFM would reveal itself as one\u2014the smallest missing number. The rulers sought not just the MFM but how often each possible MFM from zero up to the total village count occurred among all pairs of villages.\n\nThe Quest itself came with an ancient decree on how the puzzle could be approached: The kingdom announced that many such puzzles would be posed\u2014each involving various configurations of villages linked by paths. For each puzzle, the kingdom would reveal the total number of villages first, followed by a series of lines specifying pairs of villages connected directly by paths. It was assured that these straight connections always formed one continuous network, avoiding cycles or isolation. The sum of all villages across the many puzzles would never surpass a vast but manageable number, allowing the wisest counselors ample time to analyze all possible pairs.\n\nTasked with this challenge, the seekers had one clear mission: For every puzzle presented, they must find and declare, in order, the count of village pairs whose shortest path\u2019s MFM equals zero, the count for one, then two, all the way up to the count equal to the total number of villages, that is, the maximum possible MFM for that network. These counts had to be presented as a sequence on one line, clearly showing the distribution of all pairs by their MFM\u2014a sacred tally revealing the intricate structure of village connections and the gaps between numbers along the paths.\n\nConsider the example when two puzzles were presented. The first had four villages arranged so that village zero was linked to villages one and two, then village two connected further to village three. The counts of pairs by their MFM appeared as: one pair with MFM zero, two pairs with MFM one, one with MFM two, one with MFM three, and one with MFM four. The second puzzle had only two villages linked directly, resulting in zero pairs with MFM zero and one, but one pair with MFM two, reflecting the direct and simple connection. The conclusive notation carried this clarity forward, guiding all who dared to unravel the complex dance of numbers and paths.\n\nIn this mysterious world of paths and missing numbers, the postcard routing travellers strove not merely to list paths but to reveal the essence of every journey\u2019s missing step, capturing the pulse of their connected realm\u2019s numeric heartbeat with precision and breadth.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a tree with n nodes, numerated from 0 to n-1. For each k between 0 and n, inclusive, you have to count the number of unordered pairs (u,v), u \\neq v, such that the MEX of all the node labels in the shortest path from u to v (including end points) is k.\n\nThe MEX of a sequence of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the sequence.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^{5}).\n\nThe next n-1 lines of each test case describe the tree that has to be constructed. These lines contain two integers u and v (0 \\le u,v \\le n-1) denoting an edge between u and v (u \\neq v).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nIt is also guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot 10^{5}.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print n+1 integers: the number of paths in the tree, such that the MEX of all the node labels in that path is k for each k from 0 to n.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n2\n4\n0 1\n0 2\n2 3\n2\n1 0\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1 2 1 1 1 \n0 0 1\n\nNote\n1. In example case 1, For k = 0, there is 1 path that is from 2 to 3 as MEX([2, 3]) = 0. For k = 1, there are 2 paths that is from 0 to 2 as MEX([0, 2]) = 1 and 0 to 3 as MEX([0, 2, 3]) = 1. For k = 2, there is 1 path that is from 0 to 1 as MEX([0, 1]) = 2. For k = 3, there is 1 path that is from 1 to 2 as MEX([1, 0, 2]) = 3 For k = 4, there is 1 path that is from 1 to 3 as MEX([1, 0, 2, 3]) = 4.\n2. In example case 2, For k = 0, there are no such paths. For k = 1, there are no such paths. For k = 2, there is 1 path that is from 0 to 1 as MEX([0, 1]) = 2.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the high-stakes world of E-Sports tournament arenas, a unique competition unfolds across an interconnected network of gaming arenas known simply as \"The Grid.\" Each arena hosts a player with a current skill rating, representing their prowess in the ongoing championship. Adjacent arenas are connected by direct portals, allowing strategic exchanges that can enhance or diminish the skill levels of both participants simultaneously. The Grid is always fully connected, meaning every arena is reachable through some path of portals, ensuring no competitor is isolated from the energetic ebb and flow of the tournament.\n\nThe tournament\u2019s rules decree that during each operation, a coordinator selects a portal linking exactly two arenas. They then impose a skill adjustment, either positive or negative, that is instantly added to the skill ratings of both competitors connected by that portal. These adjustments may be repeated any finite number of times, or even not at all, as long as they abide by the rule of always affecting pairs connected by a portal. The ultimate goal for the coordinators is to determine if, through a clever sequence of these portal-linked modifications, every player in The Grid can reach a predetermined target skill rating, perfectly matching their aspirational championship figures.\n\nAt the start of each round, the tournament record keeper receives precise details: the number of arenas, the number of portals, the current skill ratings of each player, and the desired target skills to be achieved after the series of modifications. Additionally, the connections between arenas via portals are meticulously listed, ensuring all participants and adjustments can be tracked. The challenge is clear: for each tournament configuration, determine whether it is possible to manipulate skill ratings via the prescribed operations so that every arena\u2019s player matches their exact target skill by the end.\n\nFor each provided tournament scenario, the keeper must respond with a simple word expressing the feasibility of the task: \"YES\" if there exists some sequence of portal-linked skill adjustments that achieve the targets exactly, and \"NO\" if it is impossible under the given network and the starting skill conditions. The number of tournaments to assess can be many\u2014up to a thousand\u2014and the total number of arenas and portals considered across all rounds is immense, sometimes reaching into the hundreds of thousands, making the coordinators\u2019 decisions incredibly complex and vital.\n\nConsider two examples from the ongoing season: in the first, four arenas are linked by four portals. Initial skill ratings stand at five, one, two, and minus three respectively, while their targets are three, three, ten, and one. By carefully applying skill adjustments\u2014such as augmenting the second and third players by two, then diminishing the first and fourth by two, and finally adding six to the third and fourth\u2014the coordinators successfully guide all players to their goals, winning a resounding \"YES.\" Conversely, in a second, similar setup, a different collection of initial and target skills defies all portal-based manipulations, yielding a firm \"NO.\"\n\nThus, the challenge of The Grid\u2019s coordinators is both a test of strategy and insight, balancing the intricacies of the portals\u2019 connections with the players\u2019 evolving skill ratings. Their ability to foresee whether the ideal final distribution of skills is attainable shapes the fate of every player in the exhilarating e-sports tournament.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou have a connected undirected graph made of n nodes and m edges. The i-th node has a value v_i and a target value t_i.\n\nIn an operation, you can choose an edge (i, j) and add k to both v_i and v_j, where k can be any integer. In particular, k can be negative.\n\nYour task to determine if it is possible that by doing some finite number of operations (possibly zero), you can achieve for every node i, v_i = t_i.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\leq t \\leq 1000), the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n, m (2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5, n-1\\leq m\\leq \\min(2\\cdot 10^5, \\frac{n(n-1)}{2})) \u2014 the number of nodes and edges respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers v_1\\ldots, v_n (-10^9 \\leq v_i \\leq 10^9) \u2014 initial values of nodes.\n\nThe third line contains n integers t_1\\ldots, t_n (-10^9 \\leq t_i \\leq 10^9) \u2014 target values of nodes.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integers i and j representing an edge between node i and node j (1 \\leq i, j \\leq n, i\\ne j).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the graph is connected and there is at most one edge between the same pair of nodes.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5 and the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, if it is possible for every node to reach its target after some number of operations, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nSample Input 1\n\n2\n4 4\n5 1 2 -3\n3 3 10 1\n1 2\n1 4\n3 2\n3 4\n4 4\n5 8 6 6\n-3 1 15 4\n1 2\n1 4\n3 2\n3 4\n\nSample Output 1\n\nYES\nNO\n\nNote\nHere is a visualization of the first test case (the orange values denote the initial values and the blue ones the desired values):\n\nOne possible order of operations to obtain the desired values for each node is the following:\n\n- Operation 1: Add 2 to nodes 2 and 3.\n- Operation 2: Add -2 to nodes 1 and 4.\n- Operation 3: Add 6 to nodes 3 and 4.\n\nNow we can see that in total we added -2 to node 1, 2 to node 2, 8 to node 3 and 4 to node 4 which brings each node exactly to it's desired value.\n\nFor the graph from the second test case it's impossible to get the target values.",

If so, it returns `True`.\n   - Otherwise, it recursively explores its neighbors.\n\n3. **Main Logic:**\n   - For each test case:\n     - Read the input values for `n`, `m`, `v`, `t`, and `edges`.\n     - Construct the graph using the `edges` list.\n     - Create a `visited` list to keep track of visited nodes during DFS.\n     - Iterate through each node and call `dfs` to check if it's possible to reach the target value for that node.\n     - If any node cannot reach its target, print \"NO\".\n     - If all nodes can reach their targets, print \"YES\".\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or would like me to elaborate on any part of the code!\n",

If not, it's impossible to achieve the target values because the total change needed is odd.\n\n5. **Connected Component Traversal:**\n   - Use a breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse the connected components of the graph.\n   - For each node, check if the sum of its difference with its connected neighbors is even. If not, it's impossible to balance the changes.\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Print \"YES\" if it's possible to achieve the target values, otherwise print \"NO\".\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\n",

The club was home to a special chalice known simply as the Sum of Remainders, coveted not by its shine but by the challenge it represented. This chalice was guarded by a ritual involving a carefully arranged group of unique numbers, each representing a character or interest of a student. These numbers were chosen such that no two students had the same passion\u2014each a distinct spark reflecting their identity.\n\nThe rules of the ritual were as follows: the group of students would line up in a sequence ordered by their passions, and the challenge was to understand the harmony within any growing segment of the line. For any early part of this lineup\u2014from the first student all the way up to any other student in the order\u2014the club had to calculate the total of all pairwise expressions of playful remainder exchanges. Specifically, each pair\u2019s interaction was measured by taking the first student\u2019s passion value and seeing what was left over when it was divided by the second student's passion, summing this remainder for every possible pair among them. The catch was that this had to be done not just once, but after adding each student in the sequence, creating a series of sums\u2014smaller groups leading to larger ones, each revealing the delicate balance as the assembly grew.\n\nTheir task this semester was to produce this series of totals as efficiently as possible for the entire line of students, which could be quite long\u2014sometimes reaching into hundreds of thousands, much like a vast classroom where every unique student passion had to be accounted for without repetition, and every remainder interaction fully recorded. The club had to accept input like this: first, the number of students standing in line, and then on the very next line, their distinct passions listed in the exact order of their formation. Their output would be a line of answers, where each number corresponded to the sum of all these playful remainders among the students from the start up to that point in the lineup.\n\nFor example, one memorable day saw four students lined up with passions 6, 2, 7, and 3. The results of their remainder dance began modestly\u2014no remainder among the first alone. Adding the second student, playful divisions revealed a small nonzero sum. By the third student joining, the sum grew into a lively 12, and with the fourth, the grand total blossomed to 22, painting a vivid picture of the group's growing harmony.\n\nOn another occasion with just three students standing with passions 3, 2, and 1, the series started with zero, then reached 3 when the duo formed, and finally climaxed at 5 with the trio complete. It was this precise order\u2014the input defining the sequence and the resulting sums reflecting the rhythmic interplay\u2014that the club cherished above all, turning a seemingly simple numerical sequence into a living story of friendship and discovery in Cedarwood High's cherished math tradition.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou have an array a consisting of n distinct positive integers, numbered from 1 to n.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\n**Survivor Log: Transmission from the Shattered Wasteland**\n\nIn the hushed echoes of a fallen civilization, the remnants of humanity cling to survival in scattered enclaves. Among the relics of old technology lies a peculiar challenge\u2014the ancient Codex of Shadows\u2014a mysterious sequence of sigils etched into stone, each representing a unique power, measured by their hidden energies. These energies abide by strict rules: each symbol carries a strength no greater than what the survivors call the \"Power Limit,\" a value shaped by an arcane factor, the number **K**, which governs all possible strength magnitudes within twice the magnitude of **K** to the power of two.\n\nThe survivor elders have gathered a collection of **N** such symbols, each distinct in their cryptic energy signature, and they face an enigmatic trial. They must select an intermediary power\u2014ranging from the humblest zero to the pinnacle dictated by their arcane limit\u2014and fuse it secretly with every symbol in their collection. This fusion, however, isn\u2019t done by mere addition but by the ancient \"Shadow Weave,\" a weaving method of opposing energies that reshapes each symbol\u2019s power in unexpected ways.\n\nOnce woven, the elders measure the closest difference in strength between any two transformed symbols. This minimal gap\u2014the \"Veil of Proximity\"\u2014reflects how tightly the symbols cluster under the chosen power\u2019s influence. The quest is to find, for every possible intermediary power, what this closest gap is after weaving. It\u2019s not enough to merely find these gaps; the survivors need all of them, from the very first potential power to the last\u2014covering the entire spectrum allowed by their Power Limit.\n\nThe input to this trial is given in two parts: on the first line, the elders state the size of their collection and the factor **K** that defines their Power Limit. On the second line, they declare each symbol's strength\u2014distinct, non-negative, and all fitting within the bounds set by **K**. The survivors\u2019 task is to output a grand list, spanning all these possible intermediary powers. Each entry in this list should reveal the smallest distance discovered after weaving that specific power, arranged from the lowest possible weaving power starting at zero, continuing sequentially up to the crest of their power\u2019s domain.\n\nFor example, consider a collection of three symbols when the Power Limit is shaped by the number three. When the survivors entwine their tokens with the power zero, the minimal difference in the woven energies falls at a certain measure\u2014a small chasm they record. Moving to the weaving power one, they find a narrower gap, almost as if the symbols draw closer under that shadow. Proceeding through the powers up to seven, they note how these minimal differences dance, sometimes swelling, sometimes shrinking, reflecting the subtle interplay of their ancient weaving method. In this case, the recorded sequence of minimal distances after applying all powers in order reads like a coded message: three, one, one, two, two, one, one, three.\n\nWith another collection of three but under a stronger arcane factor of four, the story unfolds with a richer pattern of proximity gaps. From echoes of two to sudden jumps as large as six, each weaving power reveals its own unique closeness measure, like shifting sand dunes responding to an unseen force.\n\nThus, the survivors face the challenge not simply to survive but to master the Codex of Shadows by charting these hidden bounds\u2014unlocking, for every intermediary power from the base to the pinnacle dictated by their ancient factor, the closest ties binding their sacred symbols in the dance of the post-apocalyptic world.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array a consisting of n distinct elements and an integer k.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nAs the night descended upon the grand hall of the Celestial Museum, the night guard opened his logbook to record his latest puzzling observation. Tonight, the gallery was arranged with a sequence of enchanted display alcoves, each housing a dazzling collection of artifacts. Each alcove allowed a certain number of glowing orbs to be picked\u2014ranging from just a single orb in some chambers, to a legion in others, sometimes reaching as many as a billion shining spheres. The sequence of these arcane alcoves stretched long\u2014potentially as many as two hundred thousand\u2014lining the halls like a river of light.\n\nThe museum\u2019s ancient laws dictated a fascinating challenge: for the night guards, every chosen pattern of orb collections from these alcoves must adhere to a strict protocol. From the first alcove to the last, one had to select a count of orbs at least one and at most equal to the maximum orb count the chamber contained that night. But no two adjacent alcoves were allowed to mirror each other in their chosen number of orbs\u2014the crowd admired symmetry, but this particular dance of light sought diversity in its neighboring choices. The guard\u2019s quest was to count all the possible patterns that complied fully with these restrictions, ensuring no two consecutive alcoves glowed with identical brilliance.\n\nThe challenge unfolded: given the list of each alcove\u2019s maximum orb count, the guard had to determine how many unique arrays of chosen orbs existed, each such array representing a feasible nightly arrangement. Since the array of possibilities could be enormous\u2014far beyond what a simple tally could hold\u2014the guard was instructed to record the final count not in raw numbers but in a special numerical realm, where only the remainder after dividing by 998,244,353 mattered. This mystical modulus was a safeguard against the explosion of astronomical totals, ensuring the count remained tangible within the museum\u2019s enchanted ledger.\n\nTo report this to the museum curator, the guard would write his answer clearly. First, he would note the total number of alcoves on the opening line of his report\u2014a single number. On the next line, he would list the maximum orb counts of each chamber, gently nudged apart by spaces. After computation, the museum\u2019s ancient algorithm rendered a single line as well\u2014the count of all valid glowing orb patterns under the enchanted rules, presented modulo the guarding number.\n\nConsider the case recorded some nights ago: three alcoves, each holding at most two orbs. The guard discovered only two enchanting sequences obeyed the rhythm, such as one orb followed by two, then one again, or vice versa; these patterns shimmered uniquely without repeating numbers side by side. In another instance, with two alcoves allowing two and three orbs respectively, the guard found four possible arrangements that danced perfectly under the law, each unique in how the orb counts changed from one to the next. Yet, in a quieter observation with three alcoves each limited to a solitary orb, no valid sequences remained\u2014the strict avoidance of repeating orb numbers barred all patterns from lighting the hall in harmony.\n\nThus, the guard closed his log, content that by understanding these patterns and rules, the museum would forever preserve its nightly elegance, counting all the myriad ways its luminous displays could enchant visitors without ever dulling the beauty of contrasting radiance.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the realm of Dream Architecture, architects weave delicate webs of connections between ethereal Nodes\u2014the essences of sleeping minds. These Nodes range in number but number no more than a couple hundred thousand in a city\u2019s dreamscape, while the threads that bind them\u2014the dreamy Edges\u2014can stretch up to five hundred thousand filial ties. Each Edge links exactly two distinct Nodes, binding them in a dance of shared dreams, never catching themselves looping back to the same dream essence.\n\nWithin this dreamworld, there exists a sacred form of architecture known as the Cactus Dominions. A Cactus Dominion is a network where each thread of connection is committed to at most one enchanting cycle of dreams\u2014a simple loop that doesn\u2019t double back or twist unnaturally. When every connected cluster of Nodes within a greater Dreamscape city embodies this cactus nature, the entire city is called a Desert of Dreams\u2014a place where whimsical but limited dreaming cycles coexist without chaos or repetition of connections entwined in multiple loops.\n\nThe Dream Architect\u2019s task now is to explore which contiguous segments of these binding threads\u2014chosen from a chronological list of edges\u2014can independently sustain a Desert of Dreams. On the first scroll of input, the architect reads two numbers: the total Nodes and total Edges woven through the dreamscape. Following that, each successive line describes a single Edge, revealing the pair of Nodes it delicately connects, in the exact order they were woven into existence. The quest is to enumerate how many pairs of starting and ending indices\u2014each pair defining a segment of edges\u2014when left as the only threads in the Dreamscape, form a Desert of Dreams. In essence, the architect\u2019s goal is to count every possible range of edges which, by themselves, maintain the city\u2019s cactus harmony throughout all clusters\u2014a challenge of both subtlety and scale given the multitude of dream connections.\n\nFor example, consider a city with five Nodes and six Edges described in the dream log. All edges together form cycles, but cleverly picking any continuous span from the first to the last Edge always preserves the Desert condition, resulting in twenty such peaceful dream segments. In another vision, two Nodes connected repeatedly by three identical Edges produce single-edge Deserts when chosen alone, alongside pairs that reveal brief two-Node cycles of length two, amounting to five possible peaceful segments. These examples illuminate the delicate balance between connectivity and cyclical harmony that marks a true Desert of Dreams.\n\nHence, the architect\u2019s output is but a single magical number\u2014an integer that counts all such pairs of indices\u2014defining allowable continuous stretches of Edges that keep the Dreamscape a serene Desert. Each input conjures this answer, revealing the dream logic through the numerical tapestry of cactus cycles and desert clusters, guiding architects across even the most expansive landscapes of imagination.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an undirected graph of N nodes and M edges, E_1, E_2, \\dots E_M.\n\nA connected graph is a cactus if each of it's edges belogs to at most one simple cycle. A graph is a desert if each of it's connected components is a cactus.\n\nFind the number of pairs (L, R), (1 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq M) such that, if we delete all the edges except for E_L, E_{L+1}, \\dots E_R, the graph is a desert.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers N and M (2 \\leq N \\leq 2.5 \\times 10^5, 1 \\leq M \\leq 5 \\times 10^5). Each of the next M lines contains two integers. The i-th line describes the i-th edge. It contains integers U_i and V_i, the nodes connected by the i-th edge (E_i=(U_i, V_i)). It is guaranteed that 1 \\leq U_i, V_i \\leq N and U_i \\neq V_i.\n\nOutput Format\nThe output contains one integer number - the answer.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5 6\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 1\n2 4\n\nSample Output 1\n\n20\n\nSample Input 2\n\n2 3\n1 2\n1 2\n1 2\n\nSample Output 2\n\n5\n\nNote\nIn the second example: Graphs for pairs (1, 1), (2, 2) and (3, 3) are deserts because they don't have any cycles. Graphs for pairs (1, 2) and (2, 3) have one cycle of length 2 so they are deserts.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the kingdom of Numeria, there exists a legendary board game called **Bitwise Realms**, revered among scholars and strategists alike. This game is played on a grand linear tapestry, segmented into tiles, each inscribed with a non-negative rune of power. The length of this tapestry, the grand number of tiles laid end to end, can stretch up to a million \u2014 a vast battlefield where many patterns can unfold. Each tile\u2019s rune is inscribed with an ancient number that could reach nearly a quintillion in magnitude, embodying immense strength.\n\nThe game\u2019s challenge is set around selecting consecutive stretches of tiles from this tapestry \u2014 from a starting tile to an ending one, forming what the old tomes call a \"segment\". Warriors who master Bitwise Realms must identify segments where the presence of power is balanced in a curious way: the faintest spark and the mightiest blaze on the segment must share a secret count. More precisely, when these numbers are translated into the sacred \u201cbit banners\u201d\u2014strings of on/off symbols\u2014the smallest and largest rune in the chosen segment must each display the same number of glowing emblems lit. This celestial rule dictates whether a segment is worthy of \"passing the check,\" granting points and honor.\n\nYour sacred task as the player is to discern, among all possible contiguous stretches from the grand tapestry, just how many such segments satisfy this shimmering balance. The segments must start no earlier than the first tile and no later than the last, moving sequentially without skipping any tile, and the count you seek is the total number of these segments that fulfill the mark of equal bit-light counts between their weakest and strongest runes.\n\nThe chronicles provide two captivating examples: in the first, the tapestry is composed of five tiles bearing runes stamped 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The master tally reveals that nine segments achieve the perfect balance of bit emblems. In the second saga, a tapestry of ten tiles carries runes including 0, 5, 7, 3, 9, 10, 1, 6, 13, and 7. Here, the wise reveal that eighteen segments pass the celestial counting trial. Each example sets the stage by first showing the mighty length of the tapestry on one line, followed on the next by the sequence of rune powers etched along each tile, just as you would prepare your board for play.\n\nAs you prepare to engage in the Bitwise Realms, remember: the count you seek echoes through the lattice of tiles, understanding the secret shared light count of the min and max runes in every conceivable segment, revealing the path from chaos to harmonious order across this vast numerical battlefield.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nWilliam has an array of non-negative numbers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n. He wants you to find out how many segments l \\le r pass the check. The check is performed in the following manner:\n\n1. The minimum and maximum numbers are found on the segment of the array starting at l and ending at r.\n2. The check is considered to be passed if the binary representation of the minimum and maximum numbers have the same number of bits equal to 1.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 10^6), the size of array a.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n (0 \\le a_i \\le 10^{18}), the contents of array a.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput a single number \u00a0\u2014 the total number of segments that passed the check.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nSample Output 1\n\n9\n\nSample Input 2\n\n10\n0 5 7 3 9 10 1 6 13 7\n\nSample Output 2\n\n18",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the vast digital ecosystem of the Simulation Console, a peculiar species called the Elementals roams within a linear habitat known as the Array Path. Each Elemental carries an energy value\u2014sometimes positive, sometimes negative\u2014shaping the vitality of their immediate surroundings. Alongside this, an environmental constant called the Threshold Spirit, represented by a mystic force named the Balance Quotient, hovers invisibly, influencing harmony for any segment of this path.\n\nThe world is governed by a sacred law: the Shimmering Selection. From the bustling array of Elementals, one must awaken or \"select\" as many beings as possible, infusing them with vibrant life. Yet, the Shimmering Selection imposes a crucial condition over every contiguous community they form, if that community comprises more than one Elemental. This law decrees that either *at least one member within that community remains asleep*\u2014unselected and shadowed\u2014or if every member within wakes together in vibrant unity, the collective energy of their union must reach or exceed the power invoked by the Balance Quotient multiplied by the community's size. This ensures that thriving groups uphold a minimal standard of vigor, preserving balance across the ecosystem.\n\nYour quest, then, is a grand challenge: for each of several habitats differing in length and composition, you must determine how many Elementals can be awakened without violating the Shimmering Selection. The Console will first reveal how many scenarios await your wisdom. For each realm, it discloses the number of Elementals lining its trail, their individual energy signatures in sequence, and finally the enigmatic Balance Quotient casting its influence. Your response must be a single number per realm\u2014a record of the maximal awakening possible while maintaining the sacred harmony of the Shimmering Selection.\n\nConsider the first realm, where five Elementals stand in a row, their energies shimmering as one, two, three, four, and five respectively, while the Balance Quotient lingers at two. You might awaken all but one, say the second Elemental rests quietly while the others pulse with life. Any group you peer into either includes a sleeper, or its combined energy surpasses twice the group's size, hence remaining harmonious. Attempting to awaken all five would backfire\u2014the earliest pairs fall short of the needed energy, breaching the sacred law. Thus, the tally stands at four awakened beings.\n\nIn another vast realm with ten Elementals bearing energies that dance between two and four alternatingly and a Balance Quotient of three, more generous awakenings are possible\u2014up to eight maintain the symphony. Other realms showcase their own patterns, with some negative energy trickling through, challenging the harmony yet still permitting a worthy number of awakenings. Each report you craft recounts the greatest collective vitality attainable under the Shimmering Selection, ensuring that every glow in this intricate ecosystem respects the balance binding it.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array of integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n and an integer x.\n\nYou need to select the maximum number of elements in the array, such that for every subsegment a_l, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_r containing strictly more than one element (l < r), either:\n\n- At least one element on this subsegment is not selected, or\n- a_l + a_{l+1} + \\ldots + a_r \\geq x \\cdot (r - l + 1).\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of input contains one integer t (1 \\leq t \\leq 10): the number of test cases.\n\nThe descriptions of t test cases follow, three lines per test case.\n\nIn the first line you are given one integer n (1 \\leq n \\leq 50\\,000): the number of integers in the array.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (-100\\,000 \\leq a_i \\leq 100\\,000).\n\nThe third line contains one integer x (-100\\,000 \\leq x \\leq 100\\,000).\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of elements that you can select.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n2\n10\n2 4 2 4 2 4 2 4 2 4\n3\n3\n-10 -5 -10\n-8\n3\n9 9 -3\n5\n\nSample Output 1\n\n4\n8\n2\n2\n\nNote\nIn the first example, one valid way to select the elements is [\\underline{1}, 2, \\underline{3}, \\underline{4}, \\underline{5}]. All subsegments satisfy at least one of the criteria. For example, for the subsegment l = 1, r = 2 we have that the element 2 is not selected, satisfying the first criterion. For the subsegment l = 3, r = 5 we have 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 \\ge 2 \\cdot 3, satisfying the second criterion.\n\nWe can't select all elements, because in this case for l = 1, r = 2 all elements are selected and we have a_1 + a_2 = 3 < 2 \\cdot 2. Thus, the maximum number of selected elements is 4.\n\nIn the second example, one valid solution is [\\underline{2}, \\underline{4}, 2, \\underline{4}, \\underline{2}, \\underline{4}, 2, \\underline{4}, \\underline{2}, \\underline{4}].\n\nIn the third example, one valid solution is [\\underline{-10}, -5, \\underline{-10}].\n\nIn the fourth example, one valid solution is [\\underline{9}, \\underline{9}, -3].",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the grand realm of the Festival Parade, a long queue of enchanted tokens, each glowing with a unique magical aura, awaited their time to join the procession. There were precisely as many tokens as eager parade spots lined in a row, stretching up to one hundred and fifty thousand in number\u2014an impressive crowd indeed. Each token bore a mysterious numerical essence, a hidden power, that shimmered brightly under the festival sun. The festival master held a special mystical limit\u2014an aura threshold no pair of tokens in a single group could surpass to keep harmony in the parade\u2019s energy.\n\nThe rules of the Festival Parade Queue Directive were strict yet fair. The tokens could be chosen to form subsets, but these subsets had to follow a peculiar bond: for any two tokens chosen, their combined magical clash\u2014measured by an arcane operation known as the \"light XOR\"\u2014could never produce a power greater than the sacred threshold set by the master. This meant every pair\u2019s flashing energy together had to be gentle enough to not exceed the master\u2019s limit. No subset could be empty; each group had its own lively merriment. Because the number of possible friendly groups could swell beyond measure, the results were to be recited by a common chant modulo a grand festival number, 998,244,353, to keep the rhythm steady for the record-keepers.\n\nYour task as a Festival Sage is to gaze upon the enchanted tokens\u2019 powers and the master's threshold, then count how many magical groups can parade together without causing a disruptive clash. The input that you receive first describes how many tokens gaze back at you and the mystical aura threshold the festival master decreed. On the very next line, you are granted the list of magic values etched onto the tokens, each revealing their unique contribution to the festival\u2019s lore. From this, you must determine gracefully how many non-empty groups can dance harmoniously under the sacred XOR light limit, and whisper your answer as a single grand number, voice lifted modulo the festival\u2019s special chant number.\n\nPicture, for example, a small parade of four tokens with powers zero, one, two, and three, under a gentle threshold of two. The festival rules allow exactly eight such groups that respect the harmony of their magical clashes. Another tale recounts a more modest parade of three tokens with powers four, two, and two, under a threshold of six, where seven harmonious groups come to life. Or consider four tokens wielding powers one, one, two, and two, under an unyielding zero threshold\u2014here, six peaceful groupings form the heart of the festival.\n\nSo arise, Festival Sage, and discern from the tokens\u2019 gleams and the strict aura threshold how to enumerate every possible gathering that sings in tune with the Festival Parade Queue Directive. This is not merely to find groups that survive the rule, but to count all such vibrant ensembles fully, ensuring the celebration proceeds with joyous unity and measured magic.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n and an integer x.\n\nFind the number of non-empty subsets of indices of this array 1 \\leq b_1 < b_2 < \\ldots < b_k \\leq n, such that for all pairs (i, j) where 1 \\leq i < j \\leq k, the inequality a_{b_i} \\oplus a_{b_j} \\leq x is held.

This represents the number of subsets with XOR sum `j - a[i-1]` using elements up to index `i-1`.\n\n3. **Modulo Operation:**\n   - We use the modulo operator `% 998244353` after each addition to prevent integer overflow and keep the result within the desired range.\n\n4. **Result:**\n   - Finally, `dp[n][x]` contains the total number of subsets with elements up to index `n` that have a maximum XOR sum of `x`, which is the desired output.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\n",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the labyrinthine corridors of the Space-Time Puzzle Labyrinth, the ancient Timekeepers guard a string of luminous orbs, each orb shining as either a dark shadow or a bright spark. This sequence stretches long, stretching as far as the eye can see, from a minimum of two orbs to a grand total no greater than five thousand in length. Among these orbs, a puzzle of profound importance is whispered: the capacity to select a contiguous cluster of these orbs that holds exactly a certain number of bright sparks, a number that can be zero or as many as the length of the sequence itself. Within this chosen cluster, the Timekeeper may alter the order of orbs freely, shuffling the shadows and sparks in any configuration to reshape the sequence\u2019s rhythm.\n\nThe rules of this realm make clear the limits of this mysterious power. Only one rearrangement operation can ever be performed on the entire orb sequence \u2014 no second chances, no repeated attempts. The operation must focus on a continuous band of orbs whose internal count of bright sparks matches precisely the chosen number, creating a window where transformation is allowed. This power reshapes the magnetic signature of the sequence, but never outside the boundaries set by the strict count of bright orbs in the selected band.\n\nYour quest is to discern how many unique sequences might emerge from this single fateful operation; how the layout of shadows and sparks can be twisted to craft entirely new signatures, or, if no rearrangement is performed, how the original sequence stands distinct among all possibilities. The key is to unveil the full spectrum of potential outcomes, counting each distinct sequence that can appear after one shuffle, or patience, when no shuffle is performed at all. The labyrinth demands the answer to be presented as a solitary number \u2014 the tally of all attainable sequences, delivered in a final form that wraps the count within a magical modulus, the number 998244353, ensuring the result remains bound within the cosmic constraints of the realm.\n\nThe input to unlock this puzzle is straightforward yet precise: first, you receive two integers on a single line, describing the length of the orb sequence and the exact number of bright sparks the chosen cluster must include. The next line reveals the very sequence itself \u2014 a long chain of shadows and sparks laid bare, composed only of these two states, dark orbs represented as \u20180\u2019 and bright orbs as \u20181\u2019. Your output, a single integer, will proclaim how many unique sequences arise from all possible single shuffles permitted by the puzzle\u2019s law.\n\nTo glimpse the puzzle\u2019s essence, imagine these examples from the crypt: A sequence of seven orbs with exactly two bright sparks chosen for rearrangement can yield sixteen unique outcomes, a variety of signatures glowing with different arrangements. When the chosen count is zero, meaning only dark shadows are shuffled, the sequence remains unchanged \u2014 thus, only one signature stands. For a single bright spark cluster, ten different patterns can appear, each a whisper of permutations. And when the chosen cluster almost saturates the sequence with eight bright sparks, only the original pattern survives unchanged. Such is the intricate dance of order and chaos inside the Space-Time Puzzle Labyrinth.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a binary string (i. e. a string consisting of characters 0 and/or 1) s of length n. You can perform the following operation with the string s at most once: choose a substring (a contiguous subsequence) of s having exactly k characters 1 in it, and shuffle it (reorder the characters in the substring as you wish).\n\nCalculate the number of different strings which can be obtained from s by performing this operation at most once.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (2 \\le n \\le 5000; 0 \\le k \\le n).\n\nThe second line contains the string s of length n, consisting of characters 0 and/or 1.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of different strings which can be obtained from s by performing the described operation at most once. Since the answer can be large, output it modulo 998244353.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n7 2\n1100110\n\nSample Output 1\n\n16\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5 0\n10010\n\nSample Output 2\n\n1\n\nSample Input 3\n\n8 1\n10001000\n\nSample Output 3\n\n10\n\nSample Input 4\n\n10 8\n0010011000\n\nSample Output 4\n\n1\n\nNote\nSome strings you can obtain in the first example:\n\n- to obtain 0110110, you can take the substring from the 1-st character to the 4-th character, which is 1100, and reorder its characters to get 0110;\n- to obtain 1111000, you can take the substring from the 3-rd character to the 7-th character, which is 00110, and reorder its characters to get 11000;\n- to obtain 1100101, you can take the substring from the 5-th character to the 7-th character, which is 110, and reorder its characters to get 101.\n\nIn the second example, k = 0 so you can only choose the substrings consisting only of 0 characters. Reordering them doesn't change the string at all, so the only string you can obtain is 10010.",

        "question_title": "A Random Code Problem",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the grand hall of the Kingdom of Numeria, a legendary board game called **\u201cExpected Valor\u201d** captivates scholars and strategists alike. The game begins with a sequence of magical stones arranged on the board\u2014each stone\u2019s power level a secret number, whispered from the ancient formulae. The initial stone\u2019s power is gifted directly from the kingdom\u2019s archives. The rest of the stones spring into existence by an alchemical ritual: each new stone\u2019s power is forged by multiplying the just-previous stone\u2019s power by a sacred multiplier, adding an enchanted constant, then extracting the remainder after removing all complete sets defined by the kingdom\u2019s grand modulus. There can be up to tens of millions of stones, and these parameters\u2014the starting power, the multiplier, the additive enchantment, and the modulus\u2014are all provided at the start of each round of the game. Among these, a special number governs the depth of the mystic calculations, no greater than seventeen.\n\nThe rules decree that players calculate a hidden treasure\u2019s value named **ans**, determined through complex incantations involving these stones\u2019 powers. The exact spell is intricate, but crucially it requires evaluating an \u201cexpected\u201d magnitude of the treasure once all stones complete their enchanted influence. Because the game thrives on probability layered with combinatorial magic, the treasure's expected worth, when multiplied by the total number of stones taken to the power of the mystical depth, forms a perfect whole number\u2014this forms the \u201ctrue value\u201d of the treasure. Yet, the kingdom\u2019s royal codex demands this value be expressed under a special numeric secrecy\u2014encoded in the realm\u2019s prime modulus of 998,244,353 to keep secrets safe from rival kingdoms.\n\nPlayers receive their challenge in a scroll: the very first line chronicles six sacred numbers\u2014the count of stones, the initial stone\u2019s power, the multiplier, the additive enchantment, the mystic depth, and the modulus that shields the realm\u2019s computations. From these, the entire sequence of stones is conjured by the formula embedded in the kingdom\u2019s arcane laws. The ultimate goal is to present the secret integer\u2014this treasure value fully scaled and cloaked in modular secrecy\u2014upon a single parchment line as the result of the ritual.\n\nTake, for example, a round where the kingdom provides three stones, beginning with power ten, a multiplier of three, an additive enchantment of five, a mystic depth of thirteen, and a modulus of eighty-eight. This summons stones of powers ten, thirty-five, and twenty-two in order. Following the sacred computations, players deduce the encoded treasure value to be 382,842,030. In another fateful session, only two stones rise, their powers born from far greater multipliers and enchantments, but the final treasure, after the ritual\u2019s complexities, encodes to 319,392,398.\n\nThus, scholars and players of \u201cExpected Valor\u201d strive beyond mere completion\u2014they seek the precise, mathematically perfect treasure value that the arcane sequence and deep powers unveil, honoring the kingdom\u2019s laws and lighting the path to victory in the enigmatic halls of Numeria.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an integer array a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n - 1}, and an integer k.

It can be shown that E \\cdot n^k is an integer. You have to output this integer modulo 998244353.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 10 3 5 13 88\n\nSample Output 1\n\n382842030\n\nSample Input 2\n\n2 15363 270880 34698 17 2357023\n\nSample Output 2\n\n319392398\n\nNote\nThe array in the first example test is [10, 35, 22].

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the far reaches of the galaxy, on the frontier colony of Nexara Prime, the Council of Starfarers governs a sprawling array of quantum energy nodes. Each node hums with a certain level of radiant power, a non-negative intensity coded into a luminous spectrum visible only to the keener eyes of the colony\u2019s engineers. These nodes are arranged linearly across a sprawling energy lattice, numbered from the station nearest the central hub to the one at the far edge, each radiating a unique energy signature. The colony\u2019s vitality depends not just on these individual energies but on the mysterious interplay between pairs of nodes, measured by the combined luminance formed under a signature interstellar fusion, a process known as the Starweave Combination\u2014a fusion that merges two nodes\u2019 energies into a vibrant new pattern, where the intensity of the light is governed by the \u201cStarweave\u201d rule that overlays two spectra to reveal their highest combined brightness without losses.\n\nAmong the colony\u2019s key challenges lies a critical strategy for assessing vitality. For any contiguous segment of the lattice\u2014defined by picking a start node and an end node farther along the sequence\u2014the Council desires to identify the \u201cLeast Starweave Cost\u201d: the faintest combined luminance achieved by applying the Starweave Combination on any *pair* of distinct nodes within that segment. Since the Starweave Combination always brings together two nodes\u2019 brightness patterns without diminishing their intensities, the least combined intensity among the pairs reveals structural weak links within the energy net. Moreover, the colony faces many such inquiries, issued as directives specifying which segments of nodes to probe, and the Council demands answers that are both swift and precise to maintain the delicate energy balance supporting life on Nexara Prime.\n\nYour task, as the colony\u2019s lead Starweave Analyst, is to craft a system capable of processing multiple investigations at once. Each inquiry describes a segment of the energy lattice by naming two nodes\u2014a start and an end\u2014that affirm the segment\u2019s linear boundaries. For each inquiry, you must return the smallest possible Starweave Combination value arising from every pair of distinct nodes inside that segment. Keep in mind that the colony may face up to ten thousand such cases, with each lattice extending to a hundred thousand nodes at most, and the total number of inquiries will remain so manageable that their sum does not outpace the limits of the colony\u2019s computational fabric. The radiant intensities themselves are strictly bounded, never exceeding the threshold corresponding to a thirty-layer luminous spectrum\u2014a level of brightness carefully stored within thirty binary light layers, ensuring manageable data transmission across stellar networks.\n\nInput for these investigations comes in structured bundles: first, the number of distinct lattice scenarios to analyze. Each scenario describes the number of nodes in its lattice on one line, then the entire sequence of radiant intensities for that lattice on the next line\u2014a list of radiant signatures, each expressed as a number reflecting the layered brightness. Afterward, the number of investigations to carry out for that lattice appears, followed by a line for each inquiry; these specify the starting node and the ending node of the segment to analyze. Your output for each scenario must be the smallest Starweave Combination value for each inquiry\u2019s segment, printed in order, one per line, as subliminal codes streaming back from the processing archives.\n\nConsider a colony report with two lattice scenarios. The first describes five nodes with radiant levels: six, one, three, two, and one. Four inquiries follow, focusing on segments starting with the first and second nodes respectively, and leading to nodes as far as the fifth. The minimal Starweave Combination in the first segment (nodes one to two) beams a value equivalent to seven, arising from intensities six and one interwoven. Similarly, the other queries bring results that reflect the faintest amalgamations in their specified segments: three, three, and one, capturing the subtlest Starkweave patterns. The second scenario, with four nodes characterized by brightness zero, two, one, and an extraordinary maximum near the luminance ceiling, includes four inquiries, with Starweave Combination results that range from two on the first segment through remarkable intensities reaching just above a billion, echoing the zenith of radiant potential held within the lattice.\n\nThrough mastering this spectral analysis of node arrays, the Nexara Prime engineers safeguard the heart of their colony\u2014ensuring that every segment pulsates with strength, weaknesses are uncovered with clarity, and the Starweave remains a trustworthy ally in their ceaseless journey among the stars.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array a of n non-negative integers, numbered from 1 to n.\n\nLet's define the cost of the array a as \\displaystyle \\min_{i \\neq j} a_i | a_j, where | denotes the bitwise OR operation.\n\nThere are q queries. For each query you are given two integers l and r (l < r). For each query you should find the cost of the subarray a_{l}, a_{l + 1}, \\ldots, a_{r}.\n\nInput Format\nEach test case consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n (2 \\le n \\le 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the length array a.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (0 \\le a_i < 2^{30})\u00a0\u2014 the elements of a.\n\nThe third line of each test case contains an integer q (1 \\le q \\le 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries.\n\nEach of the next q lines contains two integers l_j, r_j (1 \\le l_j < r_j \\le n)\u00a0\u2014 the description of the j-th query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 10^5.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case print q numbers, where the j-th number is the cost of array a_{l_j}, a_{l_j + 1}, \\ldots, a_{r_j}.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n2\n5\n6 1 3 2 1\n4\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n2 5\n4\n0 2 1 1073741823\n4\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n3 4\n\nSample Output 1\n\n7\n3\n3\n1\n2\n3\n1\n1073741823\n\nNote\nIn the first test case the array a is\n\n110_2, 001_2, 011_2, 010_2, 001_2.\n\nThat's why the answers for the queries are:\n\n- [1; 2]: a_1 | a_2 = 110_2 | 001_2 = 111_2 = 7;\n- [2; 3]: a_2 | a_3 = 001_2 | 011_2 = 011_2 = 3;\n- [2; 4]: a_2 | a_3 = a_3 | a_4 = a_2 | a_4 = 011_2 = 3;\n- [2; 5]: a_2 | a_5 = 001_2 = 1.\n\nIn the second test case the array a is\n\n00_2, 10_2, 01_2, \\underbrace{11\\ldots 1_2}_{30} (a_4 = 2^{30} - 1).\n\nThat's why the answers for the queries are:\n\n- [1; 2]: a_1 | a_2 = 10_2 = 2;\n- [2; 3]: a_2 | a_3 = 11_2 = 3;\n- [1; 3]: a_1 | a_3 = 01_2 = 1;\n- [3; 4]: a_3 | a_4 = 01_2 | \\underbrace{11\\ldots 1_2}_{30} = 2^{30} - 1 = 1073741823.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the vast Collaborative Task Scheduling Center, where countless agents coordinate intricate assignments, there is a revered challenge to understand how sequences of tasks interplay under strict social rhythms. Each sequence represents a unique plan, where the order in which tasks are performed deeply matters. The Center's scholars study sequences of a fixed length, calling this length **N**, which can be as large as the grand total of the Center\u2019s agents (around 998 million). However, amidst such vastness, only a very small number of critical disturbances \u2014 call them tension points and priority flips \u2014 govern the internal harmony of these sequences.\n\nThe rules of the Center\u2019s society dictate two essential measures for any plan: first, the number of **tension pairs** \u2014 these are pairs of tasks where a task earlier stands above a task later in rank, causing friction between the agents. This tension count, **K**, is always very modest, no more than eleven, representing those rare moments when priority conflicts strain the schedule. Second, the number of **priority flips** \u2014 moments where a task suddenly breaks the smooth declining priority from one step to the next \u2014 must be counted. This count, called **X**, also never surpasses eleven, reflecting the number of times agents must sharply adjust their priorities as they move through the plan.\n\nThe Central goal is daunting yet elegant: given a multitude of scenarios, each specifying the exact length of the plan, the precise number of tension pairs to occur, and the specific count of priority flips allowed, the scholars seek to discover how many unique sequences of tasks conform perfectly to these constraints. Each sequence is a permutation, meaning it is a strict rearrangement of tasks numbered one through **N**, with no duplicates. The aim is to find, for each scenario, just how many such sequences exist \u2014 accounting for the enormous scale of plans but the tiny limits on conflicts. To maintain clarity and common understanding, results must be presented modulo a sacred number, 998,244,353, ensuring all answers remain manageable while preserving the ancient mathematical harmony cherished by the scheduling center.\n\nInput follows a formal structure: first, a single number indicating how many scenarios await exploration \u2014 no fewer than one and no more than thirty thousand tales. Each following line describes a single scenario with three numbers: the length of the plan, the exact count of tension pairs needed, and the precise number of priority flips demanded. Each trio communicates a distinct world-building challenge, inviting the scholars to unravel the mysteries of these constrained sequences. The output, correspondingly, consists of one line per scenario, each revealing the count of all sequences fitting the described tension and priority narrative, measured within the boundaries of the modular number.\n\nTo illuminate, consider the Center\u2019s records such as these: a plan length of ten tasks with six tensions and four priority flips yields exactly 465 valid sequences. Another scenario, seven tasks with three tensions and one priority flip, yields a modest twelve sequences. As plans stretch into the hundreds of thousands with maximal allowed tension and flips, the counts bloom into vast numbers like 986,128,624, all modulo that special number. These results serve as the map for the Center\u2019s scholars, guiding their understanding of how intricate task orders resonate under strict social logic, blending size, tension, and sudden priority changes into harmonious permutations.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nCalculate the number of permutations p of size n with exactly k inversions (pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and p_i > p_j) and exactly x indices i such that p_i > p_{i+1}.\n\nYep, that's the whole problem. Good luck!\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \\le t \\le 3 \\cdot 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of one line which contains three integers n, k and x (1 \\le n \\le 998244352; 1 \\le k \\le 11; 1 \\le x \\le 11).\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the answer to the problem, taken modulo 998244353.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n10 6 4\n7 3 1\n163316 11 7\n136373 11 1\n325902 11 11\n\nSample Output 1\n\n465\n12\n986128624\n7636394\n57118194",

        "question_title": "Tokitsukaze and Beautiful Subsegments",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the bustling heart of a tranquil town, there was a renowned tea house known far and wide for its intricate rituals surrounding tea ceremonies. This tea house was governed by Tokitsukaze, a meticulous operations manager who prided herself on the harmony and balance within her establishment. In the tea house's secret chamber, there was a sacred scroll containing a lineup of tea cups arranged in a particular order\u2014each cup bore a unique number from one to a grand total, representing the varying richness of the tea leaves it contained. This line of cups was never shuffled arbitrarily; it was a unique sequence where each cup's richness never repeated, crafting a perfect harmony of flavors.\n\nTokitsukaze devised a special way to judge the beauty within subsets of tea cups. She called a contiguous array of cups \"beautiful\" if within that selection, there existed a pair of cups whose combined richness, when multiplied, equaled exactly the richness of the single richest cup in that segment. To clarify, suppose one only saw the cups between certain positions\u2014there must be two distinct cups inside this stretch, such that when their richness values joined in multiplication, the result matched the richest cup's value in that very segment. These \u201cbeautiful\u201d stretches were prized as perfect reflections of balance and complement within the tea house's philosophy.\n\nEvery day, Tokitsukaze was challenged with multiple guest requests. Each guest pointed to a certain section of cups within the sacred lineup and asked, \"How many beautiful sub-stretches\u2014formed by contiguous cups inside this section\u2014exist here?\" The task was to count, with precision and efficiency, all possible selections fully contained within the chosen portion of the tea cup line, which satisfied the special beauty condition of the pairwise multiplication equaling the max richness. The length of the tea cup lineup could reach hundreds of thousands, and the number of such guest queries could swell into millions, demanding not only accuracy but swift and elegant solutions in how to count these segments.\n\nOn the first scroll, Tokitsukaze would read two grand numbers: the total number of tea cups lining the table, and the quantity of inquiries she must answer this day. On the next scroll, she receives the exact sequence of cups, each with its unique richness values arranged in the mysterious order. Following that, each new scroll comes with two numbers, indicating the start and end positions of the stretch the guest is curious about. For each guest\u2019s request, Tokitsukaze must reveal the count of all such \u201cbeautiful\u201d contiguous sub-stretches lying completely within the range pointed out\u2014no less, no more.\n\nFor instance, when the tea cup lineup was composed of eight cups with richness values stretching like tendrils of flavor\u20141, 3, 5, 2, 4, 7, 6, 8\u2014one guest's query covering cups one to three found exactly two beautiful sub-stretches, those being the stretches covering the first two cups and the first three cups. Another guest, more minimal, asked for the stretch of just the very first cup and found no beautiful breath within such a tiny space. Yet, when another guest cast their eyes over the entire range of eight cups, Tokitsukaze gracefully revealed ten such beautiful segments, showcasing the tea house\u2019s abundance of harmonious blends.\n\nIn another occasion, with ten cups arranged as 6, 1, 3, 2, 5, 8, 4, 10, 7, 9, many guests queried all kinds of segments near and far, from the very first cup to overlapping mixtures\u2014each time Tokitsukaze danced through calculations and unveiled answers like 17 or 25 or fractures of smaller counts. Some stretches held no beauty to share, allowing the silence of contemplation amid the intricate flavors to settle. Thus, through the delicate balance of numbers and the mystic multiplication of their values, Tokitsukaze maintained the rhythms of the tea house, answering every inquiry with both wisdom and efficiency, preserving the art of balance and harmony in every cup lined upon her sacred table.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nTokitsukaze has a permutation p of length n.\n\nLet's call a segment [l,r] beautiful if there exist i and j satisfying p_i \\cdot p_j = \\max\\{p_l, p_{l+1}, \\ldots, p_r \\}, where l \\leq i < j \\leq r.\n\nNow Tokitsukaze has q queries, in the i-th query she wants to know how many beautiful subsegments [x,y] there are in the segment [l_i,r_i] (i.\u00a0e. l_i \\leq x \\leq y \\leq r_i).\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (1\\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5; 1 \\leq q \\leq 10^6)\u00a0\u2014 the length of permutation p and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n (1 \\leq p_i \\leq n)\u00a0\u2014 the permutation p.\n\nEach of the next q lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n)\u00a0\u2014 the segment [l_i,r_i] of this query.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each query, print one integer\u00a0\u2014 the numbers of beautiful subsegments in the segment [l_i,r_i].\n\nSample Input 1\n\n8 3\n1 3 5 2 4 7 6 8\n1 3\n1 1\n1 8\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n0\n10\n\nSample Input 2\n\n10 10\n6 1 3 2 5 8 4 10 7 9\n1 8\n1 10\n1 2\n1 4\n2 4\n5 8\n4 10\n4 7\n8 10\n5 9\n\nSample Output 2\n\n17\n25\n1\n5\n2\n0\n4\n1\n0\n0\n\nNote\nIn the first example, for the first query, there are 2 beautiful subsegments\u00a0\u2014 [1,2] and [1,3].",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the faded heart of a forgotten realm lies an ancient amusement park\u2014once vibrant with laughter and wonders, now silent and overgrown. This park is designed like a grand branching tree, where each junction is a pavilion, and the winding paths between them are bridges inscribed with mysterious numbers. The park\u2019s guardians, long vanished, left behind a massive blueprint: a map of pavilions counted in the hundreds of thousands, each connected by bridges holding secret integers\u2014a code etched in time.\n\nThese bridges hold significance beyond their stone and wood. When a visitor travels from one pavilion to another following the unique, winding path of the park, they pass over a sequence of bridges. Each number on a bridge tells a story, but some numbers echo more than once along this route. The true magic, however, emerges from those numbers whispered exactly once on that journey. In the old lore, the essence of the park\u2019s enchantment is said to be the sum of all such unique whispers, measured over every possible pair of pavilions where the starting pavilion\u2019s number is always less than the destination\u2019s.\n\nThe challenge of the blueprint\u2019s riddle is immense: imagine a sprawling network of countless pavilions interlinked so uniquely that there\u2019s exactly one way to walk from any pavilion to another without looping back. Your task is to find, for every possible orderly pair of pavilions, how many numbers appear just once along the path connecting them, then gather all these counts into one grand total. Every bridge\u2019s number lies somewhere between the smallest and largest pavilion numbers, and the number of pavilions can be so vast that even the mere notion of counting paths challenges the limits of time and patience.\n\nTo aid you, the blueprint provides instructions written as follows: on the very first line, it states the total number of pavilions\u2014a number not smaller than two and not larger than half a million. Then, on each subsequent line, it describes a single bridge, naming the two pavilions it connects and the secret number inscribed upon it. Indeed, the assignments ensure that the collection of bridges forms a perfect tree\u2014no cycles, no confusion\u2014only one unique path between any two pavilions. Your final quest is to reveal the ultimate sum of all those uniquely appearing bridge numbers over every possible pair of pavilions where the first pavilion\u2019s number is strictly less than the second.\n\nConsider a small spectral echo: three pavilions connected by two bridges, one bridge marked with the number one, the other with two. Walking from pavilion one to pavilion two uncovers one unique whisper; from pavilion one to pavilion three, another unique whisper; and between pavilion two and three, both unique whispers arise on the path. Gathering these reveals a total enchantment value of four. Or imagine two bridges both marked with the number two connecting three pavilions\u2014then only two unique whispers remain when you measure over all pairs. The grand sum, thus, shifts with the park\u2019s structure.\n\nFrom the blueprint\u2019s most intricate corners to its simplest edges, each test whispers its own story:\n\n- With three pavilions and bridges bearing numbers one and two, the final magic count is four.\n- With three pavilions but both bridges echoing the number two, the magic dims to two.\n- A five-pavilion layout, with bridges marked four, three, four, and five, reveals an enchantment summing to fourteen.\n- Two pavilions linked by a single bridge marked one reveal a humble magic of one.\n- A sprawling ten-pavilion maze with bridges brandishing numbers like three, eight, nine, five, seven, and more, conjures an immense magic sum of one hundred twenty.\n\nThus, the ancient pontiffs challenge anyone who dares to unravel the abandoned theme park: compute the sum of all unique whispers along every path connecting two pavilions in ascending order. Only then can the silent park truly speak again.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a tree, consisting of n vertices.

        "question_title": "Points",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the shadowed underbelly of the city, a secret society of masterminds plotted the most intricate heists ever conceived. Their meetings took place along a single, invisible linear pathway, known only as the Coordinate Line\u2014a place where every safe house, getaway point, and rendezvous mark a unique position, numbered discreetly but strictly in ascending order along the path. The society revered a particular pattern of arrangements for planning their triple acts, something they called the \"beautiful triple.\" This precious configuration involved three distinct points along the line, arranged so that the first point stood strictly behind the second, which in turn stood strictly behind the third\u2014each farther along the line than the last. Yet, they held a sacred boundary: the trail from the very first point to the last could never stretch beyond a certain distance, a maximum bound set by a mystical parameter known as the Decisive Gap, a number as high as two hundred thousand or more, ensuring their operations remained perfectly tight and coordinated.\n\nBefore each cryptic assembly, the society starts with an empty roster of points\u2014no safe houses or paths yet claimed. Then, a sequence of coded commands arrives, each one commanding either the addition of a new strategic point to their set or the removal of an already claimed point, toggling its presence in the network. This series can be quite lengthy, up to two hundred thousand commands, each referring to a specific position along the pathway, whose identity ranges within a similar grand scale. After each command, the society anxiously counts how many distinct beautiful triples\u2014those three-point formations that satisfy the strict ordering and fit snugly within the Decisive Gap\u2014they can currently discern in their roster. This count reflects how well their plan consolidates their points into tight, effective triple arrangements.\n\nThe challenge for the society\u2019s strategist, then, is clear: with each command that shifts the balance\u2014either marks a point as active if previously absent, or withdraws it if present\u2014they must promptly recount the total number of beautiful triples evident amidst the current set. The key is not just to note any valid triple but to discover and tally all such triples, encompassing every possible combination that respects the strict ordering and the maximum collective stretch from first to last point. Their goal is to best exploit every opportunity to optimize the formation of these triples as they evolve, managing their network so their heist plans are always at peak elegance and readiness, adapting swiftly to the ongoing changes.\n\nFor example, if the society receives a grand total of seven commands and sets their Decisive Gap at five units, the input records each command\u2019s target point along the line in a sequential set of values. Beginning with points introduced at positions eight, five, and three, they see how many beautiful triples can emerge after each insertion. As positions two, one, five (which was toggled off or on again), and six cycle through the set, the tally of beautiful triples rises, falls, and climbs again in response, reflecting the delicate dance of inclusion and removal. The outputs after each command reveal these shifting counts\u2014starting at zero, climbing, ebbing, and peaking as the complex network of points that form the foundation of their strategy transitions dynamically.\n\nThus, the society's entire heist planning hinges on keen, instant insight into the number of these beautiful triples after each command. Each line of their secret manual first states how many commands arrive and the value of the Decisive Gap. On the following line, each command position is enumerated. After every strategic toggle of presence, the manual demands the current tally of beautiful triples be reported precisely, on its own dedicated line, allowing the masterminds to measure their operational connectivity instantly and adapt accordingly.\n\nUltimately, through this delicate balancing of point toggling and triple counting, the society ensures their plans remain flawless, exploiting every tactical opportunity to weave three-point traps within the strict spatial confines of the city\u2019s shadows\u2014for it is only through maintaining the perfect balance of tight-knit triples that their heists achieve legendary perfection.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nA triple of points i, j and k on a coordinate line is called beautiful if i < j < k and k - i \\le d.\n\nYou are given a set of points on a coordinate line, initially empty. You have to process queries of three types:\n\n- add a point;\n- remove a point;\n- calculate the number of beautiful triples consisting of points belonging to the set.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers q and d (1 \\le q, d \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries and the parameter for defining if a triple is beautiful, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains q integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_q (1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5) denoting the queries. The integer a_i denotes the i-th query in the following way:\n\n- if the point a_i belongs to the set, remove it; otherwise, add it;\n- after adding or removing the point, print the number of beautiful triples.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each query, print one integer \u2014 the number of beautiful triples after processing the respective query.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n7 5\n8 5 3 2 1 5 6\n\nSample Output 1\n\n0\n0\n1\n2\n5\n1\n5",

        "question_title": "DFS Trees",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn a distant corner of the galaxy, a sprawling colony called Graphon was established, anchored by a network of interconnected spaceports. These spaceports, known simply as nodes, were linked by hyperlanes\u2014pathways that carried starships between hubs. Each hyperlane bore a unique prestige number, reflecting its importance in the colony\u2019s vast transportation web. From the earliest-built lane to the newest, the prestige climbed steadily without repeats, ensuring every path was distinct in rank. The colony\u2019s leaders took great pride in maintaining a fully connected cluster, where every starport could reach any other through some chain of hyperlanes.\n\nTo manage travel efficiency, the Graphon Council devised a special ritual: to select a \u201cSupreme Connecting Network\u201d that used a subset of hyperlanes combining the lowest total prestige while still ensuring every node was reachable. This network was known as the Minimum Prestige Web, a sacred structure representing balance and economy. Yet, a curious custom arose. For each starport, the council launched a \u201cFind Network\u201d quest, starting their linking ritual from that particular node. Each quest yielded a full weaving of hyperlanes\u2014always spanning the entire cluster, but not always with the minimal total prestige. The council wished to discern which starting points truly led to the most efficient networks, those embodying the least cumulative prestige.\n\nThe elders tasked the strategists with a grand mission: given the number of starports and hyperlanes, along with the pairs of starports connected by each uniquely ranked hyperlane, determine for each starport\u2019s \u201cFind Network\u201d quest whether that quest returns a Supreme Connecting Network or not. The strategists must output a line of signals, each either a proud \u201c1\u201d if the starting starport\u2019s weaving is truly minimal in prestige or a humble \u201c0\u201d otherwise. The colony\u2019s laws dictate that the number of starports will never fall below two and could soar up to one hundred thousand, with the hyperlanes numbering at least one less than the starports but never more than two hundred thousand. Between any pair of starports, only one hyperlane exists, keeping the system streamlined and clear. The grand challenge is to analyze all quests\u2014from the first starport\u2019s to the last starport\u2019s\u2014and compile their truthfulness into this binary report.\n\nThus, when a message arrives describing the colony\u2019s layout\u2014for instance, first revealing the number of starports and hyperlanes on a single line, then listing each hyperlane\u2019s linked starports in the order of their prestige\u2014the strategists set to work. Their final broadcast back to the colony is the verdict: a succession of zeroes and ones aligned with each starport\u2019s quest number, telling the tale of which starting points yield the Supreme Connecting Network\u2019s grace and which wander into costlier paths.\n\nConsider the tale from a small cluster of five starports and five hyperlanes, connected as these pairs: the first linking starport one and two, the second linking three and five, the third linking one and three, the fourth linking three and two, and the fifth linking four and two. Among the questings, only those that start from starports two, three, four, and five produce the Supreme Connecting Network, symbolized by the pattern 01111. In a grander constellation of ten starports and eleven hyperlanes, a more intricate pattern emerges\u2014a line reading 0011111011\u2014reflecting which origins embrace the most efficient dance of connections. Through these cosmic riddles, the colony\u2019s network flourishes, balanced on the artistry of prestige and the wisdom of starting points.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a connected undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges. The weight of the i-th edge is i.\n\nHere is a wrong algorithm of finding a minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph:\n\nEach of the calls findMST(1), findMST(2), ..., findMST(n) gives you a spanning tree of the graph. Determine which of these trees are minimum spanning trees.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n, m (2\\le n\\le 10^5, n-1\\le m\\le 2\\cdot 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph.\n\nEach of the following m lines contains two integers u_i and v_i (1\\le u_i, v_i\\le n, u_i\\ne v_i), describing an undirected edge (u_i,v_i) in the graph. The i-th edge in the input has weight i.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the graph is connected and there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.\n\nOutput Format\nYou need to output a binary string s, where s_i=1 if findMST(i) creates an MST, and s_i = 0 otherwise.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5 5\n1 2\n3 5\n1 3\n3 2\n4 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\n01111\n\nSample Input 2\n\n10 11\n1 2\n2 5\n3 4\n4 2\n8 1\n4 5\n10 5\n9 5\n8 2\n5 7\n4 6\n\nSample Output 2\n\n0011111011\n\nNote\nHere is the graph given in the first example.\n\nThere is only one minimum spanning tree in this graph. A minimum spanning tree is (1,2),(3,5),(1,3),(2,4) which has weight 1+2+3+5=11.\n\nHere is a part of the process of calling findMST(1):\n\n- reset the array vis and the edge set s;\n- calling dfs(1);\n- vis[1] := true;\n- iterate through each edge (1,2),(1,3);\n- add edge (1,2) into the edge set s, calling dfs(2): vis[2] := true iterate through each edge (2,1),(2,3),(2,4); because vis[1] = true, ignore the edge (2,1); add edge (2,3) into the edge set s, calling dfs(3): ...\n\nIn the end, it will select edges (1,2),(2,3),(3,5),(2,4) with total weight 1+4+2+5=12>11, so findMST(1) does not find a minimum spanning tree.\n\nIt can be shown that the other trees are all MSTs, so the answer is 01111.",

These sequences form the backbone of reality\u2019s fabric, their arrangements echoing through the quantum rhythms of this dimension. Each sequence is scrutinized by the Council of Symphony, guardians who ensure the consistency and harmony of cosmic arrangements.\n\nThe Council defines a special class of these sequences, called \"almost perfect alignments.\" To qualify as such, every element within a given arrangement must share a unique relationship with its inverse placement \u2014 a counterpart revealing where the entity itself is positioned when roles are switched. In essence, if you consider where an element stands, and then where its position points back in the inverted sequence, the difference between these two ranks must never stretch beyond the nearest neighbor \u2014 it must always be zero or one step away. This delicate balance preserves harmony and prevents chaotic disparities in the cosmic pattern. In practical terms, it means that for each element, when you compare its current spot with the spot it would take in an inverted mirror of the sequence, they can never be apart by more than one rank.\n\nThe task bestowed upon you, the Synchronizer, is to determine how many such almost perfect alignments exist given a sequence length N, for many trials across the multiverse. You will receive a list of cases, where each case narrates how grand the arrangement is. For every case, you must return the count of all sequences whose elemental positions remain tightly bound to their inverses, respecting the near adjacency rule. Crucially, since the universe\u2019s tally might be astronomically large, your answer must be adjusted by a universal modulus of 998244353, to ensure it fits within the cosmic ledger.\n\nThe input relayed to you arrives in two parts: first, a single integer T describing how many trials or distinct sequence lengths you are to analyze, ranging up to one thousand; then exactly T lines follow, each containing the integer N representing the length of the sequence under consideration. The combined sum of all these N values will never exceed 300,000, ensuring your computations remain tethered to feasible bounds. Your output must present, for each N, a solitary number on a line by itself \u2014 the count of almost perfect alignments modulo the sacred modulus.\n\nTo illustrate, when the universe tests an arrangement with only two members, both orderings are harmonious, yielding a count of two. For three, out of six possible orderings, four abide by the closeness principle. Magnifying the challenge to fifty members yields a cosmic count of 830,690,567 almost perfect sequences, a testament to the complex yet elegant tapestry woven by near-inverse proximity.\n\nThus, the Council awaits your insights, ready to witness the unveiling of these intricate almost perfect alignments, ensuring their place in the universe\u2019s eternal rhythm.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nA permutation p of length n is called almost perfect if for all integer 1 \\leq i \\leq n, it holds that \\lvert p_i - p^{-1}_i \\rvert \\le 1, where p^{-1} is the inverse permutation of p (i.e. p^{-1}_{k_1} = k_2 if and only if p_{k_2} = k_1).\n\nCount the number of almost perfect permutations of length n modulo 998244353.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\leq t \\leq 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\leq n \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^5) \u2014 the length of the permutation.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \\cdot 10^5.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the number of almost perfect permutations of length n modulo 998244353.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n2\n3\n50\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n4\n830690567\n\nNote\nFor n = 2, both permutations [1, 2], and [2, 1] are almost perfect.\n\nFor n = 3, there are only 6 permutations. Having a look at all of them gives us:\n\n- [1, 2, 3] is an almost perfect permutation.\n- [1, 3, 2] is an almost perfect permutation.\n- [2, 1, 3] is an almost perfect permutation.\n- [2, 3, 1] is NOT an almost perfect permutation (\\lvert p_2 - p^{-1}_2 \\rvert = \\lvert 3 - 1 \\rvert = 2).\n- [3, 1, 2] is NOT an almost perfect permutation (\\lvert p_2 - p^{-1}_2 \\rvert = \\lvert 1 - 3 \\rvert = 2).\n- [3, 2, 1] is an almost perfect permutation.\n\nSo we get 4 almost perfect permutations.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the vast digital realm of SocialNetia, two influencers stand at the center of a fascinating puzzle. These influencers each boast a unique sequence of signature hashtags\u2014a string of characters that define their online personas. Both personalities have an identical number of hashtags in their current profiles, arranged in a precise order. The lengths of these signature sequences vary from case to case but remain within the bounds befitting the platform\u2019s limits, never growing beyond a powerful figure stretching into the hundreds of thousands.\n\nIn SocialNetia, there exists a peculiar ritual to gain harmony between influencer brands: the Prefix-Suffix Exchange. This tradition allows influencers to select a group of hashtags at the beginning of one\u2019s signature sequence and swap it simultaneously with an identical-sized group taken from the end of the other\u2019s sequence. This operation can be done multiple times, if desired, or not at all. Each swap reshapes the personal signature sequences profoundly, allowing the two influencers to inch closer\u2014or drift further\u2014into synchronized online identity. The twist is that the size of the group they swap can range anywhere from a single hashtag to the entire signature. There are no hidden limits on how many times this exchange may occur; it depends solely on the influencers\u2019 strategic finesse.\n\nThe challenge has emerged to determine whether two given influencers can, by applying a series of these Prefix-Suffix Exchanges, align their signature hashtags perfectly. The goal is not merely to see if it might happen but to find out if it is within the realm of possibility to achieve complete equivalence in their profiles, creating a perfect match in hashtag order and content. This inquiry applies across many pairs, ranging up to ten thousand such influencer duets, each with distinct signature lengths that, combined, will never exceed a total complexity measured as two hundred thousand hashtags overall.\n\nAs a formal procedure: on the digital panel appears the number of influencer pairs to check. For each pair, the platform first reveals the length of their hashtag signatures. Next appear the two sequences, line by line\u2014one representing the first influencer\u2019s array of hashtags, the other the second\u2019s. After data for all pairs is logged, the platform must respond with a clear verdict for each pair: \u201cYES\u201d if the pair can, through these exchanges, transform their signatures into identical patterns, or \u201cNO\u201d if no sequence of moves can achieve that harmony.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a scenario where two influencers have three hashtags each: one begins with \u201ccbc,\u201d the other with \u201caba.\u201d A single Prefix-Suffix Exchange, where they trade one hashtag from the start of the first\u2019s sequence for one from the end of the second\u2019s, transforms their patterns into matching sequences \u201cabc.\u201d In another instance, longer signatures pave the way for many exchanges and intricate reordering before eventual alignment is struck, proving that sometimes multiple strategic swaps unravel the tangled identities into unity. However, not every pair finds alliance; some signatures are too divergent to ever be made to match despite any number of exchanges, reflecting the stubborn individuality these hashtags represent.\n\nThus unfolds the deciding saga of compatibility on SocialNetia: can the two influencers, wielding the power of prefix-suffix exchanges on their signature hashtags, unify their digital branding into perfect symmetry? The platform, as the ultimate judge, awaits the story of each pair, pronouncing \u201cYES\u201d or \u201cNO\u201d as the final chorus of this dance of digital identity reshaping.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou have two strings s_1 and s_2 of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters. You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:\n\n- Choose a positive integer 1 \\leq k \\leq n.\n- Swap the prefix of the string s_1 and the suffix of the string s_2 of length k.\n\nIs it possible to make these two strings equal by doing described operations?\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\n\nEach test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 10^5) \u2014 the length of the strings s_1 and s_2.\n\nThe second line contains the string s_1 of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nThe third line contains the string s_2 of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" if it is possible to make the strings equal, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n7\n3\ncbc\naba\n5\nabcaa\ncbabb\n5\nabcaa\ncbabz\n1\na\na\n1\na\nb\n6\nabadaa\nadaaba\n8\nabcabdaa\nadabcaba\n\nSample Output 1\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\nIn the first test case:\n\n- Initially s_1 = \\mathtt{cbc}, s_2 = \\mathtt{aba}.\n- Operation with k = 1, after the operation s_1 = \\mathtt{abc}, s_2 = \\mathtt{abc}.\n\nIn the second test case:\n\n- Initially s_1 = \\mathtt{abcaa}, s_2 = \\mathtt{cbabb}.\n- Operation with k = 2, after the operation s_1 = \\mathtt{bbcaa}, s_2 = \\mathtt{cbaab}.\n- Operation with k = 3, after the operation s_1 = \\mathtt{aabaa}, s_2 = \\mathtt{cbbbc}.\n- Operation with k = 1, after the operation s_1 = \\mathtt{cabaa}, s_2 = \\mathtt{cbbba}.\n- Operation with k = 2, after the operation s_1 = \\mathtt{babaa}, s_2 = \\mathtt{cbbca}.\n- Operation with k = 1, after the operation s_1 = \\mathtt{aabaa}, s_2 = \\mathtt{cbbcb}.\n- Operation with k = 2, after the operation s_1 = \\mathtt{cbbaa}, s_2 = \\mathtt{cbbaa}.\n\nIn the third test case, it's impossible to make strings equal.",

However, the interval only 'passes the compatibility check' if the mightiest cell\u2019s signature is perfectly aligned as an exact multiple of the meekest one. This harmony signals a balanced genetic motif, promising higher stability or potential for evolution. Each Lab cycle involves numerous such segments, where the Master tirelessly catalogs those pairs where this genetic alignment occurs. The Lab handles multiple such chains daily, each chain containing tantalizingly many cells\u2014up to half a million\u2014and it ensures that adding up all daily observations still respects this massive scale.\n\nThe Master's mission\u2014your task\u2014is to precisely tally, for each chain studied, how many such pairs of cell intervals pass this sacred check. From the input chamber, you will receive on the first line the number of independent experimental trials conducted that day. Each trial begins with a line stating the total count of cells in the gene chain for that experiment. Following on the very next line will be the sequence of positive integers describing the genetic strength of each cell, presented in exact order from the first to the last. It is your duty to output for each trial a single number on its own line\u2014the total count of intervals making it through the compatibility screening.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a chain of one cell marked just '1'. There exists exactly one interval\u2014the cell itself\u2014and since the strongest and weakest markers coincide and '1' is naturally a perfect multiple of itself, the count is one. In a longer chain like two cells marked '2' and '4', three intervals fit the bill: each cell alone, and the pair combined, as the larger one is always divisible by the smaller. Contrastingly, a chain reading '2' and '3' yields fewer compatible segments, since the duo together falters in harmony, producing just two passing intervals. The Master's logs extend through many such trials, successively revealing intricate counts\u2014ranging from solitary passed intervals to ranges numbering in the tens\u2014mapping the genetic skewers of endless life strands. Your analytic prowess will empower the Lab to comprehend not only individual segments but the complex dance of genomic multiples cascading through colossal sequences.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n of positive integers.\n\nFind the number of pairs of indices (l, r), where 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n, that pass the check.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the mystical realm of Eldoria, brave puzzle seekers gather each year to face the legendary Runestone Puzzle Trials. These trials are set in a grand chamber lined with enchanted stones, each inscribed with ancient numbers representing hidden powers. Within this chamber, an array of mystic runestones lies before the challenger\u2014each stone engraved with a number that pulses with arcane energy. The rules of the trial declare that the number of stones in the array must be between two and five hundred, ensuring the complexity challenges every intellect but remains solvable.\n\nThe trial unfolds over a series of turns equal to the number of stones. At the start, each challenger\u2019s score is zero, symbolizing their untarnished potential. During the i-th turn, the seeker faces a crucial choice: they may either leave the stones as they are or perform a sacred ritual that alters the array\u2019s fabric. This ritual allows them to exchange the position of just one pair of neighboring stones\u2014but at a mystical cost. After swapping these two adjacent stones, the challenger must choose one of the two stones involved in the swap and extinguish its glowing power, reducing its value to zero. The other stone keeps its original strength intact. Should the seeker decide not to invoke the ritual on a given turn, the stones remain unchanged for that round.\n\nWith each turn\u2019s conclusion, the mystical energies of the stone that originally held position i in the sequence are added to the challenger\u2019s growing score\u2014no matter how the stones have been shifted or dimmed in prior turns. The ultimate ambition is to harness these currents of power to amass the highest possible total score by the end of the trial, extracting the mightiest sum from the once-inert arrangement. In this challenge, efficiency is key\u2014not merely abiding by the rules but maximizing the summoning of these numerical forces.\n\nThe input to the trial is presented as follows: first, a single number representing the count of arcane stones lies inscribed in a language natural to Eldoria\u2019s scribes\u2014between two and five hundred. On the next line, the values of the stones\u2019 powers are written sequentially\u2014each a whole number rising up to a million, reflecting the might of that stone\u2019s latent magic. After these inscriptions, the challenger must determine and declare one number, the grand tally\u2014the maximal score conceivable under the sacred trial\u2019s conditions.\n\nTo illuminate with examples, consider a trial beginning with two stones, their powers etched as three and one. A wise adventurer might choose to preserve the first stone\u2019s power intact in the first turn, adding three to their score. On the second turn, invoking the ritual to swap these neighboring stones, the challenger then dims the stone that initially bore the value one\u2014turning it into a shadow with zero power. Yet, because the value of the stone originally in the first position now returns again, they add three once more, culminating in a highest total of six. In a grander trial with five stones bearing powers seven, three, nine, six, and twelve, the seeker who deftly maneuvers swaps and extinguishings can harness a formidable sum reaching fifty-two, showcasing their mastery of the runes.\n\nThus, within the chamber of the Runestone Puzzle Trials, challengers weave through the delicate balance of preservation and sacrifice, all in pursuit of the supreme tally\u2014the score not only possible but perfected under the ancient laws of Eldoria\u2019s arcane arithmetic lives.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou're given an array consisting of n integers. You have to perform n turns.\n\nInitially your score is 0.\n\nOn the i-th turn, you are allowed to leave the array as it is or swap any one pair of 2 adjacent elements in the array and change exactly one of them to 0(and leave the value of other element unchanged) after swapping. In either case(whether you swap or not), after this you add a_i to your score.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible score you can get?\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \\le n \\le 500).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le 10^6).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum possible score.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n2\n3 1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n6\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5\n7 3 9 6 12\n\nSample Output 2\n\n52\n\nNote\nIn the first example, to get the maximum score we do as follows. Do nothing on the first turn, add 3 to the score. Swap the first and the second elements and turn 1 to 0 on the second turn, and add 3 to the score. The final score is 6.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the realm of the Shifting Labyrinth, a sprawling maze floats in endless space, its winding corridors filled with echoes of countless echoes and a tapestry of hidden powers. Within this enchanted maze, there exists a long, enchanted chain of ancient runes, each glowing with a unique, radiant symbol. The length of this chain is vast\u2014no more than three hundred thousand runes, but never fewer than one. Alongside the chain, the maze\u2019s mystics frequently pose riddles and challenges, numbering up to three hundred thousand in count, each demanding keen insight and swift decision.\n\nThe core magic of this labyrinth revolves around the pattern and frequency of these glowing runes. Each rune holds a positive magical essence, a value shining bright but bounded only by the realm\u2019s immense unknowns, so vast that the highest essence number might rival the stars themselves. The labyrinth\u2019s rules allow two kinds of interventions during the mystics\u2019 trials. First, one may decide to alter the essence of any single rune in the chain, transforming its shining number into another\u2014still positive\u2014essence, changing the labyrinth\u2019s very fabric in an instant. Second, the mystics may present a segment of the chain\u2014any continuous stretch of runes they choose\u2014and inquire whether every unique essence present within that segment appears in quantities perfectly balanced by a mysterious rhythm, called the \u201cdivisor.\u201d This divisor never exceeds the length of the chosen segment, ensuring that the rhythm is meaningful within the context of the runes it measures.\n\nThe labyrinth\u2019s greatest challenge is to respond to each mystic\u2019s riddle: when asked to transform a particular rune\u2019s essence, the task is straightforward\u2014perform the change seamlessly. But when asked to verify the balance of a segment against this rhythm, one must determine if all the individual essences within that segment appear a number of times that are exact multiples of the given divisor. If the answer is yes, the labyrinth resonates with harmony and one replies with an emphatic \u201cYES\u201d; if even a single essence is out of sync with the rhythm, the answer must be a solemn \u201cNO.\u201d This must be executed efficiently, for with hundreds of thousands of runes and queries, the labyrinth demands swift calculation and perfect memory.\n\nTo record these encounters, the mystics first declare the length of the rune chain and the number of queries they will pose, each on a single line: two whole numbers not exceeding three hundred thousand. On the next line, the essences of each rune are revealed as a multitude of positive numbers, each echoing the boundless magnitude of the arcane. Following this, each of the succeeding lines describes one command, either the alteration of a single rune\u2019s essence\u2014identified by its location in the chain and replaced by a new shining essence\u2014or a query describing the segment\u2019s starting and ending points along with the divisor rhythm to check.\n\nFor instance, imagine a chain of ten runes with essences shining as 1234, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Among eight mystic queries, the first asks if in the first six runes all essences dance perfectly to the rhythm of two. Since the single appearances of the essence \u20181\u2019 do not fit this rhythm, the answer given is \u201cNO.\u201d Then, the first rune\u2019s essence changes from its mighty 1234 to a humble 1, subtly shifting the labyrinth\u2019s tune. The third query reassesses the harmony of the first six runes, now glowing with essences 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, and 1; all essences here pair perfectly to the rhythm of two, so the answer here is \u201cYES.\u201d Later on, shifts and queries continue, each spell transforming the labyrinth, weaving answers of \u201cNO\u201d and \u201cYES\u201d according to the hidden balance of the runic counts.\n\nThus, the Chronicles of the Shifting Labyrinth unfold through the delicate dance of change and query, the ever-moving chain of runes responding to the rhythmic calls of mystics. Within this magical expanse, the goal is not simply to follow the rhythm but to answer with clarity and speed whether harmony reigns or chaos stirs within each chosen subarray of runes, a reflection of the labyrinth\u2019s unending flux and timeless challenge.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou have an array a consisting of n positive integers and you have to handle q queries of the following types:\n\n- 1 i x: change a_{i} to x,\n- 2 l r k: check if the number of occurrences of every positive integer in the subarray a_{l}, a_{l+1}, \\ldots a_{r} is a multiple of k (check the example for better understanding).\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and q (1 \\le n , q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5), the length of a and the number of queries.\n\nNext line contains n integers a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots a_{n} (1 \\le a_{i} \\le 10^9) \u2014 the elements of a.\n\nEach of the next q lines describes a query. It has one of the following forms.\n\n- 1 i x, (1 \\le i \\le n , 1 \\le x \\le 10^9), or\n- 2 l r k, (1 \\le l \\le r \\le n , 1 \\le k \\le n).\n\nOutput Format\nFor each query of the second type, if answer of the query is yes, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\".\n\nSample Input 1\n\n10 8\n1234 2 3 3 2 1 1 2 3 4\n2 1 6 2\n1 1 1\n2 1 6 2\n2 1 9 2\n1 10 5\n2 1 9 3\n1 3 5\n2 3 10 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\n\nNote\nIn the first query, requested subarray is [1234, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1], and it's obvious that the number of occurrence of 1 isn't divisible by k = 2. So the answer is \"NO\".\n\nIn the third query, requested subarray is [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1], and it can be seen that the number of occurrence of every integer in this sub array is divisible by k = 2. So the answer is \"YES\".\n\nIn the sixth query, requested subarray is [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3], and it can be seen that the number of occurrence of every integer in this sub array is divisible by k = 3. So the answer is \"YES\".",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\n**Underground Hacker\u2019s Terminal Log: Operation Diffusion**\n\nIn the shadowy depths of the neon-glowing cybernet, a rogue coder named Cipher Zero trains their focus on encrypted arrays transmitted through an ancient protocol. Each array, a chain of digital nodes, stores numeric values\u2014vital pulses within the grid. The arrays can stretch, at minimum, two nodes and at most a few hundred thousand\u2014enough to conceal complex transformations. Their numeric values pulse anywhere from small fragments of data to bursts nearing a billion units.\n\nCipher Zero operates under a strict, unyielding logic governed by the matrix's rules: they are allowed to hijack any contiguous segment within an array, beginning somewhere before it ends, and rewrite all nodes in that segment with a new value derived from the digital gap between the segment's edges. Specifically, the new value for the whole segment becomes the absolute magnitude of the difference between the values at the segment's start and end points. This operation can be performed repeatedly\u2014countless times, zero or more\u2014on any valid segment within the array. The gritty aim: coax the array\u2019s values to align so that, when tallied at the end, the sum of every node\u2019s value reaches its highest potential, squeezing every last bit of numeric juice from the data chain.\n\nThrough the data stream, Cipher Zero receives multiple test arrays to crack\u2014some chains as brief as two nodes, and others sprawling over hundreds of thousands, yet the cumulative complexity remains within manageable bounds. For each chain, Cipher Zero must calculate the optimal transformation sequence, printing out the final maximum aggregated sum of the array after all allowed operations. The input echoes precisely: the first line whispers how many separate arrays await decryption; for each array, a prompt first states its length, then reveals its nodes on the following line. Cipher Zero\u2019s output is simple yet crucial\u2014a single line per array, the supremum value of the transformed array's sum.\n\nAn example transmission clarifies the challenge's core: three arrays arrive. The first, a modest trio of identical nodes, locked at ones, respects its immutable sum of three\u2014no transformation can surpass this boundary. The second, a pair where extremes clash\u2014nine and one\u2014yields a powerful operation: choosing the whole segment and swapping all nodes with the difference (eight) inflates the sum to sixteen. The third, a triad of four, nine, and five, resists further enhancement beyond eighteen, even after the permitted operations weave their magic through its nodes.\n\nCipher Zero\u2019s terminal finally outputs the solutions line by line, confirming the mastery of the digital crypt. The struggle between data and code culminates in each transformed array's maximum bounty, a testament to the hacker\u2019s understanding of the cryptic art of operation diffusion.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array a of n integers. You are allowed to perform the following operation on it as many times as you want (0 or more times):\n\n- Choose 2 indices i,j where 1 \\le i < j \\le n and replace a_k for all i \\leq k \\leq j with |a_i - a_j|\n\nPrint the maximum sum of all the elements of the final array that you can obtain in such a way.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array a.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the elements of array a.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print the sum of the final array.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n3\n1 1 1\n2\n9 1\n3\n4 9 5\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3\n16\n18\n\nNote\nIn the first test case, it is not possible to achieve a sum > 3 by using these operations, therefore the maximum sum is 3.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that the maximum sum achievable is 16. By using operation (1,2) we transform the array from [9,1] into [8,8], thus the sum of the final array is 16.\n\nIn the third test case, it can be shown that it is not possible to achieve a sum > 18 by using these operations, therefore the maximum sum is 18.",

        "question_title": "Wonderful Jump",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the mystic land of Alchemoria, witches and warlocks travel through the enchanted path known as the Sequence of Luminescent Stones. These stones form a grand line of glowing gems, their numbers stretching across the horizon in lengths that can reach as vast as hundreds of thousands. Each stone hums with a secret power, a glowing intensity that every traveler knows well. To cross from one stone to another, a sorcerer must pay the price determined by the talisman\u2019s glow beneath their feet and the distance they leap.\n\nThe law of the Sequence dictates that a witch may jump forward from the stone they currently stand upon to any stone that lies ahead or right where they are. The cost of such a jump is measured by the faintest glow along the path she wishes to fly, multiplied by the square of the number of stones she skips past. For example, if a witch stands on stone one and chooses to land on stone four, she must take into account the faintest glow among stones one, two, three, and four; this faint glow is multiplied by the squared count of stones she crossed during this leap. Traveling through this path is no trivial matter\u2014it demands cleverness to minimize the toll paid in mystical coins called eris.\n\nYour challenge as an apprentice witch is to chart the minimal magical toll to reach every stone beginning with the very first luminous gem in the line. For each stone from the first to the last, you must determine the least number of eris needed to arrive there, starting hopelessly at the first gem with no cost paid. The sequence\u2019s length can be immense, stretching to a realm as high as 400,000 stones, with each glow intensity ranging anywhere from the quietest whisper of 1 to the brightest blaze, which will never outnumber the stones themselves. The goal is not merely to survive the journey, but to do so with the utmost efficiency, minimizing your eris expenditure for each advancement.\n\nTo present your findings to the Grand Council of Sorcery, you must prepare two lines of sacred scripts. On the first line, record the count of stones in your sequence. On the second line, inscribe the glow intensities of each stone, in the order they stand stretched through the land. Afterward, the council expects to see the minimal eris costs for your passage to every stone, starting from the first, inscribed as a sequence of numbers each corresponding to your calculated cost of arrival on that stone. This sequence will provide future witches with a guiding light for their journeys.\n\nConsider the tale sung by the fiery stones in the tale of three luminaries whose glows are 2, then 1, then 3. The first gem demands no cost to stand upon\u2014no journey has yet occurred. To reach the second gem from the first, the faintest glow along the path is one, and having skipped one stone, the toll is a single eris. Continuing to the third gem, the wisest way is to stop once at the second gem before the third, making two eris in total: the sum of the tolls for each leap, each weighed by the squared skipping distance and the faintest glow encountered. This tale confirms that even long paths need not cost more than their smallest illuminated whispers multiplied wisely.\n\nSo, apprentice witch, prepare your magic array, decipher the whispers of the luminescent path, and reveal the minimal eris tolls that will allow the greatest journeys with the least expense. Your acumen shall weave through the glowing stones, from the first to the last, lighting the way for all who dare follow.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array of positive integers a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n of length n.\n\nIn one operation you can jump from index i to index j (1 \\le i \\le j \\le n) by paying \\min(a_i, a_{i + 1}, \\ldots, a_j) \\cdot (j - i)^2 eris.\n\nFor all k from 1 to n, find the minimum number of eris needed to get from index 1 to index k.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \\le n \\le 4 \\cdot 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\\ldots a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le n).\n\nOutput Format\nOutput n integers\u00a0\u2014 the k-th integer is the minimum number of eris needed to reach index k if you start from index 1.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n2 1 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n0 1 2\n\nSample Input 2\n\n6\n1 4 1 6 3 2\n\nSample Output 2\n\n0 1 2 3 6 8\n\nSample Input 3\n\n2\n1 2\n\nSample Output 3\n\n0 1\n\nSample Input 4\n\n4\n1 4 4 4\n\nSample Output 4\n\n0 1 4 8\n\nNote\nIn the first example:\n\n- From 1 to 1: the cost is 0,\n- From 1 to 2: 1 \\rightarrow 2 \u2014 the cost is \\min(2, 1) \\cdot (2 - 1) ^ 2=1,\n- From 1 to 3: 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \u2014 the cost is \\min(2, 1) \\cdot (2 - 1) ^ 2 + \\min(1, 3) \\cdot (3 - 2) ^ 2 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nIn the fourth example from 1 to 4: 1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 \u2014 the cost is \\min(1, 4, 4) \\cdot (3 - 1) ^ 2 + \\min(4, 4) \\cdot (4 - 3) ^ 2 = 4 + 4 = 8.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\n**Investigator's Log: The Case of the Odd Occurrence Cipher**\n\nIn the labyrinthine urban sprawl, a certain enigmatic figure known as Hossam left behind a curious sequence of cryptic numbers etched across scattered walls. This numerical tapestry was no random scrawl; it was a chain of many symbols, stretching up to two hundred thousand characters in length, each symbol representing a number anywhere from the smallest unit to an astronomical figure nearing one billion. It was whispered that this sequence held secrets locked by the rhythm of their appearances\u2014a puzzle begging to be unraveled.\n\nThe codex entrusted to me revealed a challenge woven into daily inquiries. A number of quests, up to two hundred thousand as well, would arrive sequentially, each requesting comprehension of a specific stretch within the grand sequence\u2014from one mark to another. However, the catch was not simply to find the smallest symbol in that slice, but to focus on those whose presence was uncommon enough: appearing an odd number of times within that fragment. Should no such symbol exist, zero would be the sign of emptiness, the void of oddity itself. Curiously, the boundaries of these inquiries were hidden beneath layers of secrecy, encoded by coupling the fresh question with the answer from the previous riddle, toggling bits in a cryptic dance. Yet, it was guaranteed that the deciphered start and end of each slice were valid marks along the grand sequence.\n\nMy task in this gritty urban maze was to decode each query in strict order, revealing for each the smallest symbol appearing an odd number of times in the given segment\u2014no delays, no second guesses. Efficiency was paramount: the city demanded swift and accurate deciphering, no more than two hundred thousand riddles and ten million possible symbol values to sift through. The outcome for each quest had to be clear\u2014print the singular smallest odd-frequency cipher or nothingness marked by zero, line by line, as the answers emerged from the shadows.\n\nFor instance, consider a sequence of five numbers: 1, 2, 1, 2, and 2. Following six queries, each crafted by cryptic transformations, the unraveling revealed the smallest odd-frequency symbols in segments such as from the first to the second mark or from the first to the fifth. The answers steadily came: first the number one, then two, then circling back to one, then a null zero when none fit the odd criterion, followed by two again for the last two queries. In another case, a longer sequence spanning ten symbols whispered of dozens of answers, each the smallest odd-frequency symbol between specifically coded boundaries, ranging from 19 to 76 and spirited by the city's numerical pulse.\n\nThus, the urban legend insists: equipped with a towering chain of numerals and a string of coded inquiries, reveal at each turn the smallest cipher whose frequency dances to the odd beat within the given confines\u2014or reveal the silence of zero if none dare to appear as such. Each answer, a step along the illuminated path, untangles the city\u2019s arcane interplay of numbers forever etched in the investigator\u2019s log.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nHossam gives you a sequence of integers a_1, \\, a_2, \\, \\dots, \\, a_n of length n. Moreover, he will give you q queries of type (l, \\, r). For each query, consider the elements a_l, \\, a_{l + 1}, \\, \\dots, \\, a_r. Hossam wants to know the smallest number in this sequence, such that it occurs in this sequence an odd number of times.\n\nYou need to compute the answer for each query before process the next query.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains one integer n (1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5), the length of the sequence.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, \\, a_2, \\, \\dots, \\, a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9).\n\nThe third line contains one integer q (1 \\le q \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5), the number of queries.\n\nEach of the next q lines contains two integers a and b (0 \\le a, \\, b \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9), the numbers used to encode the queries.\n\nLet \\mathrm{ans}_i be the answer on the i-th query, and \\mathrm{ans}_0 be zero. Then l_i = a_i \\oplus \\mathrm{ans}_{i - 1}, r_i = b_i \\oplus \\mathrm{ans}_{i - 1}, where l_i, \\, r_i are parameters of the i-th query and \\oplus means the bitwise exclusive or operation. It is guaranteed that 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each query, print the smallest number that occurs an odd number of times on the given segment of the sequence.\n\nIf there is no such number, print 0.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n1 2 1 2 2\n6\n1 2\n0 2\n0 6\n0 5\n2 2\n3 7\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\n2\n1\n0\n2\n2\n\nSample Input 2\n\n10\n51 43 69 48 23 52 48 76 19 55\n10\n1 1\n57 57\n54 62\n20 27\n56 56\n79 69\n16 21\n18 30\n25 25\n62 61\n\nSample Output 2\n\n51\n55\n19\n48\n76\n19\n23\n19\n55\n19\n\nNote\nIn the example,\n\nl_1 = 1, \\, r_1 = 2, l_2 = 1, \\, r_2 = 3, l_3 = 2, \\, r_3 = 4, l_4 = 1, \\, r_4 = 4, l_5 = 2, \\, r_5 = 2, l_6 = 1, \\, r_6 = 5.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the realm of the Chrono-Keepers, time is woven together through an intricate network called the Temporal Arbor\u2014a magnificent tree where each node represents a nexus point in time. The foremost nexus, known as the Prime Root, holds a unique significance as the origin of all temporal paths. Upon these nodes lie numerical seeds, each carrying the potential to influence the flow and coherence of timelines that branch out endlessly. The guardians of time are tasked with a delicate mission: to ensure that any journey from the Prime Root to a terminal nexus\u2014those endings with only a single tether to the rest of the Temporal Arbor and never being the Prime Root themselves\u2014exerts no residual temporal strain, a mysterious property that the keepers understand as a balanced energy represented by a \u201czeroed temporal resonance.\u201d\n\nAccording to the sacred protocols, manipulating these temporal seeds involves re-tuning them to any serene, non-negative number, reflecting a state of calmness within the timeline. However, changing these values is a costly act, consuming precious resources and risking disturbances elsewhere. The rules stipulate that the Temporal Arbor always contains at least two nodes but never exceeds a grand scale of a hundred thousand ties, ensuring the keepers manage a sprawling yet navigable structure. Every seed starts with a vibrant energy, neither trivial nor infinite, but contained within a vast spectrum of possibilities. The nodes link together forming a web without loops\u2014each nexus connects with others in such a way that there\u2019s a singular root and a definite pathway to every other node.\n\nThe keepers\u2019 ultimate challenge is to perform the minimum number of recalibrations so that following any path from the Prime Root down to a terminal nexus, the combined temporal seeds along that path, when intertwined through the enigmatic process of temporal resonance cancellation (akin to weaving patterns that perfectly negate each other), yield a state of perfect equilibrium\u2014no lingering energy, no paradoxical echoes. This task demands a solution not just satisfactory but optimally frugal, preserving the delicate balance of the Temporal Arbor while minimizing the costly recalibrations of the seeds.\n\nThe invocation of their ritual begins with the declaration of how many nexus points inhabit the Temporal Arbor. Next comes a detailed account of the initial temporal seed energies present at each nexus, lined up sequentially from the prime to the farthest reaches. Thereafter, sacred links between pairs of nexus points are chronicled one by one, each bond strengthening the web of time without creating cycles, ensuring the integrity of the temporal flow. Upon performing their calculations, the keepers present a singular revelation: the precise minimal number of recalibrations\u2014those sacred adjustments\u2014to bring every timeframe to harmonious stasis.\n\nFor example, a network of six nexus points with their initial seed energies given, connected thoughtfully, reveals that changing three pivotal nodes\u2019 energies suffices to quiet all temporal echoes. Another case with eight nodes necessitates three changes again, while a simpler four-node arbor needs none at all, for the paths already resonate in tranquility. Yet a grander nine-node framework finds balance with barely two recalibrations. The keepers use these chronicles to guide future endeavors, ensuring the Temporal Arbor remains the stalwart backbone of time\u2019s seamless voyage.\n\nThus, the chronomancers continue their vigilant watch, forever tuned to the subtle dance of temporal energies, optimizing the Temporal Arbor to guard against the chaos of unbalanced time, all while performing the fewest leaf node adjustments necessary to maintain perfect harmony in the eternal flow.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nLuoTianyi gives you a tree with values in its vertices, and the root of the tree is vertex 1.\n\nIn one operation, you can change the value in one vertex to any non-negative integer.\n\nNow you need to find the minimum number of operations you need to perform to make each path from the root to leaf^{\\dagger} has a bitwise XOR value of zero.\n\n^{\\dagger}A leaf in a rooted tree is a vertex that has exactly one neighbor and is not a root.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \\le n \\le 10^5) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9), the i-th number represents the value in the i-th vertex.\n\nNext n-1 lines describe the edges of the tree. The i-th line contains two integers u_i and v_i (1 \\le u_i,v_i \\le n, u_i \\neq v_i) \u2014 the vertices connected by an edge of the tree. It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of operations.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n6\n3 5 7 5 8 4\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n3 5\n4 6\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3\n\nSample Input 2\n\n8\n7 10 7 16 19 9 16 11\n1 5\n4 2\n6 5\n5 2\n7 2\n2 3\n3 8\n\nSample Output 2\n\n3\n\nSample Input 3\n\n4\n1 2 1 2\n1 2\n2 3\n4 3\n\nSample Output 3\n\n0\n\nSample Input 4\n\n9\n4 3 6 1 5 5 5 2 7\n1 2\n2 3\n4 1\n4 5\n4 6\n4 7\n8 1\n8 9\n\nSample Output 4\n\n2\n\nNote\nThe tree in the first example:\n\nIf we change the value in the vertex 2 to 3, the value in the vertex 5 to 4, and the value in the vertex 6 to 6, then the tree will be ok.\n\nThe bitwise XOR from the root to the leaf 2 will be 3 \\oplus 3=0.\n\nThe bitwise XOR from the root to the leaf 5 will be 4 \\oplus 7 \\oplus 3=0.\n\nThe bitwise XOR from the root to the leaf 6 will be 6 \\oplus 5 \\oplus 3=0.\n\nThe tree in the second example:\n\nIf we change the value in the vertex 2 to 4, the value in the vertex 3 to 27, and the value in the vertex 6 to 20, then the tree will be ok.\n\nThe bitwise XOR from the root to the leaf 6 will be 20 \\oplus 19 \\oplus 7=0.\n\nThe bitwise XOR from the root to the leaf 8 will be 11 \\oplus 27 \\oplus 4 \\oplus 19 \\oplus 7=0.\n\nThe bitwise XOR from the root to the leaf 4 will be 16 \\oplus 4 \\oplus 19 \\oplus 7=0.\n\nThe bitwise XOR from the root to the leaf 7 will be 16 \\oplus 4 \\oplus 19 \\oplus 7=0.\n\nIn the third example, the only leaf is the vertex 4 and the bitwise XOR on the path to it is 1 \\oplus 2 \\oplus 1 \\oplus 2 = 0, so we don't need to change values.\n\nIn the fourth example, we can change the value in the vertex 1 to 5, and the value in the vertex 4 to 0.\n\nHere \\oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the realm of the Dream Architect Simulator, the grand dreamscape is woven from a vast tapestry of shimmering threads, each thread spinning a unique sequence of mysterious symbols. The Master Weaver LuoTianyi reveals a sacred scroll containing a sequence of symbols arranged along a line, where every symbol\u2019s position is marked from the first thread to the last, reaching up to one million in length. Dreamers call this sequence the \"Array of Shadows,\" and each symbol within this array bears a power value that also lies somewhere between the first strand and the millionth strand of the dreamscape.\n\nIn this dream realm, the fabric of connections is governed by a complex enchantment known as the Chain of Inclusion. For two chosen segments of the fabric, defined by their start and end strands, the Chain of Inclusion conjures a guardian integer that represents the loftiest possible strand from which one can stretch a magic net that fully overlaps the shadow symbols on the first segment within the second segment's span. If the starting strand of the first segment ever surpasses that of the second, the guardian always vanishes, becoming zero. Thus, each guardian threads a delicate balance, ensuring the contents of one segment of the dream can be found, hidden but complete, within the bounds of another segment descending through the shimmering realm.\n\nLuoTianyi challenges the dream architects to unravel the mysteries encoded in multiple ancient queries, each composed of two pairs of strand intervals. The first pair defines a range along the line to consider from a lower bound to an upper bound of starting strands, while the second pair stretches another range where the ending strands range from one strand to another. For each query, the architects must sum the guardians conjured by all combinations of starting and ending strands within these specified intervals. The puzzle\u2019s grand scale lies in efficiently weaving through these vast measures of dream threads \u2014 up to one million in count for both symbols and queries \u2014 while capturing the guardians\u2019 total strength across the queried dimensions.\n\nEach dream challenge begins with a scroll stating the total number of strands in the shadow sequence and the number of queries that will follow. On the next scroll line, the sequence of symbol powers is inscribed\u2014each symbol\u2019s power quietly nestled between the very first and last threads of the dreamscape. Following this, each query is presented in its own line as four sacred numbers: the lower and upper bounds of the starting strand segment, immediately alongside the lower and upper limits of the ending strand segment, all properly respecting the order and limits of the dream threads. The architects must then inscribe answers for each query on a new scroll line\u2014capturing the full sum of guardians conjured within those bounds.\n\nFor instance, in one dream journey, the shadow sequence held six strands bearing powers [1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 4], and four challenges followed. When the architects sought to know the combined guardian power between the first strand\u2019s start interval up to itself and ending strands from the fourth to fifth, the magic ledger revealed a sum of six, drawn from guardian values that whispered \u201c3\u201d on adjacent stands within the netted range. Another test asked about segments where the starting and ending strands were fixed tightly or overlapped trivially, showing how some guardians flicker to zero when their bounds do not align properly. In a grander dream where the sequence reached ten strands, nuanced calculations balanced partial overlaps and nested segments\u2014illustrating the weaving artistry needed and the power drawn from understanding the dream web\u2019s finer connections.\n\nThus, the architects continue their sacred work, unraveling each query of strand intervals and weaving the total strength of guardians summoned by the Chain of Inclusion, ensuring that every answer fully reflects the dreams\u2019 intricate design and eternal complexity.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nLuoTianyi gives you an array a of n integers and the index begins from 1.\n\nDefine g(i,j) as follows:\n\n- g(i,j) is the largest integer x that satisfies \\{a_p:i\\le p\\le j\\}\\subseteq\\{a_q:x\\le q\\le j\\} while i \\le j;\n- and g(i,j)=0 while i>j.\n\nThere are q queries. For each query you are given four integers l,r,x,y, you need to calculate \\sum\\limits_{i=l}^{r}\\sum\\limits_{j=x}^{y}g(i,j).\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (1\\le n,q\\le 10^6) \u2014 the length of the array a and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n (1\\le a_i\\le n) \u2014 the elements of the array a.\n\nNext q lines describe a query. The i-th line contains four integers l,r,x,y (1\\le l\\le r\\le n, 1\\le x\\le y\\le n) \u2014 the integers in the i-th query.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint q lines where i-th line contains one integer \u2014 the answer for the i-th query.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n6 4\n1 2 2 1 3 4\n1 1 4 5\n2 3 3 3\n3 6 1 2\n6 6 6 6\n\nSample Output 1\n\n6\n6\n0\n6\n\nSample Input 2\n\n10 5\n10 2 8 10 9 8 2 1 1 8\n1 1 10 10\n2 2 3 3\n6 6 6 6\n1 1 4 5\n4 8 4 8\n\nSample Output 2\n\n4\n2\n6\n4\n80\n\nNote\nIn the first example:\n\nIn the first query, the answer is g(1,4)+g(1,5)=3+3=6.\n\nx=1,2,3 can satisfies \\{a_p:1\\le p\\le 4\\}\\subseteq\\{a_q:x\\le q\\le 4\\}, 3 is the largest integer so g(1,4)=3.\n\nIn the second query, the answer is g(2,3)+g(3,3)=3+3=6.\n\nIn the third query, the answer is 0, because all i > j and g(i,j)=0.\n\nIn the fourth query, the answer is g(6,6)=6.\n\nIn the second example:\n\nIn the second query, the answer is g(2,3)=2.\n\nIn the fourth query, the answer is g(1,4)+g(1,5)=2+2=4.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn a long-forgotten civilization, great sages sought wisdom through the sacred **Number Rituals**\u2014ancient ceremonies where sequences of symbols, inscribed on scrolls, could be rearranged by precise mystical operations to reveal hidden truths. Each scroll bore a line of sacred glyphs, each glyph marked with a number drawn from a limited set no greater than the scroll's own length. This length reflected the power of the ritual, stretching from a single glyph up to one million in the grandest ceremonies.\n\nThe laws of the Number Rituals were strict yet elegant. A sage could perform a particular enchantment any number of times\u2014possibly never\u2014by choosing a position on the scroll and invoking a swap between the glyph seated there and another glyph seated at the place indicated by the number inscribed on the first chosen glyph. This magical swap could rearrange the order of glyphs but only in ways sanctioned by the mysterious connection each glyph held to another spot on the scroll, as dictated by its own number. The sages knew that the numbers inscribed were never outside the scroll\u2019s length, ensuring all movements remained within the sacred bounds.\n\nThe ultimate question posed to the initiates was this: from one original arrangement recorded on the scroll, how many unique configurations of glyphs could possibly emerge by any sequence of these mystical swaps? This was not merely a puzzle of steps but a quest to find the full extent of transformation potential\u2014how many distinct patterns could be unearthed, counting only those configurations that could be reached through these sacred operations, and reporting the answer in the grand modulus of ten to the ninth power plus seven, a cosmic number ensuring the count always stayed within focused limits.\n\nThe ceremony\u2019s scrolls were presented as follows: the first line revealed the length of the scroll\u2014how many glyph places it contained. Then, on the next line, the sequence of numbers inscribed at each glyph was displayed, one after another, each within the scroll\u2019s bounds. After ritual contemplation, the sage offered a number, whispered as the count of all attainable glyph arrangements from the original, expressed according to the sacred modular formula to reveal the final truth.\n\nConsider the first ceremony, where the scroll had three glyphs marked with [1, 1, 2]. The sages found that performing the ritual once by choosing the third glyph and swapping it with the place indicated by its number (the second glyph) led to the only other form [1, 2, 1]. No other configurations could be coaxed from these symbols, so the answer was two. In another instance, four glyphs bore [2, 1, 4, 3], and the ritual could reveal four distinct configurations. A grander scroll of six glyphs, marked [2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2], unveiled eighteen unique patterns through the sacred swaps of the Number Rituals.\n\nThus, the lost civilization\u2019s mystics framed their quest: given the length and original inscriptions on the scroll, determine the full spectrum of shapes the Number Rituals might reveal\u2014counting all distinct, reachable arrangements and honoring the ancient modular limit of (10^9 + 7). These were the secrets penned in the scrolls, awaiting those who could unlock the hidden permutations of the enchanted glyphs.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array of integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le n). You can perform the following operation several (possibly, zero) times:\n\n- pick an arbitrary i and perform swap(a_i, a_{a_i}).\n\nHow many distinct arrays is it possible to attain? Output the answer modulo (10^9 + 7).\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \\le n \\le 10^6).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n (1\\le a_i\\le n).\n\nOutput Format\nOutput the number of attainable arrays modulo (10^9 + 7).\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n1 1 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n\nSample Input 2\n\n4\n2 1 4 3\n\nSample Output 2\n\n4\n\nSample Input 3\n\n6\n2 3 1 1 1 2\n\nSample Output 3\n\n18\n\nNote\nIn the first example, the initial array is [1, 1, 2]. If we perform the operation with i = 3, we swap a_3 and a_2, obtaining [1, 2, 1]. One can show that there are no other attainable arrays.\n\nIn the second example, the four attainable arrays are [2, 1, 4, 3], [1, 2, 4, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 1, 3, 4]. One can show that there are no other attainable arrays.",

The `visited` array prevents revisiting already explored configurations, ensuring that the count is accurate.\n\n\n\n",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nUnder the veil of the night, the Midnight Radio Broadcast Archive hums quietly, a mystical vault holding the secrets of countless past transmissions. Tonight, the archivist faces a curious puzzle woven into the fabric of the station\u2019s legacy: a series of spectral towers, each containing layers of coded whispers that must be interpreted carefully. These towers, aligned precisely one after another, hold ethereal integers\u2014messages ranging from the first tower all the way to the last, never reaching beyond the total count of these towers, which can be as grand as hundreds of thousands but never more.\n\nThe rules governing these spectral towers are ancient and strict. Each tower's depths are layered: the oldest whispers rest at the very bottom, while the freshest messages gather at the peak. A special recursive spell, known as \u201cinit,\u201d can be invoked on any tower\u2019s index within this chain. When the spell is called on a particular tower, the process dives into the topmost message of that tower and uses this message's own numerical identity as a pointer to the next tower to engage. Upon performing this magical peek, the top message is then vanquished\u2014removed from its tower. This chaining continues endlessly, hopping tower to tower according to the latest message found atop each one, peeling away layers until a mysteriously empty tower is revealed. Upon such revelation, the number matching that desolate tower\u2019s position is sung back as the final answer to the spell. This ritual resets every time, so calling \u201cinit\u201d on any tower summons this ghostly sequence anew, untouched and unaltered by prior invocations.\n\nYour task as the archivist is daunting: for each tower, from the very first to the very last, you must invoke this spell and record the final echo it returns. This means immersing into the depths of the tower\u2019s layered messages precisely as they are catalogued\u2014never changing their order in the archive, but only mentally performing these vanishing acts and pointers within a faithful simulation. Since these chains are unpredictable and may tank through hundreds of thousands of messages across all towers combined, your challenge is to recollect and reproduce the final returned number for every initial invocation with swift accuracy. The archive expects a line-by-line recount\u2014each line presenting the numeral recited by invoking the spell on the corresponding tower in ascending order.\n\nTo illustrate, imagine three towers. The first tower contains three layers with messages whispering numbers one, two, then two again from bottom up; the second towers\u2019 layers conceal three messages: three, one, and two; the third tower holds three messages too: one, two, and one. Calling the spell on the first tower propels through a cascade of towers as the needle hops from one tower\u2019s top message to the next, peeling layers, until finally revealing an empty tower whose position can only be one. The chant returns one for the first invocation. When invoked on the second tower, the spell\u2019s journey leads to an empty tower at position two, returning the number two. The third invocation, starting from the third tower, similarly journeys until it finds the tower positioned at two, which is empty after said peels, returning the number two. Thus, the archivist notes down the signs: one, two, two, standing methodically upon a single line of the broadcast archive report.\n\nIn a grander example with five towers, each packed heavily with layers of messages, the spell\u2019s intricate dance interestingly ends on the foremost tower every single time, singling out the number one repeatedly for each invocation. This harmonizes the grand archive into a line of ones: one, one, one, one, one. Each invocation, though complex, ultimately steers back to the first sentinel tower\u2019s empty throat, marking a unifying conclusion.\n\nWith this midnight mystery decoded, the archive\u2019s wisdom is preserved precisely\u2014even as recursive whispers echo through the night, their secrets laid bare for those who dare to listen and recount.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou have n stacks r_1,r_2,\\ldots,r_n. Each stack contains some positive integers ranging from 1 to n.\n\nDefine the following functions:\n\nYou want to know the values returned by \\texttt{init(1)}, \\texttt{init(2)}, \\ldots, \\texttt{init(n)}.\n\nNote that, during these calls, the stacks r_1,r_2,\\ldots,r_n don't change, so the calls \\texttt{init(1)}, \\texttt{init(2)}, \\ldots, \\texttt{init(n)} are independent.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains one integer n (1\\le n\\le 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array r.\n\nEach of the following n lines contains several integers. The first integer k_i (0\\le k_i\\le 10^5) represents the number of elements in the i-th stack, and the following k_i positive integers c_{i,1},c_{i,2},\\ldots,c_{i,k_i} (1\\le c_{i,j}\\le n) represent the elements in the i-th stack. c_{i,1} is the bottom element.\n\nIn each test, \\sum k_i\\le 10^6.\n\nOutput Format\nYou need to output n values, the i-th of which is the value returned by \\texttt{init(i)}.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n3 1 2 2\n3 3 1 2\n3 1 2 1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1 2 2\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5\n5 1 2 4 3 4\n6 1 2 5 3 3 4\n6 1 1 4 4 4 2\n9 3 1 4 2 3 5 5 1 2\n4 4 4 1

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\n**Background**\n\nIn the enchanted realm of Clockwork Circus, the Mechanical Puppet Theatre showcases wondrous performances orchestrated by intricate sequences of puppets\u2019 steps. Each puppet\u2019s movement is represented by a series of choreographed numbers \u2014 non-negative integers \u2014 that form the rhythm of their dance. These sequences must adhere to the strict conventions whispered in the gears and springs of the puppets' ancient manual to captivate the audience with the perfect mechanical harmony.\n\n**Rules and Problem Setting**\n\nThe theatre\u2019s lore teaches that a \u201cfancy\u201d puppet sequence is one where the dance follows two crucial laws. First, amidst the rhythmic numbers, at least one must belong to a sacred band of consecutive steps, starting from a special pivot number and continuing through a span of certain length. This ensures the performance hits the hallmark motifs cherished by the audience. Second, the jumps between each consecutive movement are never wild \u2014 the difference between any adjacent numbers in the sequence is always within the bounds of this pivot span, never too far to disrupt the mechanical flow. This ensures the puppets move gracefully, neither too abruptly nor too languidly, preserving the theatre\u2019s precision.\n\n**Task Explanation**\n\nYou are entrusted with a task from the Master Clocksmith: for several performances, each defined by the length of the puppet sequence, the chosen pivot of sacred steps, and the allowed stride span, you must determine how many distinct \u201cfancy\u201d sequences of movements can be constructed. The sequences must be fully compliant, embracing the sacred motif at least once, and maintaining the mechanical difference constraint throughout their lengths. Since the possible variations can swell beyond counting by the naked eye \u2014 sometimes as large as a billion moves \u2014 the Master requests the tally to be reduced according to the cosmic modulus engraved on the Theatre\u2019s grand gear: dividing by a large magic number and reporting only the remainder.\n\nEach performance you evaluate comes as a scroll with three numbers: the length of the sequence (the count of puppet steps), the start of the sacred motif band, and the breadth of the allowed jump between steps. The number of performances (test cases) you must consider is inscribed upon the first page of your scroll.\n\n**Examples and Closing**\n\nFor instance, consider a dance of length three, where the sacred motif begins at zero and the allowed jump span is one. There, nine distinct sequences mesmerize the gaze \u2014 all containing steps from zero through zero plus one minus one, and maintaining gentle strides. Similarly, a single-step dance starting at a motif pivot of four with a generous stride span of twenty-five yields twenty-five dazzling variances, all eye-catching and permitted. For a four-step dance starting at seven with hops of size two, the choreography swells to 582 possible sequences. As the ultimate challenge, a billion-step dance starting at a motif of forty and with the jumping range immense as the theatre itself, reaches into the hundreds of millions in variation, counted as 514035484 under the grand modulation.\n\nThus, for each test case inscribed on the scroll, your duty is to recite the number of allowed and truly \"fancy\" sequences, honoring the arcane mechanical laws of the Puppet Theatre \u2014 ensuring each movement sequence is both valid and counted precisely within the gearworks of this eternal stage.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nLet's call an array a of n non-negative integers fancy if the following conditions hold:\n\n- at least one from the numbers x, x + 1, ..., x+k-1 appears in the array;\n- consecutive elements of the array differ by at most k (i.e. |a_i-a_{i-1}| \\le k for each i \\in [2, n]).\n\nYou are given n, x and k. Your task is to calculate the number of fancy arrays of length n. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 10^9+7.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 50)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains three integers n, x and k (1 \\le n, k \\le 10^9; 0 \\le x \\le 40).\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of fancy arrays of length n, taken modulo 10^9+7.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4\n3 0 1\n1 4 25\n4 7 2\n1000000000 40 1000000000\n\nSample Output 1\n\n9\n25\n582\n514035484\n\nNote\nIn the first test case of the example, the following arrays are fancy:\n\n- [0, 0, 0];\n- [0, 0, 1];\n- [0, 1, 0];\n- [0, 1, 1];\n- [0, 1, 2];\n- [1, 0, 0];\n- [1, 0, 1];\n- [1, 1, 0];\n- [2, 1, 0].",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\n**[Terminal Log: Cipherpunk Node #7428 \u2013 Entry Begin]**\n\nIn the shadowed digital undercity, two encrypted sequences of characters formed the core of a cryptic puzzle\u2014one sequence denoted by a shorter string of lowercase glyphs, and its greater, lengthier counterpart. These sequences represented coded messages carved in mysterious script, where the shorter message and the longer one were made of English lowercase letters and held secret structural relationships. The lengths of these sequences were known quantities: the shorter message\u2019s length was less than the longer\u2019s, but neither were trivial\u2014they could span millions of characters, stretching the limits of data infiltration and analysis.\n\nThe network\u2019s encoding rules dictated a peculiar synthesis pattern for these messages. The shorter message was thought to be fragmented not just once, but in a triadic structure: a prefix fragment, a middle fragment, and a suffix fragment, seamlessly combined. Meanwhile, the longer message was built like a fractal echo\u2014starting with the same prefix fragment, followed by one or more repeated middle fragments (at least once, potentially many times), and finally closing with the same suffix fragment. In more arcane terms, finding where and how to slice the original shorter message into three parts\u2014first, middle, and last\u2014became essential, since those parts\u2019 arrangement explained how the longer message echoed the structure with repeated middle segments.\n\nYour covert mission, once you accessed the encrypted feed, was to identify how many unique ways such triple partitions existed that satisfied these rules: the shorter message must split into exactly three substrings that perfectly reconstruct it when concatenated, and using those substrings, the longer message must be formed in a similar manner but with the middle substring duplicated multiple times between the fixed prefix and suffix. The operative challenge was efficiency and scalability\u2014these sequences could be vast; the lengths published on the first line of the data stream revealed the shorter message\u2019s length followed by the longer message\u2019s, where the shorter was always strictly less in length but both possibly very large (up to ten million characters). The next two data lines contained the encoded strings themselves, each composed solely of lowercase letters.\n\nThe decoded output your process should produce was a single number\u2014a tally of every valid triple partition that could unlock this layered repetition: every viable triple segment demarcation where the longer message\u2019s recurring middle matched the inferred repetition count and structure exactly. This number captured the richness of repeated subsequence patterns, revealing how many ways the shorter could grow into the longer by repeating the middle cipher fragment.\n\nHistorically, certain intercepted feeds demonstrated this encryption design in practice. One cryptogram, with a four-character seed and an eight-character evolved form, yielded just one valid triple: starting with a single character \u201ca,\u201d followed by a double-character \u201cbc\u201d repeated thrice, and closed with \u201cd.\u201d Another, a simpler triple \u201caaa\u201d growing into the five-length \u201caaaaa,\u201d revealed five discrete ways to partition and repeat that middle segment. A far more complex twelve-to-sixteen character weave of \u201cabbababacaab\u201d to a greatly expanded form revealed eight legitimate triples, involving multiple prefix and suffix lengths and varying repeated middle segments, indicating deeper repetition layers\u2014like \u201cab\u201d paired with \u201cba\u201d extending outward, or longer middle fragments such as \u201cbaba\u201d inserted repeatedly before the suffix.\n\nThese logs offered a piercing glimpse into the cryptosystem\u2019s inner work: such triple partitions were no mere curiosities\u2014they were the core structural keys, hinting at repeated message patterns and encoded protocols waiting to be deciphered. Your job was to parse these inputs\u2014first the two large integers on a single line representing lengths, then the shorter string on the next line, and the longer one on the line after\u2014to output a single integer per case: the count of all valid triples. Only by mastering this pattern-matching could one hope to pry open the encrypted world within.\n\n**[Terminal Log: Cipherpunk Node #7428 \u2013 Entry End]**\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given two strings s, t of length n, m, respectively.

        "question_title": "Maximum Sum Subarrays",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the whimsical world of Retro Toy Catalogs, there existed a peculiar challenge embraced by catalog compilers: two long rows of toy figurines, each representing vibrant characters with distinct power readings. Every catalog entry was precisely arranged with these two rows standing side by side, each containing the same number of figurines. The compilers had the unique liberty to swap the positions of any pair of figurines standing directly across from each other\u2014they could exchange the figurine on the left row with its counterpart on the right row as many times as they wished. These figurines bore numerical powers ranging from formidable strengths to baffling weaknesses, some even carrying negative power values representing fragile or faulty toys.\n\nThe enchanted catalog system also held a magical property for any row: if you picked a sequence of figurines standing in contiguous order, the sum of their combined powers could be measured, and among all such sequences including even the prospect of selecting none, the greatest sum defined the \"maximum power streak\" of that row. Since these swaps only affected figurines standing face-to-face, the compilers sought a marvelous strategy to exchange figurines so that the combined strength\u2014the sum of the maximum power streaks from both rows\u2014would be as high as possible. The core challenge was not just to make this sum acceptable but to maximize it to the very best extent.\n\nCatalog entries came by batches: the first detail of each batch revealed the number of figurines in those two rows. On the next line, the exact powers of the figurines in the first (left) row were revealed, and immediately following that, on another line, the powers of the figurines in the second (right) row were shown in the same order. This pattern repeated for numerous batches, each containing between one figurine to a few hundred thousand; however, the total combined number of figurines across all batches never exceeded a limit set by the magic of the compiler\u2019s world. The task entrusted to the compiler was clear: for every batch of figurines, the compiler must determine the highest possible value of the combined maximum power streaks after performing any number of swaps allowed by the enchanted rules.\n\nConsider the illustrative legend from a typical catalog compilation: in the first batch, three figurines each stood on the left and right rows. Their powers were [2, -1, 3] on the left and [-4, 0, 1] on the right. By swapping certain figurines one-by-one at their positions, the compiler discovered a way to achieve a combined maximum power streak totaling six. In a grander batch of six figurines with powers on the left row [4, 2, -6, 1, 6, -4] and on the right [-6, -2, -3, 7, -3, 2], the compiler's strategic swapping unlocked an enormous sum of twenty-one. Lastly, two figurines with powers [-2, -5] faced off against [0, -1], but even with swaps, the highest achievable maximum power streak sum remained zero, since negative or zero power was unavoidable.\n\nThus, the role of the Retro Toy Catalog Compiler was to master this swapping magic, transforming figurines in each batch to conjure the mightiest sum of contiguous toy powers between two rows. Each test received through this enchanted system sought the answer: what was the supreme combined power streak reachable, illuminating the catalog with the most dazzling arrays of toy figurines?\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given two integer arrays a and b, both of length n.\n\nYou can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): swap a_i and b_i.\n\nLet f(c) be the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of the array c (including the empty subsegment, which sum is 0).\n\nYour task is to calculate the maximum possible value of f(a) + f(b), using the aforementioned operation any number of times.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 \\le t \\le 10^4)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n (-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9).\n\nThe third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n (-10^9 \\le b_i \\le 10^9).\n\nThe sum of n over all test case doesn't exceed 2 \\cdot 10^5.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum possible value of f(a) + f(b), using the aforementioned operation any number of times.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n3\n2 -1 3\n-4 0 1\n6\n4 2 -6 1 6 -4\n-6 -2 -3 7 -3 2\n2\n-2 -5\n0 -1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n6\n21\n0",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the quaint workshop of the legendary clockmaker, time did not merely tick\u2014it danced in patterns bound by peculiar laws. Among his curiosities was a peculiar ledger, filled with rows of intricate numbers, each representing the strength of tiny cogwheels embedded within his vast network of timepieces. There were as many cogwheels as the stars visible on a clear night, a number so great it could almost be imagined as two hundred thousand in a single glance, each carrying a positive vitality less than a billion, a measure of their capacity to count seconds and moments.\n\nThe clockmaker\u2019s world, however, held a unique ritual for every pair of these cogwheels. Whenever any cogwheel bonded with another\u2014a bond as intimate as the joining of two hands in the delicate dance of time\u2014their combined strength was not merely the sum of their parts but was judged by the sum of the individual digits in their combined vitality. This sacred sum, called the \"Essence of Digits,\" was meticulously observed for every pair formed from the entire collection of cogwheels, including when a cogwheel met itself. The clockmaker\u2019s rule was clear: for every cogwheel, one must gather the total Essence of Digits produced from bonding it with every other cogwheel in the workshop, measuring how their strengths intertwine and amplify the harmony of the ticking world.\n\nThe clockmaker\u2019s noble quest, then, was to carefully calculate this grand symphony of numbers\u2014to produce, for each cogwheel in his sprawling collection, a single value representing the total Essence of Digits it achieves when paired with all others. This grand total must be found for each cogwheel independently but precisely, reflecting not only the clockmaker\u2019s intricate affections for detail but also an efficiency worthy of his meticulous craft, as he sought a clear, swift understanding despite the vastness of his assembly.\n\nTo record this knowledge, the clockmaker\u2019s notebook must begin with a single line indicating the total count of cogwheels in the collection\u2014a number resting between the modest pair and the expansive legion of two hundred thousand. On the very next line, a sequence of their individual strengths is inscribed, each strength a single robust number under a billion yet always a positive force. The return to the ledger must be a line-by-line chronicle of total Essences: for the first cogwheel, the sum of digital essences it conjures with every one; for the second, and so forth, until the ledger finally unveils the harmonious totals for each of the cogwheels arranged in their original order.\n\nFor example, consider the case where the clockmaker sees four cogwheels with strengths of one, three, three, and seven. The final record would reveal the totals as eighteen, seventeen, seventeen again, and fifteen respectively, showcasing subtle variations born from the digital dances. Another tale tells of three potent cogwheels bearing strengths of forty-two, one thousand three hundred thirty-seven, and nine hundred ninety-nine, whose total Essences culminate in thirty-eight, fifty-three, and forty-seven. These numbers speak to the clockmaker\u2019s art, a testament to his ritual\u2019s precision and the captivating complexity of time\u2019s endless rhythm.\n\nThus, within the clockmaker\u2019s routine notebook lies the eternal reflection of cosmic order, where bonding cogwheels pulse in the sum of their digitized spirits, and every entry echoes the symphony of a world kept in perfect, numerical cadence.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array [a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n], consisting of positive integers.\n\nFor every i from 1 to n, calculate \\sum \\limits_{j=1}^{n} F(a_i + a_j), where F(x) is the sum of digits of x.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains one integer n (2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n (1 \\le a_i < 10^9).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint n integers.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the heart of a war-torn kingdom, nestled among vast battlefields, there existed a strategic board representing the intricate clash between light and shadow. This battlefield stretched over a grid of seven by seven, where each square bore the mark of either the white banners of peace or the black flags of wartime forces. The commander, Vladislav, grappled with a unique challenge: to harmonize the colors so that no black soldier stood amidst a deadly formation where all four of his diagonal comrades were also clad in black, for such clusters invited chaos and weakened their lines.\n\nThe realm's laws of engagement dictated that any alteration to this delicate web of warriors required a precious and deliberate action called the \u201cflip\u201d\u2014choosing any single square and reversing its allegiance from black to white or vice versa. Yet each flip was costly, and Vladislav sought the fewest such maneuvers to ensure that no black warrior found himself surrounded diagonally on all four corners by fellow black soldiers. The battlefield could host up to two hundred such distinct engagements, or test cases, each describing a fresh mosaic of black and white across the seven by seven grid tapestry.\n\nVladislav\u2019s mission was clear: For every engagement laid before him, meticulously examine the grid row by row and column by column. Reading each line written in the codified script of \u2018W\u2019 for white and \u2018B\u2019 for black, he must calculate the smallest number of flips required to dissolve any ominous black cluster completely. The victory was not just in compliance but in executing this transformation with the utmost efficiency\u2014minimal disruption with maximum strategic advantage.\n\nFor example, in one fateful script where two black cells breached the sacred diagonal harmony, a solitary flip before dawn sufficed to restore order and flush out the threat. In another, where the darkness was denser and more entangled, two flips were the key to breaking apart such black formations. There were moments of quiet satisfaction when the battleground was already balanced, needing no flips at all, and others when a flurry of five flips valiantly restored the fragile equilibrium.\n\nIn the chronicles of Vladislav's campaigns, the input began simply with the number of battles to be strategized. Each battle was then described through the seven lines of coded squares, detailing the color of each spot on the field. His reports would end with a singular number for each encounter, revealing the minimum flips executed to cleanse the battlefield of dangerous black clusters.\n\nThus, the tale concludes with the records from a series of battles:\n\n- In the first clash, only one decisive flip was wielded to scatter the darkness.\n- In the second, a pair of flips forged the pathway to salvation.\n- The third battle needed no attention; the lines were already pure.\n- The fourth required five measured flips to restore the light\u2019s command.\n\nThrough these chronicles, Vladislav\u2019s strategic mind continued to illuminate the art of balance between shadows and light across the ancient battlefield\u2019s grid.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nVladislav has a grid of size 7 \\times 7, where each cell is colored black or white. In one operation, he can choose any cell and change its color (black \\leftrightarrow white).\n\nFind the minimum number of operations required to ensure that there are no black cells with four diagonal neighbors also being black.\n\nThe left image shows that initially there are two black cells violating the condition. By flipping one cell, the grid will work.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \\leq t \\leq 200)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of 7 lines, each containing 7 characters. Each of these characters is either \\texttt{W} or \\texttt{B}, denoting a white or black cell, respectively.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum number of operations required to ensure that there are no black cells with all four diagonal neighbors also being black.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4\nWWWWWWW\nWWWWBBB\nWWWWWBW\nWWBBBBB\nWWWBWWW\nWWBBBWW\nWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWW\nWBBBBBW\nWBBBBBW\nWBBBBBW\nWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWW\nWWWWWWW\nWBBBBBW\nBBBBBBB\nBBBBBBB\nWWWWWWW\nBBBBBBB\nBBBBBBB\nBBBBBBB\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\n2\n0\n5\n\nNote\nThe first test case is illustrated in the statement.\n\nThe second test case is illustrated below:\n\nIn the third test case, the grid already satisfies the condition.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the vast wilderness of the Monster Evolution Realm, each creature has a unique set of favorite rituals\u2014activities that fuel their power and strengthen their bonds. There are many such creatures, counted in the hundreds of thousands, each identified by a number from the first born to the last. The array of possible rituals they may cherish extends into the millions, from elaborate dances to elemental forges. The ancient lore holds that for any pair of monsters to form a truly powerful bond, they must not only share some common ritual but also embrace distinctly different ones, enriching each other\u2019s spirits beyond mere similarity.\n\nThe sacred rules dictate the nature of a worthy pairing: a match is considered worthy if the two creatures have at least one ritual in common. Yet, this alone is insufficient. To be strong and balanced, each one must also treasure a unique ritual the other does not know or practice\u2014a sign of diversity and growth within their union. The total sum of every creature\u2019s favored rituals combined never breaches a million, ensuring the realm\u2019s knowledge remains manageable by the Seers who oversee these bonds. Creatures may have no rituals at all or up to the full breadth of the known rituals, but each ritual they honor appears only once in their list.\n\nThe great quest posed to the Keepers of Bonds is to discern whether such a worthy pairing exists among all the creatures. The first scroll given to the Keepers lists two numbers: the vast count of creatures and the immense variety of rituals known. Following this, each line unfurls the count of rituals favored by a given creature, followed by the exact ritual numbers they cherish\u2014each distinct and carefully noted. The Keepers must read these descriptions with keen eyes, for their task is to declare if a worthy pairing lives in their fold. If such a bond exists, they must reveal the numbers of the two creatures who achieve this perfect balance of shared passion and unique difference.\n\nAs an example, imagine three creatures and five possible rituals. The first creature delights in three rituals: one, two, and four. The second holds heart for all five rituals, while the third delights in only two: one and five. Here, the bond between the first and third creature shines brightly: they both cherish ritual one, yet the third brings ritual five to the circle, a secret to the first, and the first offers ritual four, unknown to the third\u2014fulfilling the ancient criteria perfectly. Their pairing is declared worthy, while any other combination falters on one condition or the other.\n\nAnother tale tells of three creatures with three rituals known. One loves only the first ritual, another only the second, and the third embraces all three but fails to form a worthy bond with the others. The overlap is too thin or the unique rituals too few, and so the Keepers must sadly announce that no worthy pairing exists among them.\n\nThus, the Keepers of Bonds must read the creature counts and ritual counts from the first line of the scroll, then descend line by line into each creature\u2019s secret preferences. Their duty is to shout \u201cYES\u201d and name the bonders if a worthy pair arises; otherwise, to quietly state \u201cNO,\u201d preserving the balance of the Monster Evolution Realm until the next search begins.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are the developer of a dating app which ignores gender completely. The app has n users, indexed from 1 to n. Each user's profile features a list of the activities they enjoy doing. There are m possible activities, indexed from 1 to m.\n\nA match between two users is good if they share at least one activity and, at the same time, both of them like at least one activity that the other user does not like.\n\nFind a good match if it exists.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 \\leq n \\leq 200\\,000, 1 \\leq m \\leq 10^6) \u2014 the number of users and the number of activities.\n\nEach of the following n lines contains a number k_i (0 \\leq k_i \\leq m) \u2014 the number of activities that user i likes \u2014 followed by k_i distinct integers from 1 to m \u2014 the activities user i likes.\n\nIt is guaranteed that k_1+k_2+\\cdots+k_n does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint \\texttt{YES} if a good match exists. Otherwise, print \\texttt{NO}.\n\nIf a good match exists, on the next line print two integers\u00a0\u2014 the indexes of two users that make a match.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 5\n3 1 2 4\n5 1 2 3 4 5\n2 1 5\n\nSample Output 1\n\nYES\n3 1\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3 3\n1 1\n1 2\n3 2 3 1\n\nSample Output 2\n\nNO\n\nNote\nIn the first sample, users 1 and 3 form a match, because they share activity 1, and, furthermore, user 3 likes activity 5 (which user 1 does not like) and user 1 likes activity 4 (which user 3 does not like). Note that users 1 and 2, as well as users 2 and 3, do not form a match, as there is no activity that users 1 or 3 like, and user 2 doesn't like.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the bustling floating market of Lenora, merchants trade with a peculiar kind of treasure\u2014sticks of varying lengths, each one carefully numbered and cataloged. These sticks are no ordinary wares; their lengths carry tales of the farthest forests and the strongest winds. The market elders have set a grand accounting challenge for the traders, for they believe that true prosperity lies in understanding how these sticks can come together to form stable, triangular tokens of fortune. In this floating bazaar, the total number of sticks can be as massive as one hundred thousand, and equally manifold are the merchants\u2019 questions that must be answered about the mysterious potential of these lengths.\n\nAccording to the market\u2019s ancient laws, to form a valid triangular token\u2014the true symbol of balance\u2014the three sticks chosen must be able to lean against each other, with no side stretching so long as to collapse the shape. Formally, none of these three chosen sticks can be as lengthy as the sum of the other two. Moreover, the elders pose a challenge of greater detail: within any given range of sticks, can the savvy merchant select precisely six unique sticks that can be separated into two sets of three, each set forming its own stable triangle? It is essential that these six sticks come from a contiguous segment of the numbered collection, defined by two marks on the ledger specifying where to start and end. No segment from the ledger can be too small\u2014each must hold at least six sticks for the task to be considered.\n\nEvery merchant arrives with their ledger query, specifying exactly which stretch of the ensemble they wish to examine, pointing from one number to another such that their chosen segment holds enough sticks to forge at least two triangular tokens. Their grand ambition is not just to find any two triangles, but to confirm if it is possible at all\u2014if the sticks within these bounds can be paired into two stable triangles based on the sacred triangular laws. These queries, as numerous as the waves beneath the floating market, demand swift and sure answers: a simple affirmation when the feat is feasible, or a decisive negation when not. In the language of the market, these responses come as \u201cYES\u201d or \u201cNO,\u201d their variations in tone and script welcomed as long as they convey certainty.\n\nFor example, suppose a merchant\u2019s ledger includes ten numbered sticks, their lengths a motley of values such as five, two, two, ten, four, ten, six, one, five, and three. If the query targets the segment from the first to the sixth stick, the merchant quickly notes two possible triangular tokens hidden amongst these lengths\u2014one crafted from lengths two, four, and five, another from two, ten, and ten\u2014and hence the answer gleams \u201cYES.\u201d When another question points from the second to the seventh stick, the calculation falters, as no suitable pair of triangles can be found, issuing the forbidding \u201cNO.\u201d \n\nIn this way, the ledger becomes a vital scroll, unfolding line by line: the first line revealing the grand count of sticks alongside the number of queries, the second line listing each stick\u2019s recorded length in order, and then the following lines detailing each query\u2019s segment bounds. The merchant must respond in kind, offering each query\u2019s fate clearly and promptly, whispering decades of wisdom into simple affirmations or denials, ensuring the floating market\u2019s harmony is preserved and celebrated.\n\nThus, the floating market merchants continue their dance, turning numbers into stories of balance and structure, their ledger records shimmering with the echoes of ancient triangles formed anew with every new question\u2014each \u201cYES\u201d and \u201cNO\u201d a testament to the magic of geometry and commerce entwined upon the gentle waves.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given n sticks, numbered from 1 to n. The length of the i-th stick is a_i.\n\nYou need to answer q queries. In each query, you are given two integers l and r (1 \\le l < r \\le n, r - l + 1 \\ge 6). Determine whether it is possible to choose 6 distinct sticks from the sticks numbered l to r, to form 2 non-degenerate triangles^{\\text{*}}.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (6 \\le n \\le 10^5, 1 \\le q \\le 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of sticks and the number of queries respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n (1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 a_i denotes the length of the i-th stick.\n\nEach of the following q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \\le l < r \\le n, r - l + 1 \\ge 6)\u00a0\u2014 the parameters of each query.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each query, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to form 2 triangles, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\n\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n10 5\n5 2 2 10 4 10 6 1 5 3\n1 6\n2 7\n2 8\n5 10\n4 10\n\nSample Output 1\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nNote\nIn the first query, the lengths of the sticks are [5, 2, 2, 10, 4, 10]. Two sets of sticks [2, 4, 5] and [2, 10, 10] can be selected to form 2 non-degenerate triangles.\n\nIn the second query, the lengths of the sticks are [2, 2, 10, 4, 10, 6]. It can be shown that it is impossible to form 2 non-degenerate triangles.\n\nIn the third query, the lengths of the sticks are [2, 2, 10, 4, 10, 6, 1]. Two sets of sticks [1, 2, 2] and [4, 10, 10] can be selected to form 2 non-degenerate triangles.\n\nIn the fourth query, the lengths of the sticks are [4, 10, 6, 1, 5, 3]. It can be shown that it is impossible to form 2 non-degenerate triangles.\n\nIn the fifth query, the lengths of the sticks are [10, 4, 10, 6, 1, 5, 3]. Two sets of sticks [1, 10, 10] and [3, 4, 5] can be selected to form 2 non-degenerate triangles.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the bustling city of Luminaria, preparations for the grand Lantern Festival were underway. Among the many traditions, a unique challenge fascinated the townsfolk: a long paper ribbon adorned with magical numbers glowed softly, each square in the ribbon holding a secret value\u2014some positive, some negative, some zero. This ribbon, always only one square tall but stretching across many squares, was the key to a puzzling game that the clever townsman Bob had embraced.\n\nThe rules of this enchanted game were as follows: the ribbon, composed of a known fixed number of squares\u2014never less than one and never more than a hundred thousand\u2014must be parted into exactly three smaller ribbons by slicing along the borders between squares. Each of the three segments must have at least one square to preserve their integrity; no piece could be empty. The magical numbers within each segment could be summed, and for the challenge to be satisfied, the sums from these three segments must all be the same. This meant the magic of the ribbon was balanced, no one segment outweighing the glory of the others. Yet, the townsfolk could only cut at the borders, never slicing through a square itself. The values in each square swayed within a certain range, never soaring beyond a ten-thousand mark in magnitude, either positive or negative.\n\nBob\u2019s quest was to discover how many distinct ways he could perform these two cuts to create three perfectly balanced segments from his ribbon. The challenge was not merely to find one way\u2014he eagerly sought every possible way the ribbon could be so divided. Each valid slicing corresponded to a moment of perfect harmony where the segments\u2019 sums echoed one another. The task was thus to count all such harmonious divisions: to record, given the length of the ribbon and the sequence of magical numbers, how many triple-partitions maintained equal sums, carefully cutting only at square borders, with no segment left behind empty.\n\nTo aid in documenting his findings, Bob prepared his journal entries in a precise format. On the first line of the log, the length of the ribbon\u2014the number of squares\u2014was recorded, a single integer. On the next line, the sequence of the magical numbers on each square was laid out, spaced lovingly one after another. After meditating on the patterns, Bob would note, as a single integer on a fresh page, how many ways the ribbon could be sliced accordingly to meet the magical balance.\n\nIn an earlier instance, when Bob examined a ribbon of four squares bearing the numbers one, two, three, and three, he found exactly one way to cut it just right: producing three parts whose totals shimmered equally. In another trial with five squares inscribed with one, two, three, four, and five, the magic refused to align, and no such balanced three-part division existed. Thus the record was clear\u2014sometimes harmony smiled once, other times not at all.\n\nThus, through these meticulous entries, the city of Luminaria treasured the secret art of dividing magical ribbons\u2014celebrating the delicate balance of numbers within the Lantern Festival\u2019s radiant heart.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nOnce Bob took a paper stripe of n squares (the height of the stripe is 1 square). In each square he wrote an integer number, possibly negative. He became interested in how many ways exist to cut this stripe into three pieces so that the sum of numbers from each piece is equal to the sum of numbers from any other piece, and each piece contains positive integer amount of squares. Would you help Bob solve this problem?\n\nInput Format\nThe first input line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105) \u2014 amount of squares in the stripe. The second line contains n space-separated numbers \u2014 they are the numbers written in the squares of the stripe. These numbers are integer and do not exceed 10000 in absolute value.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput the amount of ways to cut the stripe into three non-empty pieces so that the sum of numbers from each piece is equal to the sum of numbers from any other piece. Don't forget that it's allowed to cut the stripe along the squares' borders only.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4\n1 2 3 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nSample Output 2\n\n0",

Before him lay an enchanted grid carved from ancient ivory and onyx, shaped as a rectangle with rows and columns\u2014each small cell harboring a mysterious integer, some whispered dark as negatives, others bright as positives. The stage could be measured by the number of rows and columns, never too vast, for the theatre's magic capped the grid\u2019s shape to no more than a hundred rows and a hundred columns, each number no larger or smaller than one hundred in absolute power.\n\nThe Master declared the magical laws thus: Harry could wield two spells, each a delicate toggling of signs. The first spell, a wave of his wand along a single row, would invert all the numbers resting in that chosen row, flipping their essences from dark to bright or vice versa. The second spell, a flick along a specific column, would do the same but only for the integers perched in that column. However, the deeper purpose was not mischief but balance: after casting, every row and every column must shine with a sum of numbers that is never shadowed\u2014that is, none must total less than zero.\n\nYet the challenge was deeper still. Harry must summon this harmony while performing these spells sparingly and efficiently, casting the fewest number of row and column inversions to restore the grid\u2019s harmonious balance in its entirety. The theatre demanded precision: no row or column could be enchanted more than once, else the magic would unravel and the spell reflexively revert. Thus, Harry was tasked to find a careful selection\u2014to decide exactly which rows to toggle and which columns to dance his spell upon\u2014so that the sum of each line of the grid gleamed non-negative.\n\nThe Master\u2019s link to the mundane world was precise: first Harry must announce the count of rows he would enchant on the very first line, followed by the distinct indexes of those rows, all on the same line, their ranks counted from the top of the grid downwards. On the very next line, he must reveal the count of columns to be altered, along with their respective distinct indexes, from left to right across the grid. If no columns required enchantment, that count would be zero, followed by no numbers on that line. The order of the chosen rows and columns had no importance, just their correctness and distinctness.\n\nAs a testament to the theatre\u2019s logic, consider the first enchanted tableau, a narrow strip of four rows but only a single column bearing the number negative one throughout. The only way to bring light was to illuminate each row individually, inverting each of the four minds held captive by those cells. Thus the declaration was loud and clear: four rows enchanted\u2014numbers one, two, three, and four\u2014with no columns swayed. In contrast, on a smaller stage of two rows and four columns where darker numbers clustered, the grateful solution was to enchant only one row and one column\u2014for instance, flipping the first row and then the fourth column\u2014to bring balance and harmony, each line holding a non-negative sum.\n\nAnd so the story closes\u2014Harry, with your swift wand and clear reasoning, you must strategize these enchantments\u2014no more, no less\u2014turning darkness into light across the mystical grid, obeying the rules laid out by the Master of Enchantments, crafting a perfect harmony of numbers on this mechanical stage.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nHarry Potter has a difficult homework. Given a rectangular table, consisting of n x m cells. Each cell of the table contains the integer. Harry knows how to use two spells: the first spell change the sign of the integers in the selected row, the second \u2014 in the selected column. Harry's task is to make non-negative the sum of the numbers in each row and each column using these spells.\n\nAlone, the boy can not cope. Help the young magician!\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, \u00a0m \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of rows and the number of columns.\n\nNext n lines follow, each contains m integers: j-th integer in the i-th line is ai, j (|ai, j| \u2264 100), the number in the i-th row and j-th column of the table.\n\nThe rows of the table numbered from 1 to n. The columns of the table numbered from 1 to m.\n\nOutput Format\nIn the first line print the number a \u2014 the number of required applications of the first spell. Next print a space-separated integers \u2014 the row numbers, you want to apply a spell. These row numbers must be distinct!\n\nIn the second line print the number b \u2014 the number of required applications of the second spell. Next print b space-separated integers \u2014 the column numbers, you want to apply a spell. These column numbers must be distinct!\n\nIf there are several solutions are allowed to print any of them.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4 1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n-1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n4 1 2 3 4\n0\n\nSample Input 2\n\n2 4\n-1 -1 -1 2\n1 1 1 1\n\nSample Output 2\n\n1 1\n1 4",

        "question_title": "Tree",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the Kingdom of Postalia, there was a vast network of villages connected by mystical pathways without any loops or circular routes\u2014only one unique way to travel between any two villages. This network was affectionately called the Great Tree by the locals, for it branched out like a mighty tree, its trunk at one village and spreading gracefully to the others. The number of villages in this kingdom could go up to a few hundred and, at times, even seven hundred treasures were mapped on this grand tree.\n\nNow, the curious Bob, a master puzzlemancer, devised a new challenge for Postalia's travelers. He would allow participants to sever some of these enchanted pathways\u2014possibly none, some, or even all, but never to break the kingdom into isolated points without connectivity. Once these cuts were made, villages naturally grouped into clusters, each cluster linked together without any broken paths between them. Bob was intrigued by the power of multiplication, and he asked the challengers to consider the sizes of these clusters: multiplying the number of villages in each cluster to find a mystical product. The greater this product, the more prosperous and harmonious the kingdom\u2019s disrupted clusters could become in balance and influence.\n\nYour task, as a wise traveler, is to find the grandest product of cluster sizes achievable by cutting the pathways strategically. Each cluster's size is simply the count of villages joined snugly together after some set of breaks are made in the network. The challenge is to maximize this product, capturing the highest possible power that can be manifested by the clusters in their combined strength. You must consider all possible ways to sever the pathways\u2014they are given to you in a list, where each pair of villages connected by a path is noted. To gain your map, the first line reveals how many villages stand in Postalia's tree. Then, on each following line, you learn which two villages share a pathway, describing the tree's elegant structure. Remember, the truth of the network's shape assures that the connectivity has no loops.\n\nWhen you solve the problem, your answer is a single grand number: the highest product of the sizes of the cluster groups that can be conjured following the rules. This number tells the tale of how to break or keep the wonderful connections for the most potent arrangement of villages.\n\nFor example, among a kingdom with five villages aligned on a straight path, severing one pathway cleverly can yield clusters of sizes two and three, whose product of sizes gives you six\u2014a magical moment of balance for the villagers. In another tale, with eight villages arranged with a branching tree, cutting certain pathways can raise the product to eighteen, showcasing the kingdom\u2019s power through harmonious clusters. And in a simple realm with just three villages connected in a star-like shape, the best you can do gives a product of three, when all are kept united or partitioned accordingly. Thus, the puzzle unfolds: how will you break or keep the paths to weave the strongest tapestry of clusters in Postalia\u2019s enchanted Tree?\n\n### Coding Test format:\nRecently Bob invented a new game with a tree (we should remind you, that a tree is a connected graph without cycles): he deletes any (possibly, zero) amount of edges of the tree, and counts the product of sizes of the connected components left after the deletion. Your task is to find out the maximum number that Bob can get in his new game for a given tree.\n\nInput Format\nThe first input line contains integer number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 700) \u2014 amount of vertices in the tree. The following n - 1 lines contain the description of the edges. Each line contains the pair of vertices' indexes, joined by an edge, ai, bi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 n). It's guaranteed that the graph described in the input is a tree.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput the only number \u2014 the maximum product of sizes of the connected components, that Bob can get after deleting some of the tree's edges.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n\nSample Output 1\n\n6\n\nSample Input 2\n\n8\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 6\n3 7\n6 8\n\nSample Output 2\n\n18\n\nSample Input 3\n\n3\n1 2\n1 3\n\nSample Output 3\n\n3",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn a bustling kingdom known for its arcane codes and mysterious scripts, there existed a legendary inn famed beyond all borders\u2014the Inn of Enigmatic Commands. The inn was no ordinary tavern; its ledger was scribed with the secrets of an ancient script known only as the HQ dialect, a mystical subset of the greater HQ9+ language. This script was celebrated for its four sacred runes, though our tale will focus on only two: the *H* rune and the *Q* rune. Scribes from far and wide brought scrolls inscribed with sequences of these runes, eager to uncover the magic hidden within the patterns.\n\nThe rules of this mystical language were as peculiar as they were strict. The innkeeper, a wise old mage, had decreed that a scroll's sequence would be deemed \u201cYes,\u201d meaning worthy and complete, only if it balanced the presence of the two sacred runes according to ancient communal customs. The inn\u2019s code held that the *H* rune, symbolic of hearty welcomes, should be the most frequent character encountered, while the *Q* rune represented the curious questions asked by travelers, allowed only in pairs that reinforced the harmony of the script. If the sequence followed this balanced dance\u2014where the number of *Q* runes tagged along in balanced pairs without overwhelming the hearty *H*s\u2014the inn\u2019s magic would affirm the scroll's authenticity. Otherwise, the scroll would be cast aside with a solemn \u201cNo,\u201d marking it incomplete or discordant.\n\nThe challenge for the scribes was straightforward yet profound: present a line of runes, containing only the sacred symbols *H* and *Q*, anywhere from a single rune to a sprawling sequence of up to one million runes long. Upon reading this sequence, the innkeeper\u2019s enchanted ledger would whisper back a single verdict\u2014either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d The scribes had to ensure that their script respected the inn\u2019s social harmony rules, by arranging their lines so that the *Q* runes appeared exactly in pairs, synchronizing perfectly with the rhythms of the *H*s. If the balance was struck, the scroll\u2019s journey would continue; if not, the message of the inn would be to reject the offering.\n\nTo clarify their mystical process, the scribes shared their findings with the wider guild. When a sequence of only *H* runes filled a scroll, such as four hearty welcomes in a row, the innkeeper gladly proclaimed \u201cYes,\u201d for no imbalance disturbed the peace. When the pattern mixed *H* and *Q* runes improperly, such as in a line where single *Q* runes appeared or pairs were mismatched, the answer was \u201cNo,\u201d signaling disturbance in the sacred order. Intriguingly, longer scrolls with clustered pairs of *Q* runes flanked by sturdy blocks of *H*s passed the trial. The innkeeper\u2019s ledger thus became a measure of balanced expression, where harmony between hearty welcomes and pairs of inquiries was the ultimate criterion.\n\nHere stand some records from the guild: one scroll bore four *H* runes in steady sequence and was greeted with a resounding \u201cYes.\u201d Another bore *H*, *Q*, *H*, *Q*, *H* in a mixed but unbalanced pattern, and was met with \u201cNo.\u201d A longer, complex scroll of alternating runes without consistent pairings also fell short, receiving \u201cNo.\u201d Yet a final, elaborate parchment with two pairs of *Q*s nestled neatly among *H*s won the innkeeper\u2019s blessing and \u201cYes\u201d was inscribed on its page.\n\nThus, the legacy of the Inn of Enigmatic Commands endures\u2014the scribes forever seek to weave rune-lined depictions not merely to exist, but to thrive within the mystical harmony of *H* and paired *Q* runes. Their art is not just to meet the ancient law, but to honor it fully, crafting sequences so perfectly balanced that the inn\u2019s magic will forever chant \u201cYes\u201d to their worthy offerings.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nThe famous joke programming language HQ9+ has only 4 commands.

        "question_title": "Close Vertices",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the sprawling digital realm of NexaSphere, an elite e-sports tournament named \u201cThe Arboreal Clash\u201d unfolds. This competition isn\u2019t about mere reflexes or strategy alone\u2014players control unique nodes, called Vertices, connected by digital tunnels known as Edges. Each connection carries a certain Data Weight, representing the difficulty or cost of traversing it. In this grand championship, there are many Vertices competing, numbering as many as a hundred thousand, woven together in a grand, branching network that loops no more than once back to itself, like a mighty tree of influence.\n\nThe tournament's rules bind every connection with a non-negative difficulty score\u2014the weight\u2014that influences how players navigate from one Vertex to another. Each battle pairing depends not just on proximity in the network, but also on how *quickly* and *lightly* information can flow between the two points. Here, distance is measured by the minimum number of hops (edges) needed to traverse between two competitors, while strain is the sum of the weights along that path. Two Vertices are declared \u201cclose allies\u201d if there exists a route between them requiring no more hops than a given threshold and no more cumulative difficulty than another given limit. These limits\u2014l and w\u2014are finely tuned by the tournament architects, with the total number of Vertices, l (the maximum allowable hops between allies), and w (the maximum permitted cumulative weight) set as official parameters before the match begins.\n\nThe ultimate task for players who control this network is to count all unique pairs of Vertices whose paths conform to these constraints\u2014meaning that the path connecting them involves no more than l jumps, and carries no heavier burden than w units of data weight. This counting must be done precisely and efficiently to measure ally potential, as the players seek to identify or capitalize on strategic partnerships under these rules, ensuring every alliance respects the network's logic and weight restrictions. The official input to this processor: the total number of Vertices and the parameters l and w, followed by a list detailing each connection\u2019s pairing and weight, building the network from the ground up. The output is a single number\u2014the grand total of all such \u201cclose ally\u201d pairs as defined by the realm\u2019s metrics.\n\nFor instance, on a smaller digital map containing four Vertices with generous thresholds allowing four separate hops and total weights up to six, the tally of close ally pairs reaches four. These pairs emerge naturally as the nodes align within the constraints, even though each connection carries some data weight. Alternatively, a six-Vertex network, with a more restrictively swift connection limit of just two hops and a weight threshold capped at seventeen units, yields nine such alliances, counting every possible pair that stays inside the stringent bounds. Each input line after the initial parameters describes how the network branches out from an earlier numbered Vertex to the next, along with the weight of that edge.\n\nThus, the challenge set before the competitors in the Arboreal Clash is clear: given the expansive, weighted hierarchy of Vertices and their defining parameters from input, determine the number of pairs joined closely enough by the swift, light paths that the tournament\u2019s law allows. The output, a single integer number representing these closely bonded pairs, will declare who truly understands the vast, yet delicately balanced nexus of data that forms the tree of allies.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou've got a weighted tree, consisting of n vertices. Each edge has a non-negative weight. The length of the path between any two vertices of the tree is the number of edges in the path. The weight of the path is the total weight of all edges it contains.\n\nTwo vertices are close if there exists a path of length at most l between them and a path of weight at most w between them. Count the number of pairs of vertices v, u (v < u), such that vertices v and u are close.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains three integers n, l and w (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 w \u2264 109).

Each index in the list corresponds to a vertex, and the value at that index is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an edge connected to that vertex. The tuple contains the neighbor vertex and the weight of the edge.\n\n2. **Depth First Search (DFS):**\n   - The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search starting from a given node.\n   - It takes the following parameters:\n     - `node`: The current vertex being visited.\n     - `dist`: The current distance from the starting node.\n     - `weight`: The current weight accumulated along the path.\n     - `visited`: A list to keep track of visited vertices.\n   - The function iterates through the neighbors of the current node.\n   - For each neighbor:\n     - If the neighbor hasn't been visited and the current distance and weight are within the allowed limits (`dist + 1 <= l` and `weight + edge_weight <= w`), recursively call `dfs` on the neighbor.\n   - The function returns the number of close pairs found from the current node.\n\n3. **Counting Close Pairs:**\n   - Initialize `close_pairs` to 0.\n   - Iterate through each vertex from 1 to `n`.\n   - For each vertex, call `dfs` to explore all possible paths starting from that vertex.\n   - Add the number of close pairs found from each vertex to `close_pairs`.\n\n4. **Output:**\n   - Divide `close_pairs` by 2 to avoid double-counting pairs (since each pair is counted twice: once for each vertex).\n   - Print the final count of close pairs.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\n",

        "question_title": "Yaroslav and Divisors",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the grand courtroom of Numeria, presided over by the venerable Judge Yaroslav, a curious case was unfolding. Before the judge lay a grand ledger, a collection of unique gems, each inscribed with a distinct number, from the humblest servant's mark to the grandest noble's crest. There were a total of *N* such gems, no two alike, arranged in a strict procession from first to last, each with its own unique number no greater than the count of gems itself. Alongside, a series of *M* petitions had arrived, each asking for a detailed audit within specified stretches of the procession\u2014segments where the magistrates required insight into the intricate relationships of these numbered jewels.\n\nThe courtroom's scrolls dictated the rules of scrutiny: For any given petition, which named a start and end point along the line of gems, the challenge was to uncover the count of harmonious pairs. Harmony between two gems meant that the jewel nearer the beginning bore a number that flawlessly divided the number on the jewel nearer the end, much like a worthy vassal who perfectly serves his lord\u2019s command. Each pair was chosen only within that petition\u2019s specified bounds, capturing only gems from the declared beginning up to the declared end position, inclusive. Every petition bore the firm rule that the start was never ahead of the end, and both positions respected the boundaries of the entire procession.\n\nJudge Yaroslav, though wise, faced a daunting task\u2014to answer each petition efficiently and with precision for all *M* queries, given that the procession and number of requests could be vast, stretching into the hundreds of thousands. The goal was not merely to comply but to deliver the exact counts swiftly and clearly: the number of these noble-divisor pairs within each segment, accommodating the capricious demands of the court without error or delay. Each answer must be announced in the order the petitions arrived, preserving the integrity of the judicial process.\n\nThe court clerk, versed in the intricate laws, accepted the input in a formal decree: First, the total number of gems and petitions was inscribed on a clean parchment line. Next, the unique numbers on the gems were recited, setting the stage. Then, for each petition, the start and end positions along the row of gems were provided on their own line, laying out the bounds of each specific inquiry. The answers would flow forth as a sequence of numbers, each declaring the count of divisor pairs found in corresponding petitions, one answer per line.\n\nTo illustrate, in a simple case with a single gem and a single request spanning the entire row of one, the verdict was immediate: only one pair existed (the gem with itself), thus the answer was one. In a grander scenario of ten gems numbered in ascending order and nine petitions spanning various segments, the answers revealed the rich tapestry of divisibility relationships woven among gems \u2014 from twenty-seven pairs in the broadest sweep down to a solitary pair in a narrow span. Each decree of answers stood as testament to the careful reckonings of the court, reflecting the depth of harmony among the regal numbers in their procession.\n\nThus, under the watchful eye of Judge Yaroslav and the written laws of Numeria, the court\u2019s task was clear: for each query broad or narrow, count and declare with clarity the pairs where one gem\u2019s number stood as the divisor of another within the designated segment, ensuring justice and order in the realm of numbers.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYaroslav has an array p = p1, p2, ..., pn (1 \u2264 pi \u2264 n), consisting of n distinct integers. Also, he has m queries:\n\n- Query number i is represented as a pair of integers li, ri (1 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264 n).\n- The answer to the query li, ri is the number of pairs of integers q, w (li \u2264 q, w \u2264 ri) such that pq is the divisor of pw.\n\nHelp Yaroslav, answer all his queries.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains the integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 2\u00b7105). The second line contains n distinct integers p1, p2, ..., pn (1 \u2264 pi \u2264 n). The following m lines contain Yaroslav's queries. The i-th line contains integers li, ri (1 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264 n).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint m integers \u2014 the answers to Yaroslav's queries in the order they appear in the input.\n\nPlease, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n1 1\n1\n1 1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\n\nSample Input 2\n\n10 9\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n1 10\n2 9\n3 8\n4 7\n5 6\n2 2\n9 10\n5 10\n4 10\n\nSample Output 2\n\n27\n14\n8\n4\n2\n1\n2\n7\n9",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\n**Post-Apocalyptic Survival Log: The Modular Enigma**\n\nIn the shattered remnants of what was once a thriving civilization, survivors have unearthed a peculiar puzzle etched into the ruins of an ancient vault. The vault\u2019s locks are governed not by physical keys, but by the alignment of mysterious numbers each carved on weathered stones scattered across the wasteland. These numbers represent unique energies, and the vault\u2019s mechanism demands a secret harmony\u2014or rather, a specific form of disharmony. To ensure secrets remain safe, survivors discovered that no two energies should resonate identically when filtered through a foundational pulse of the land, a number that governs the energetic harmony. This pulse must be carefully chosen\u2014too small or flawed, and energies might clash, unlocking chaos rather than safety.\n\nThe survivor group has gathered a collection of distinct energy stones, their count documented\u2014somewhere between a few and a few thousand relics, but never exceeding the manageable thousands. Among these stones, each bears a unique signature energy ranging from none to a million units. However, the harsh conditions mean only a few\u2014no more than four\u2014among these stones can be sacrificed to ensure the vault\u2019s encryption principle is satisfied. This rule, etched into ancient scripts, demands that when the pulse is applied, no two stones should share the same echo or remainder, a form of numerical uniqueness vital for stability.\n\nThe survivors\u2019 mission is clear: they must identify the smallest positive pulse of energy that, when applied to the remaining stones (after possibly discarding some few), guarantees that no two stones produce the same echo. Echoes here signify the remainder once the energy of a stone is divided by this governing pulse. To clarify, the group receives two numbers first\u2014the count of stones they hold and the maximum sacrifices allowed. Then, on the next line, the exact unique energies of their stones are listed plainly. Their challenge echoes across their calculations: find the smallest pulse greater than zero so that after sacrificing up to the allowed few stones, no two stones resonate the same echo.\n\nFor instance, consider a gathering of seven stones, among which no sacrifices are allowed. Their energies stand as zero, two, three, six, seven, twelve, and eighteen. The survivors find that choosing a pulse of thirteen units keeps every stone\u2019s echo unique\u2014they test lower pulses but encounter clashes, so thirteen is their minimal guardian. On another day, with the exact stones but one sacrifice permitted, they tweak and prune their energies just slightly, and discover that a pulse of seven units suffices, maintaining the harmony with their adjusted set.\n\nThus, the survivors\u2019 fate depends on deducing this minimal pulse, balancing sacrifice and harmony, to unlock the vault of ancient secrets. Their input logs begin with the count of stones and permitted sacrifices, followed by the energies listed in a single line. Their output, simple and stark, confirms the smallest positive pulse that seals their safety and finds the vault\u2019s hidden truth.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou have been given n distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nOn the sprawling island of Numeria, a curious tribe faced a challenge known as the Board of Balance. The island's mystical council, led by the clever Fox Ciel, gathered around a vast square map etched into stone, divided into an odd number of rows and columns\u2014say, a number that no wanderer dared call even, but instead always counted as one more than an even number, then halved and rounded up to find that special middle measure, the heart of the board. This middle measure, which the islanders called the Center Span, shaped the island\u2019s fate and all council decisions.\n\nThe council had a sacred ritual: they could select any square sub-map, exactly as large as the Center Span in both dimensions, and invoke a spell that flipped the fortunes\u2014every number within that chosen patch would be multiplied by minus one, changing fortunes from gains to losses or vice versa. This was their way to mend the land, to turn the tides of misfortune to prosperity. But the magic wasn\u2019t random \u2014 only these centered-sized squares could be flipped, and many times if needed. The key was to find how to weave these flips to bring forth the greatest possible prosperity \u2014 that is, the largest sum of all numbers on the stone map after countless such transformations.\n\nThe challenge before Fox Ciel was clear: given that the island\u2019s map was carved as a grid with this odd-sized dimension\u2014the number of rows and columns no larger than a few tens\u2014and filled with fortunes both bright and dim, each constrained by limits no greater than a thousand\u2019s reach in either direction, she must determine the highest bounty attainable by applying the flips any number of times to any chosen Center Span-square patch. Fox Ciel needed to communicate this to her tribe, making sure they understood that the goal was not merely to survive, but to thrive as much as the rules permitted, flipping wisely to maximize the whole board\u2019s treasure sum.\n\nThe toll of input to this council\u2019s problem came as follows: first, the grand size of the board\u2014a lone number signaling the odd dimension of the island\u2019s map. Then, on each of the following lines equal in count to the size of the map, the fortunes carved into each cell were told aloud, each line bearing the precise values for that row of the map. As for the answer, the council sought just one number\u2014a single integer, delivered with confidence, reflecting the greatest sum of fortunes that could be wrought by these sacred flips.\n\nTo illustrate, in one tale of a small island of three by three, the fortunes were mixed with bad and good in a certain pattern. By flipping two specific 2-by-2 patches\u2014the upper left and then the lower right\u2014Fox Ciel transformed every negative shadow into a bright positive gleam, culminating in a total bounty of nine, the highest the island could hope for given its pattern. On a larger, more complex island of five by five, with fortunes scattered similarly and centered around negative twos and zeros like ocean waves, careful flipping of these Center Span patches yielded a stunning total bounty of eighteen, a treasure beyond all initial sight.\n\nThus, the council\u2019s saga ends with Fox Ciel and her islanders empowered to decode any map of odd measure, wield the ancient flips with perfect strategy, and reveal to their people the greatest prosperity hidden within their mystical Board of Balance.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nFox Ciel has a board with n rows and n columns, there is one integer in each cell.\n\nIt's known that n is an odd number, so let's introduce x = \\frac{n+1}{2}. Fox Ciel can do the following operation many times: she choose a sub-board with size x rows and x columns, then all numbers in it will be multiplied by -1.\n\nReturn the maximal sum of numbers in the board that she can get by these operations.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains an integer n, (1 \u2264 n \u2264 33, and n is an odd integer) \u2014 the size of the board.\n\nEach of the next n lines contains n integers \u2014 the numbers in the board. Each number doesn't exceed 1000 by its absolute value.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput a single integer: the maximal sum of numbers in the board that can be accomplished.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n-1 -1 1\n-1 1 -1\n1 -1 -1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n9\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5\n-2 0 0 0 -2\n0 -2 0 -2 0\n0 0 -2 0 0\n0 -2 0 -2 0\n-2 0 0 0 -2\n\nSample Output 2\n\n18\n\nNote\nIn the first test, we can apply this operation twice: first on the top left 2 x 2 sub-board, then on the bottom right 2 x 2 sub-board. Then all numbers will become positive.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nWelcome to another midnight archive broadcast from the ethereal waves of the Computational Twilight\u2014a realm where puzzles are cloaked in enigma and every algorithm sings a hidden song. Tonight, we dive into a tale of Manao, a methodical architect of logic struggling with the clock\u2019s relentless march. Manao has crafted a blueprint to solve a grand enigma, but whispers among the cosmic circuits reveal his approach, though sound, crawls too slowly through time\u2019s river.\n\nIn the world Manao inhabits, there is a sequence of mystical tokens laid out in a long chain\u2014imagine a string of *N* ancient runes, each gleaming with a distinct strength. From this great string, he needs to extract a smaller pattern of *L* runes, each bearing a unique required power signature. Above all, there is a threshold\u2014call it the \u2018height of endurance\u2019 *H*\u2014which no rune examined in this hidden pattern can surpass. Manao\u2019s challenge: to find the greatest number of starting points in the great chain where this pattern can fit perfectly, respecting the height rule on each rune\u2019s strength after a subtle transformation.\n\nTo understand Manao\u2019s puzzle, envision he takes each selected rune\u2019s power and adds the power of the corresponding rune in his pattern. This sum must never overreach the sacred height *H*. The grand string is all laid out for us, as are the values of the pattern\u2014both sequences known to us with lengths and strengths each bounded by the giant numbers of the realm (up to one hundred and fifty thousand runes, their strengths reaching near a billion). Manao\u2019s goal is to count just how many times this pattern can fit onto the great chain so that when combining their powers, the sum at each position remains within endurance.\n\nOur task, dear listeners, is to assist Manao not just in solving but in doing so with swift clarity \u2014 to refine his ancient incantation into a form that does not falter with length or power\u2019s magnitude. The input of our broadcast unfolds as three lines: the first hums with the lengths *N*, *L*, and the endurance *H*; the second strings together the powers of the pattern\u2019s runes; and the third, the vast sequence\u2019s power array. The output, demanded by the cosmic archivists, is a single number\u2014how many such fitting places exist.\n\nFor illustration, imagine *N* as five runes, *L* as two, and *H* as ten. The hidden pattern is given with power weights five and three, the great chain reveals powers of one, eight, five, five, and seven. The question posed: how many positions can the pairings be made such that the sum of the corresponding powers never oversteps the endurance? The answer, echoing across the airwaves, is two. Twice the pattern nestles in perfectly: the summations align under ten, twice over the stretch of five runes.\n\nThus closes tonight\u2019s transmission: the quest to craft swifter logic in Manao\u2019s unfolding saga\u2014a tale where numbers dance and patterns fit, not just correctly, but with all the speed the midnight realm demands. Tune in again as we uncover more enigmas, and remember\u2014the beauty lies not only in the answer but the journey through the thread of thought itself.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nManao is solving a problem with the following statement:\n\nHe came up with a solution that produces the correct answers but is too slow. You are given the pseudocode of his solution, where the function getAnswer calculates the answer to the problem:\n\nYour task is to help Manao optimize his algorithm.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains space-separated integers n, len and h (1 \u2264 len \u2264 n \u2264 150000;\u00a01 \u2264 h \u2264 109).

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the bustling metropolis of Eventeria, master designers are famed for orchestrating the flow of enormous spectacles. At the heart of their craft lies a mesmerizing sequence of ceremonial steps\u2014each step tied to enchanting numbers whispered from ancient scrolls. The head designer is given a collection of special \"rhythmic patterns,\" each defined by a unique positive integer. These patterns govern how the tempo of the grand performance might be gracefully altered. Each spectacle begins at a majestic number indicating the initial pulse of the event, from which the designer must skillfully ease the rhythm into a desired, softer finale number. Both these pulses rest within the range that the great library records as manageable, no more than around a billion beats, but with the delicate difference between the starting and ending beats never exceeding just over a million, ensuring the transition is not overwhelmingly vast.\n\nThe rules of transformation in Eventeria's rhythm-mastery are simple yet profound. At any moment, the designer may reduce the current pulse by exactly one beat to gently slow the tempo. However, a deeper magic allows a grander leap: they can select any one of the given rhythmic patterns and reduce the current pulse by the exact remainder left when dividing the pulse by that pattern\u2019s number\u2014a move that swiftly shifts the rhythm by shedding the extra \"fragment\" beats clinging to the current tempo. These rhythmic subtraction spells can be cast repeatedly, in any order, allowing the designer a wide array of transitions to move from the booming start to the peaceful rest. The challenge is to accomplish this transition in as few moves as possible, harnessing both the subtle and potent reductions to guide the tempo elegantly downward.\n\nGiven this setting, the designer must calculate the minimum number of enchanting moves required to transform the initial pulse into the finale pulse following these sacred rituals. The design begins by taking in the count of rhythmic patterns inscribed, followed by the full list of these powerful numbers, each at least two and potentially reaching into the billions. Next, the initial and final pulses are accepted, each no smaller than zero and held between the bounds of the grandest performances recorded. The output should reveal a single, pure number: the least count of moves that masterfully usher the event\u2019s pulse from its grand origin to its serene conclusion.\n\nConsider the first grand spectacle, where three rhythmic patterns are provided: three, four, and five beats. The pulse starts powering at thirty beats and must gently descend to seventeen. By cunningly weaving between simple single-beat slowdowns and sudden drops dictated by the remainder moves, the master designer finds a pathway that only demands six moves, a dance balanced perfectly between patience and power. In another grand event, with patterns five, six, and seven echoing through the arena and the starting pulse vibrating at one thousand, to be tamed to two hundred, the intricate choreography requires two hundred and six moves\u2014each harmonizing to carve a steady descent within the limits of ancient rules.\n\nThus, in the realm of Eventeria, the true artistry lies not only in meeting the rhythm\u2019s end but in conquering the passage with striking efficiency, weaving between small steps and grand leaps as the festival's pulse fades into history.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a sequence of positive integers x1, x2, ..., xn and two non-negative integers a and b.

        "question_title": "Pair of Numbers",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the grand halls of the Arcane Academy, amidst the swirling mists of ancient knowledge, a peculiar challenge was laid before the apprentices during the Examination of Insight. The headmaster Simon, a sage known for his enigmatic puzzles, presented a collection of enchanted runes arranged in a linear procession on a magical tableau. Each rune radiated with a unique power, represented by a positive numeric essence. The apprentices\u2019 task was to unravel the hidden harmony among these consecutively aligned runes, whose lengths could span up to three hundred thousand units, and whose powers might reach into the realm of one million.\n\nThe rules of the challenge were strict yet subtle. The apprentices must select a continuous stretch of runes\u2014beginning at some point and ending at another further along the sequence, never stepping outside the tableau\u2019s bounds. Within that uninterrupted segment, there must exist a single rune whose power acts as a key. This key rune\u2019s magic must be such that every other rune in the selected segment bows to it perfectly, their powers divisible by the key\u2019s essence without remainder. Moreover, the segment chosen should be as long as possible under this demand, maximizing the span from start to end. And if multiple such segments rivaled each other in maximum length, the apprentices were to recognize all of these equally worthy intervals.\n\nTo meet the headmaster\u2019s challenge, one first learns how to take stock: the number of runes arrayed is whispered on the first parchment line, while the powers of each rune in sequence are inscribed on the next. The solution demands a reply as well: on one scroll, the total count of the grandest segments and their length difference (how many steps lie between the start and end runes) are to be recorded. On the subsequent scroll, the starting positions of these esteemed segments must be chronicled in ascending order, revealing the path to the longest harmony.\n\nFor example, consider a set of five runes. Their powers read as four, six, nine, three, and six. Here, the chosen harmony emerges from the runes starting at position two through to position five, where the rune of power three serves the key. Each rune within this span willingly yields to that power\u2019s magic, and no longer segment can boast such a harmonious master. Thus, just one segment graces the answer, stretching over three steps, starting solemnly at rune two.\n\nIn another test, a quintet of runes bears the powers one, three, five, seven, and nine. The simplest rune, with power one, is the universal master, as all others submit evenly to its whim. The longest melodic stretch spans from the first rune through the fifth, covering four steps. Hence, only a single greatness emerges here as well, beginning at rune one.\n\nYet in a third case where the five runes possess prime powers two, three, five, seven, and eleven, no rune except itself can govern without remainder, forcing the apprentices to consider each rune alone in solitude. This yields five dignified segments of length zero, each beginning at every single rune in turn.\n\nThus the Arcane Academy\u2019s challenge remains: discern the longest sequence bound by a unifying rune, enumerate all such sequences, and proclaim their origins. The exam is not just to meet the conditions but to unveil the full extent of their might, to master the art of harmony among the arcane runes.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nSimon has an array a1, a2, ..., an, consisting of n positive integers. Today Simon asked you to find a pair of integers l, r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n), such that the following conditions hold:\n\n1. there is integer j (l \u2264 j \u2264 r), such that all integers al, al + 1, ..., ar are divisible by aj;\n2. value r - l takes the maximum value among all pairs for which condition 1 is true;\n\nHelp Simon, find the required pair of numbers (l, r).

        "question_title": "Empty Rectangles",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the industrious realm of Automatara, the grand Toy Factory stretches far and wide, shaped like a vast grid made of countless tiny workbenches arranged neatly in rows and columns. Each workbench holds a small tile, and this tile glows either with the shadow of a \u201csilent switch\u201d or a \u201csparkling switch,\u201d symbolized by a dark mark or a bright spark respectively. The factory overseers desire to understand the magical patterns hidden within these glowing tiles. Their fascination focuses on rectangular segments crafted from these contiguous workbenches, whose edges align perfectly along the borders of the individual benches\u2014never crooked or askew\u2014spanning various sizes and shapes within the grand grid.\n\nThe rules of the land declare that the grid\u2019s height and width can be as vast as thousands of benches, but not sprawling beyond this bound, ensuring the puzzle remains intricate yet bounded. Among these rectangles, the overseers seek those that contain exactly a certain number of sparkling switches\u2014never more than a few, never less than zero\u2014embedded within their boundaries. These sparkling switches, vital for operation, must total precisely the count decreed by the overseers\u2019 query, a number as modest as a handful at most. Thus, only rectangles with exactly this count of bright sparks are worthy of attention, as they represent segments perfectly energized for the next phase of crafting or analysis.\n\nTo uncover these special rectangles, the factory receives a detailed declaration each cycle: the vast dimensions of the grid\u2014the height as a count of rows and the width as columns\u2014followed by the magical number of sparkling switches desired within the rectangle. Then, the entirety of the grid is presented line by line, each line a sequence of quiet shadows and bright sparks written in their unique code. Each character in these sequences corresponds exactly to the tile\u2019s glow on a specific workbench\u2014the one located in a distinct row and column facing each other in this great hall of machines.\n\nThe grand quest for the overseers is to discover how many distinct rectangular patches of workbenches meet this criterion of sparkling balance. Each rectangle\u2019s edges must align to the workbench grid\u2019s borders, counting precisely the foretold number of ignitions. The result\u2014one single number\u2014reveals how many such perfectly illuminated rectangles exist in the factory that day, guiding production strategies and enchanting future blueprints.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a modest grid three benches square, where two bright sparks are desired. The overseers find eight glowing rectangles matching their wish. In a far larger five-by-five expanse seeking just one spark, an abundant eighty-one such glowing segments appear, shining with promise. And when they ask for half a dozen sparks, they discover a dozen rare, intricately glowing patches within the checkerboard of light and shadow. Even when the quest commands zero sparks, they find hundreds of silent rectangular sanctuaries waiting quietly within the glow and the dark. Through these counts, the Toy Factory of Automatara unveils its hidden luminous symphonies, perfectly framing plans for the wonders yet to come.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou've got an n x m table (n rows and m columns), each cell of the table contains a \"0\" or a \"1\".\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of rectangles with the sides that are parallel to the sides of the table and go along the cell borders, such that the number one occurs exactly k times in the rectangle.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 2500, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 6) \u2014 the sizes of the table and the required number of numbers one.\n\nNext n lines each contains m characters \"0\" or \"1\". The i-th character of the j-th line corresponds to the character that is in the j-th row and the i-th column of the table.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint a single number \u2014 the number of rectangles that contain exactly k numbers one.\n\nPlease, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 3 2\n101\n000\n101\n\nSample Output 1\n\n8\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5 5 1\n00000\n00000\n00100\n00000\n00000\n\nSample Output 2\n\n81\n\nSample Input 3\n\n5 5 6\n01010\n10101\n01010\n10101\n01010\n\nSample Output 3\n\n12\n\nSample Input 4\n\n3 3 0\n001\n010\n000\n\nSample Output 4\n\n15\n\nSample Input 5\n\n4 4 0\n0000\n0101\n0000\n0000\n\nSample Output 5\n\n52",

        "question_title": "Sereja and Brackets",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the enchanted realm of Sweetoria, there exists the legendary Magical Candy Factory, where confectioners craft extraordinary treats from sequences of magical brackets \u2014 delicate swirls shaped like the embracing curves of parentheses. This magic is controlled by the master confectioner named Sereja, who oversees a grand sequence of these enchanted brackets stretching out like a jeweled necklace. Each bracket is either an open swirl, curling gently like a blossoming flower (think of it as an \u201cembrace\u201d), or a close swirl, folding softly like a delicate leaf returning to rest. The length of this candy sequence is vast, sometimes reaching an astronomical number of bracket charms, as many as a million in a single line.\n\nIn Sweetoria, the true magic lies in crafting \u201ccorrect\u201d candy sequences \u2014 harmonious arrangements where every open swirl perfectly pairs with a close swirl, forming impeccable bracket pairs like twinkling duos of candy stars. But the factory\u2019s craft is not just about wholes; sometimes it\u2019s about the sweetest possible segments of these candies, chosen not in one continuous strip, but picked selectively yet in order, to yield the longest balanced pairings in a subset of the entire spellbinding chromatic string. Sereja's realm imposes a challenge of multiple quests. Each quest describes a segment of the candy strand \u2014 a starting bead and an ending bead along the endless garland \u2014 and the task is to reveal the most delightful and balanced candy subsequence within that span, one whose pairs fully dance in unity, leaving no stray swirls apart.\n\nSereja invites her apprentices to assist. They receive the legendary candy chain first, an unbroken line of open and close brackets in magical script filling a single page. Next, they learn the number of quests they must face, a large yet manageable number, no more than a hundred thousand, each demanding its own answer. For each quest, the apprentices discover two numbers describing the precise slice of the candy thread they must inspect \u2014 the start bead number and the end bead number, numbers humming softly between one and the length of the candy chain, where the start never outpaces the end. Their ultimate mission: To conjure, for each spell segment, the maximum length of a beautifully paired bracket subsequence, summoning the greatest harmony and balance the candy sequence can offer within that range.\n\nFor example, consider a candy string woven as \u201c())(())(())(\u201c. The magic asks about 7 quests. The first looks at just the very first candy bead alone, which cannot form any balanced duo \u2014 hence zero magic pairs. The second examines the second and third beads, but again, no enchanted pairs emerge. Yet the third quest, spanning the first two beads, reveals a charming pair forming a perfect \u201c()\u201d. The fourth quest, boldly embracing the entire string across twelve beads, uncorks a resplendent dance of ten perfectly matched swirls. The fifth looks near the end, finding four in magical balance, and the sixth and seventh quests unveil six perfect pairs within their own lengths. Each answer springs forth on its own line like a sparkling gem, marking the success of Sereja\u2019s apprentices.\n\nThus, in the Magical Candy Factory of Sweetoria, the art of unearthing the longest harmonious subsequence of bracketed sweets from a section of the enchanted chain is not merely about recognizing pairs \u2014 it\u2019s about mastering the greatest possible harmony, ensuring every open swirl finds its close, crafting sweet balanced melodies under the watchful eyes of the master confectioner Sereja, who treasures such magic above all else.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nSereja has a bracket sequence s1, s2, ..., sn, or, in other words, a string s of length n, consisting of characters \"(\" and \")\".\n\nSereja needs to answer m queries, each of them is described by two integers li, ri (1 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264 n). The answer to the i-th query is the length of the maximum correct bracket subsequence of sequence sli, sli + 1, ..., sri. Help Sereja answer all queries.\n\nYou can find the definitions for a subsequence and a correct bracket sequence in the notes.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a sequence of characters s1, s2, ..., sn (1 \u2264 n \u2264 106) without any spaces. Each character is either a \"(\" or a \")\". The second line contains integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 105) \u2014 the number of queries. Each of the next m lines contains a pair of integers. The i-th line contains integers li, ri (1 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264 n) \u2014 the description of the i-th query.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the answer to each question on a single line. Print the answers in the order they go in the input.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n())(())(())(\n7\n1 1\n2 3\n1 2\n1 12\n8 12\n5 11\n2 10\n\nSample Output 1\n\n0\n0\n2\n10\n4\n6\n6\n\nNote\nA subsequence of length |x| of string s = s1s2... s|s| (where |s| is the length of string s) is string x = sk1sk2... sk|x| (1 \u2264 k1 < k2 < ... < k|x| \u2264 |s|).\n\nA correct bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct aryphmetic expression by inserting characters \"1\" and \"+\" between the characters of the string. For example, bracket sequences \"()()\", \"(())\" are correct (the resulting expressions \"(1)+(1)\", \"((1+1)+1)\"), and \")(\" and \"(\" are not.\n\nFor the third query required sequence will be \u00ab()\u00bb.\n\nFor the fourth query required sequence will be \u00ab()(())(())\u00bb.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn a vast, ancient mansion shrouded in mist and mystery, a peculiar puzzle challenges those who dare enter its labyrinthine halls. This mansion is segmented into numbered rooms along a grand corridor, starting from the first chamber all the way to the one bearing the largest number, say N, a number no greater than a thousand. Explorers seek to uncover the secret sequence of room pairs, each pair representing a chamber interval.\n\nThere are whispers that an enchanted sequence of these room pairs is called \"beautiful\" by the mansion's eternal guardian. To be deemed so, the pairs must follow a strict order of discovery along the corridor: for each consecutive pair, the starting room number never falls behind the previous pair's ending room; the ending rooms themselves ascend steadily without overlap; and most intriguing of all, the \u201clength\u201d of each pair \u2014 the count of rooms from start to end \u2014 must be uniquely different for every pair. No two pairs in the sequence share an equal room-span, and all pairs fit perfectly within the mansion's corridor, never exceeding the grand chamber N.\n\nThe challenge before any seeker is this: given the mansion\u2019s size and the number of pairs the sequence must contain, determine how many such beautiful sequences exist. The grand chamber number and the count of pairs are provided as input from the mansion\u2019s oracle, who offers T tests, each revealing a pair of values \u2014 the mansion's total rooms and the sequence's required length \u2014 one test per line after the initial count of tests. For each test, the seeker must calculate and reveal the count of possible beautiful sequences, but beware \u2014 the tally can grow astronomically large, so it must be declared modulo the ancient prime 1,000,000,007, ensuring the answer remains within manageable bounds.\n\nTo interpret the oracle\u2019s commands: the first whisper tells how many tests there are, up to two hundred thousand challenges. Then follow the lines, each revealing the mansion\u2019s size and the number of pairs to be placed inside the corridor\u2019s order. For each question, the answer must be delivered plainly, one after another, one per line, preserving their order as given by the oracle.\n\nFor example, when the mansion is but a single room and the sequence demands just one pair, only one beautiful sequence can exist: the pair that starts and ends in that single room. When the grand corridor extends to two rooms and only one pair is needed, three such sequences emerge\u2014pairs that cover just the first room, both rooms, or just the second room. Yet, puzzles become unsolvable when the quest asks for more pairs than unique room sizes allow, as with certain combinations that yield no beautiful sequences at all. Sometimes, with a slightly larger mansion, such as three rooms, the number of beautiful sequences blooms again, revealing fascinating patterns for pairs of length two, but shrinks to zero once demands exceed spatial possibilities.\n\nThus, armed with these rules and tales, the seeker crafts the counts for their input set, delivering answers that dance within the mansion\u2019s arcane logic\u2014a perfect harmony of ordered pairs and unique strides down the corridor of chambers, painting a mysterious numeric tapestry woven from the mansion\u2019s very walls.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nThe sequence of integer pairs (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (ak, bk) is beautiful, if the following statements are fulfilled:\n\n- 1 \u2264 a1 \u2264 b1 < a2 \u2264 b2 < ... < ak \u2264 bk \u2264 n, where n is a given positive integer;\n- all numbers b1 - a1, b2 - a2, ..., bk - ak are distinct.\n\nFor the given number n find the number of beautiful sequences of length k. As the answer can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing it by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of the test data.\n\nEach of the next t lines contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 1000).\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test from the input print the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7). Print the answers to the tests in the order in which the tests are given in the input.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n6\n1 1\n2 1\n2 2\n3 1\n3 2\n3 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\n3\n0\n6\n2\n0\n\nNote\nIn the first test sample there is exactly one beautiful sequence: (1, 1).\n\nIn the second test sample, the following sequences are beautiful:\n\n- (1, 1);\n- (1, 2);\n- (2, 2).\n\nIn the fourth test sample, the following sequences are beautiful:\n\n- (1, 1);\n- (1, 2);\n- (1, 3);\n- (2, 2);\n- (2, 3);\n- (3, 3).\n\nIn the fifth test sample, the following sequences are beautiful:\n\n- (1, 1), (2, 3);\n- (1, 2), (3, 3).\n\nIn the third and sixth samples, there are no beautiful sequences.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome to the Grand Central of Geometry, where every day the Station Master announces the mysterious dance of points across an invisible grid. Today, we recount an intriguing puzzle involving the painted points scattered on the vast plane beneath our rails \u2014 points carefully marked by the artist Sereja, each resting precisely on a unique integer coordinate.\n\nHere\u2019s the scenario: imagine a grand map, paved with integer crossings \u2014 whole number avenues and streets \u2014 stretching far and wide up to a limit akin to the station\u2019s own vast expanse, no more than one hundred thousand marks along either axis. Sereja\u2019s artwork consists of a collection of these unique points, each sitting boldly at its own distinct intersection. Now, the challenge that grips the station is to discover how many perfect squares can be found among these points, where every corner of the square must be exactly where a painted point lies, and, crucially, the square itself aligns perfectly with the station\u2019s grid \u2014 that is, its sides run directly north-south and east-west, no tilting allowed.\n\nThe kerfuffle is this: given the number of painted points (denoted by a count that won't exceed one hundred thousand) and the detailed list of their locations \u2014 each engraved with two whole numbers indicating their position along the east and north directions \u2014 we must determine the total count of these ideal squares. Our goal isn't merely to confirm their existence, but to tally all such \"gridline\" squares that can be formed using any four of these points as vertices, making sure none are overlooked.\n\nNow, picture the input process as a travelers\u2019 ledger: on the first line arrives the declaration of how many unique points are on the map. Following that, each of the next lines entries two numbers \u2014 the eastward coordinate and the northward coordinate \u2014 representing a single point\u2019s precise location. For output, the station master expects a single declaration on a line by itself: the number of perfect coordinate-aligned squares stamped by these points.\n\nTo illustrate with an example, consider the first announcement: five points spot the station territory at coordinates like southwest corner, northeast corner, and a singular point in the center. Here, the sharp-eyed observer notices exactly one perfect square, formed by four points at the locations (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), and (2,2). In a more bustling scenario, nine points populate the map, and here, the tally of these perfect squares rises impressively to five, as every suitable quartet of points forms such a square neatly aligned to the grid.\n\nThus, dear travelers, as you visualize these painted marks scattered on our infinite grid railway, imagine the delicate task of uncovering every square-shaped car that might be formed along these tracks \u2014 a puzzle as orderly, precise, and elegant as the finest train schedule. Your mission, if accepted, is to count these quadrilateral gems and announce to the world how many perfect squares lie in wait among the millions of grid points. Safe travels across the geometric plains!\n\n### Coding Test format:\nSereja has painted n distinct points on the plane. The coordinates of each point are integers. Now he is wondering: how many squares are there with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with points painted in all its four vertexes? Help him, calculate this number.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105). Each of the next n lines contains two integers xi, yi (0 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 105), the integers represent the coordinates of the i-th point. It is guaranteed that all the given points are distinct.\n\nOutput Format\nIn a single line print the required number of squares.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n0 0\n0 2\n2 0\n2 2\n1 1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\n\nSample Input 2\n\n9\n0 0\n1 1\n2 2\n0 1\n1 0\n0 2\n2 0\n1 2\n2 1\n\nSample Output 2\n\n5",

        "question_title": "Jzzhu and Numbers",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the sprawling empire of Bitlandia, the High Council, led by the wise Jzzhu, faced a peculiar challenge regarding the realm\u2019s citizens. Within the kingdom, there were **n** clans, each known for their unique banner, a symbol that carried a secret code made from shining emblems representing their strengths and weaknesses. These clans\u2019 banners were arranged along the grand avenue of the capital, numbered from the first on the left to the last on the right \u2014 no clan standing out of order or beyond the count of one million, the limit imposed by ancient tradition.\n\nThe council had a curious rule concerning alliances. They considered any gathering of clans, where the warriors from strictly increasing positions congregated, to be a \u201cgroup.\u201d Such a group could be small or sprawling, from just a single clan to all clans united. Yet, not all coalitions were favored. Jzzhu was interested in those rare alliances whose combined emblem, when examined under the Sacred And \u2014 a legendary bond-checking ritual \u2014 revealed zero as the result. This meant that when their banners\u2019 powers crossed, no particular strength overlapped among them, a sign of perfect diversity and harmony. The challenge was to count how many such groups existed, but the number could become impossibly large, so the counting was done under the watchful eye of the Eternal Modulator, which kept tallies within a grand number just over one billion, ensuring order in the archive scrolls.\n\nTo summarize the quest posed to the council\u2019s scribes: first, the scribes would receive a single number, announcing how many clans line the avenue \u2014 a figure no less than one and no more than one million, the grand limit. Next, on the following line, they would read the sequence of clans' banner codes, each a non-negative number that couldn\u2019t stretch beyond one million's reach. The scribes\u2019 task was to declare, as their final scroll, the count of all possible alliances \u2014 with any number of clans from one up to the full line \u2014 whose combined Sacred And equaled the striking zero, all recorded modulo the realm\u2019s treasured constant to prevent numerical chaos.\n\nFor instance, when the scribe saw three clans with banners shining as 2, 3, and 3, no worthy group met the zero harmony \u2014 resulting in a tally of zero. But when four clans carried banners marked 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively, the scroll revealed ten such harmonious alliances, a surprisingly rich crop of peaceful cooperation. In the grandest accounting shown, when six clans bore marks of 5, 2, 0, 5, 2, and 1, the count of zero-harmony groups swelled to fifty-three, showcasing how deeper diversity allowed more perfect coalitions.\n\nThus, in Bitlandia, the scribes diligently balance the sacred numbers, ensuring that the harmonious groups\u2014those whose combined banners hold no clashing strength\u2014are counted with precision, preserving peace and order in the chronicles of alliances, forever under the ever-watchful Eternal Modulator.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nJzzhu have n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an. We will call a sequence of indexes i1, i2, ..., ik (1 \u2264 i1 < i2 < ... < ik \u2264 n) a group of size k.\n\nJzzhu wonders, how many groups exists such that ai1 & ai2 & ... & aik = 0 (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n)? Help him and print this number modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7). Operation x & y denotes bitwise AND operation of two numbers.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 106). The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 \u2264 ai \u2264 106).\n\nOutput Format\nOutput a single integer representing the number of required groups modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n2 3 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n0\n\nSample Input 2\n\n4\n0 1 2 3\n\nSample Output 2\n\n10\n\nSample Input 3\n\n6\n5 2 0 5 2 1\n\nSample Output 3\n\n53",

        "question_title": "Count Good Substrings",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the cutting-edge genetics laboratory of a future where DNA itself is written in the simplest possible code, researchers were fascinated by peculiar sequences composed solely of the two genetic bases named Alpha and Beta. These sequences were crafted as strings of these two bases, and each sequence could stretch up to a precisely controlled length, no longer than one hundred thousand base units, ensuring the lab\u2019s supercomputers could analyze them thoroughly. Every base position in the sequence was either Alpha or Beta, nothing else.\n\nThe lab had discovered an intriguing property among these base strings, which they called \u201charmonious\u201d structure. To determine this harmony, a special procedure was performed: whenever two or more identical bases stood side by side, they were merged into a single representative unit. For example, a stretch like Alpha-Alpha-Beta-Beta-Alpha would transform into Alpha-Beta-Alpha after this compression. If this compressed sequence read the same forward and backward\u2014like a reflection in a genetic mirror\u2014it was deemed harmonious. This notion wasn\u2019t just aesthetic; it signified a symmetry vital for genetic stability. The lab\u2019s challenge was to evaluate every possible substring\u2014a contiguous fragment\u2014of the original genetic string to see which fragments were harmonious, but with a refined goal: to separately tally the harmonious fragments that had an even number of bases and those with an odd number.\n\nThis task required the lab operators to carefully note the entire string first. Once recorded, they needed to examine every possible substring: those starting at any base, ending at any base further along, ensuring each fragment\u2019s length was between one and n bases. For each of these substrings, after compressing consecutive identical bases to one, the researchers were to check if the result mirrored itself exactly from start to end. Importantly, they had to maintain separate counts\u2014how many harmonious substrings contained an even total number of bases before compression, and how many contained an odd total. The goal was to find and report these counts as efficiently and comprehensively as possible, capturing the full symmetry landscape within the original genetic sequence\u2019s vast potential set of substrings.\n\nThe submission of findings followed a strict format: first came the entire original sequence of base codes on a single line, composed only of Alpha and Beta characters, with length up to one hundred thousand. Next, the report would output precisely two numbers separated by a space on a single line\u2014the first number representing the total count of harmonious substrings of even length, and the second representing the count of those with odd length. This format allowed the lab\u2019s central database to immediately assimilate, analyze, and compare the genetic symmetry data across sequences. For example, a sequence with just two Beta units would yield one harmonious substring of even length\u2014the entire string\u2014and two harmonious substrings of odd length, each consisting of the individual bases alone.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the sequence Beta-Alpha-Alpha-Beta. After compression, its harmonious substrings total six: four of them have an odd number of bases before compression, like single bases or mirror-like structures such as Beta-Alpha-Alpha-Beta itself, and two have even lengths, such as the double Alpha substring or the entire string halving to a palindrome. In another example with Beta-Alpha-Beta-Beta, the harmonious count reveals two even-length and five odd-length harmonious substrings, showing the nuanced spread of symmetry even in short sequences. A slightly longer string, like Beta-Alpha-Beta-Alpha-Alpha, expands the counts to two even-length and seven odd-length harmonious substrings, underscoring the lab\u2019s ongoing pursuit of genetic harmonies through this elegant compression and symmetry test.\n\nThus, the researchers continue, decoding the language of genetic symmetry through the lens of compressed palindromic structures, counting their harmonious substrings with careful distinction between even and odd, to better understand the fundamental beauty and balance hidden within sequences of Alpha and Beta bases. Their notes, numbered and systematic, act as a map for future genetic explorers seeking the perfect mirror within the double-helical codes of life itself.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nWe call a string good, if after merging all the consecutive equal characters, the resulting string is palindrome. For example, \"aabba\" is good, because after the merging step it will become \"aba\".\n\nGiven a string, you have to find two values:\n\n1. the number of good substrings of even length;\n2. the number of good substrings of odd length.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains a single string of length n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105). Each character of the string will be either 'a' or 'b'.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint two space-separated integers: the number of good substrings of even length and the number of good substrings of odd length.\n\nSample Input 1\n\nbb\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1 2\n\nSample Input 2\n\nbaab\n\nSample Output 2\n\n2 4\n\nSample Input 3\n\nbabb\n\nSample Output 3\n\n2 5\n\nSample Input 4\n\nbabaa\n\nSample Output 4\n\n2 7\n\nNote\nIn example 1, there are three good substrings (\"b\", \"b\", and \"bb\"). One of them has even length and two of them have odd length.\n\nIn example 2, there are six good substrings (i.e. \"b\", \"a\", \"a\", \"b\", \"aa\", \"baab\"). Two of them have even length and four of them have odd length.\n\nIn example 3, there are seven good substrings (i.e. \"b\", \"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"bb\", \"bab\", \"babb\"). Two of them have even length and five of them have odd length.\n\nDefinitions\n\nA substring s[l, r] (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n) of string s = s1s2... sn is string slsl + 1... sr.\n\nA string s = s1s2... sn is a palindrome if it is equal to string snsn - 1... s1.",

        "question_title": "Three strings",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the heart of the Collaborative Task Scheduling Center, three grand librarians each guard an ancient scroll inscribed with a string of runes. These three scrolls, each inscribed with a unique arrangement of lowercase letters, hold the key to synchronizing the Center\u2019s tasks. The Center\u2019s law decrees that the scrolls must be examined in tandem, testing their patterns for harmonious overlaps that could reveal shared secrets and enable flawless coordination.\n\nThe ritual requires identifying sequences of runes \u2014 segments drawn from the scrolls \u2014 such that when these segments are taken from all three scrolls at once, they are identical in every character and in the same order. For all possible lengths, starting from the smallest possible single rune stretch to the longest segment that can be taken without exceeding the shortest scroll\u2019s length, the Center records how many such perfectly matching triplets of segments exist. The sacred decree forbids examining beyond the length of the shortest scroll, for going further would mean seeking patterns that don\u2019t exist in all three scrolls alike.\n\nEach librarian hands over their scroll, line by line: the first scroll\u2019s runes arrive on the first line, followed by the second\u2019s on the next, and then the third\u2019s on the line after that. The sum of all the runes across the three scrolls together never surpasses three hundred and five thousand, ensuring the examination can be done in a single vigilance cycle. Only the letters from the ancient English tongue, in lowercase, are accepted on these scrolls, maintaining a stable language across the Center.\n\nThe central task for the schedulers is to enumerate, for every possible sequence length, how many triples of identical segments can be forged. Each count must be revealed in a single space-separated line, spanning from the number corresponding to length one up to the number that matches the shortest scroll\u2019s length. To prevent the tally from overwhelming the Center\u2019s record-keepers, each count must be taken modulo a sacred prime, precisely one billion plus seven. This keeps the numbers bound and manageable, like sealing the outcome within a magical lock.\n\nFor instance, when the scrolls read \u201cabc\u201d, \u201cbc\u201d, and \u201ccbc\u201d, the Center finds that for sequences one rune long, three matching triples exist, and when considering sequences two runes long, only one such triple appears. In another case, with longer scrolls inscribed as \u201cabacaba\u201d, \u201cabac\u201d, and \u201cabcd\u201d, the tally of matched triples unfolds as eleven for the shortest sequence, two for the next, and zero for both longer sequences. Thus, the Center\u2019s officials not only confirm the presence of such synchrony but do so with exact precision, enabling their world to move in synchronous harmony.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given three strings (s1, s2, s3). For each integer l (1 \u2264 l \u2264 min(|s1|, |s2|, |s3|) you need to find how many triples (i1, i2, i3) exist such that three strings sk[ik... ik + l - 1] (k = 1, 2, 3) are pairwise equal. Print all found numbers modulo 1000000007\u00a0(109 + 7).\n\nSee notes if you are not sure about some of the denotions used in the statement.\n\nInput Format\nFirst three lines contain three non-empty input strings. The sum of lengths of all strings is no more than 3\u00b7105. All strings consist only of lowercase English letters.\n\nOutput Format\nYou need to output min(|s1|, |s2|, |s3|) numbers separated by spaces \u2014 answers for the problem modulo 1000000007\u00a0(109 + 7).\n\nSample Input 1\n\nabc\nbc\ncbc\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3 1\n\nSample Input 2\n\nabacaba\nabac\nabcd\n\nSample Output 2\n\n11 2 0 0\n\nNote\nConsider a string t = t1t2... t|t|, where ti denotes the i-th character of the string, and |t| denotes the length of the string.\n\nThen t[i... j] (1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 |t|) represents the string titi + 1... tj (substring of t from position i to position j inclusive).",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\n**Urban Legend Investigator Log: The Enigma of the Whispering Steps**\n\nIn the heart of the city, there exists an ancient stairway known only to a few\u2014its steps rumored to whisper secrets of hidden patterns. Two curious souls, Serega and Fedor, stumbled upon these cryptic steps during their nightly wanderings. The stairway stretched across a sequence of stones, each etched with a number, representing the weight carried by that stone. They noticed a peculiar ritual: starting from any stone, one could climb upward, but the cost of stepping onto a stone depended mysteriously on the costs of previous steps in a way begging to be unraveled.\n\nThe stairway's pattern followed a peculiar social code: The first step, or position, on the bottom row would always speak its own secret aloud\u2014the weight of the stone itself. For every step thereafter, the whispered value was the smallest toll encountered from the step directly below or diagonally behind it, plus the weight of the new stone. But there was a catch\u2014only those stones situated not earlier in the sequence than the step number itself could be part of the climb, anchoring the journey within a certain pyramid shape. The stones stretched infinitely up to a vast length, no more than one hundred thousand stones, each carrying a non-negative burden no heavier than ten thousand units.\n\nYearning to understand the stairway\u2019s gossip, Serega and Fedor sought not mere glimpses but clarity on specific points along this sequence of echoes. They faced numerous queries from fellow wanderers, each asking: \"What is the secret toll whispered when stepping on the stone found at this exact level and position?\" The rules that governed these queries were strict\u2014every request would point to a position at least as high as the level indicated, never below. Serega and Fedor\u2019s challenge was to deliver answers for millions of such questions as swiftly and accurately as possible, respecting the order and constraints of the stairway\u2019s logic and the social hierarchy embedded within.\n\nTheir records began with a declaration of how many stones lined the ancient path. On the next line, the weights of all stones were listed in order of their place on the path. Following this were the queries\u2014how many whispered values were sought, and each query detailed exactly which level and stone position its inquirer wished to know. The secret they sought to unveil lay in carefully tracing the path, always choosing the lighter toll of stepping ahead or diagonally before embracing the cost of the current stone, and then recounting this total for each point of curiosity. Their notes ended with responses to each query, one per line\u2014each number a key to the whispered story behind that step.\n\nOne of their classic tales was etched as follows: six stones bore weights of 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, and 4, and four queries posed the question about the whispered tolls at various stair positions. The answers came clearly\u201412 at the fourth level stone five, 9 both times for the third level stone four, and 5 at the second level stone three\u2014reflecting the stairway\u2019s quiet but consistent logic. Another tale involved seven stones marked with weights 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 0, and 2, and again, four earnest asks that yielded responses: 11, 4, 3, and 0, each answer unraveling the subtle, layered cost of climbing those secretive steps.\n\nThus, through this careful chronicling, Serega and Fedor became master interpreters of the stairway\u2019s silent language\u2014unraveling the whispering steps not only once but countless times, bestowing upon all who asked the knowledge hidden within the stairs, their answers both swift and true.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nSerega and Fedor play with functions. One day they came across a very interesting function. It looks like that:\n\n- f(1, j) = a[j], 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n.\n- f(i, j) = min(f(i - 1, j), f(i - 1, j - 1)) + a[j], 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n, i \u2264 j \u2264 n.\n\nHere a is an integer array of length n.\n\nSerega and Fedya want to know what values this function takes at some points. But they don't want to calculate the values manually. So they ask you to help them.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105) \u2014 the length of array a. The next line contains n integers: a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] (0 \u2264 a[i] \u2264 104).\n\nThe next line contains integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 105) \u2014 the number of queries. Each of the next m lines contains two integers: xi, yi (1 \u2264 xi \u2264 yi \u2264 n). Each line means that Fedor and Serega want to know the value of f(xi, yi).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint m lines \u2014 the answers to the guys' queries.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n6\n2 2 3 4 3 4\n4\n4 5\n3 4\n3 4\n2 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n12\n9\n9\n5\n\nSample Input 2\n\n7\n1 3 2 3 4 0 2\n4\n4 5\n2 3\n1 4\n4 6\n\nSample Output 2\n\n11\n4\n3\n0",

The newest quest was underway\u2014becoming the beloved governor of this lively town. As the caretaker of this lively hub, you had done your homework: each customer whispered their loyalty to a particular contender, and some, if tempted well enough with the fine aromas and tokens of appreciation, might be persuaded to cast their vote in your favor. However, becoming governor could only be done by having more votes than anyone else, strictly more\u2014not just tying for the lead but outshining every rival.\n\nThe city's rules were peculiar. There were as many seats at the tea tables as there were voters, up to one hundred thousand souls drawn from all walks of life. Each visitor favored a single champion currently, a number marking their allegiance, quiet as the steam rising from their cup. Some would switch to your banner if the offering of goodwill\u2014the bribe\u2014reached their liking. This cost varied, from none at all for those already true to you, to sums reaching tens of thousands of copper coins. Strangely, if someone was already with you, their price for loyalty was always zero, a firm bond not needing to be bought. The challengers a voter supported could be any number, even reaching a staggering, lofty name unmet in most corners of the city.\n\nYour mission was clear: find the least costly way to sway enough voters such that your votes rise strictly above all others. The balancing act required meticulous planning\u2014convince merely enough, but no more coins wasted than necessary in this subtle campaign of persuasion. The tally starts with the number of customers, followed by a ledger of each visitor\u2019s present loyalty and the price to bring their vote to your side.\n\nFor example, one bustling evening, five visitors arrived: three favored the same rival, one another, and one was an old friend already loyal. The total coins spent to outshine them all turned out to be just three, bought with wisdom and the right number of cups and smiles. On another day, with only four patrons, two lined behind one rival, and one loyalist was true to you; a careful offering of two coins secured the victory. Even a single visitor, though fiercely independent and supporting a hundred thousandth name, could mind the unexpected: since they already stood with you, no coin needed be parted.\n\nThus, your ledger grows, entries in hand, as your tea house quietly becomes the unseen battleground of hearts and votes. In every tale told and cup filled, the question lingers\u2014what is the smallest treasure you must part with to reign as governor, keeping the peace in ballots and at the tea tables alike?\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are running for a governor in a small city in Russia. You ran some polls and did some research, and for every person in the city you know whom he will vote for, and how much it will cost to bribe that person to vote for you instead of whomever he wants to vote for right now. You are curious, what is the smallest amount of money you need to spend on bribing to win the elections. To win elections you need to have strictly more votes than any other candidate.\n\nInput Format\nFirst line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105) \u2014 number of voters in the city. Each of the next n lines describes one voter and contains two integers ai and bi (0 \u2264 ai \u2264 105;\u00a00 \u2264 bi \u2264 104) \u2014 number of the candidate that voter is going to vote for and amount of money you need to pay him to change his mind. You are the candidate 0 (so if a voter wants to vote for you, ai is equal to zero, in which case bi will also be equal to zero).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint one integer \u2014 smallest amount of money you need to spend to win the elections.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n1 2\n1 2\n1 2\n2 1\n0 0\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3\n\nSample Input 2\n\n4\n1 2\n1 2\n2 1\n0 0\n\nSample Output 2\n\n2\n\nSample Input 3\n\n1\n100000 0\n\nSample Output 3\n\n0",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn a distant realm, where the gods often tested mortals through trials of wisdom and courage, there lay a challenge known as the Path of Powers. The land was marked by *N* sacred towers, each a beacon of mystical significance, connected by *M* ancient roads that twisted across mountains and valleys. Each road bore a weight, not measured by mere distance, but by the celestial force drawn from the sky\u2014powers of two etched invisibly into the very fabric of the path. The decrees of the gods forbade any tower to be linked to itself, or to have multiple roads to another single tower\u2014each connection was unique and singular.\n\nIn this divine puzzle, a hero is summoned to travel from a Tower of Beginning to a Tower of Destiny. These towers were identified by their unique cosmic numbers, chosen between one and the total count of towers. The hero must find the journey whose sum of celestial forces on its roads is the lightest, for the weight of a road was known only by the exponent of two it bore: a road with the mark *X* held the mighty cost of two raised to the power *X*. These powers could be as vast as 10 raised to the fifth, thus the hero needed to measure their steps carefully lest the journey become impossibly long or impossible altogether.\n\nThe challenge was precise: first, the hero would receive the grand count of towers and roads in the sacred land, presented plainly on a single scroll line. Following this, each of the next *M* scroll lines would reveal the twin towers connected by a single road and the hidden celestial mark of that road\u2019s cost, given as the sacred power *X*. The final line of this divine script indicated the two chosen towers: the start and the end of the hero\u2019s destined path. Careful to walk no forbidden loop or cross the same road twice, the hero must seek either a chain of towers that leads unerringly from the start to the destination with the least summation of celestial costs or declare that the gods have rendered the path impossible.\n\nOnce the hero embarked, the success was recorded in the annals. If a path was found, the total cost of the journey\u2014summed powers of two along the route\u2014needed to be spoken aloud, yet only after the sacred number from the heavens, one billion and seven, was used to divide this cost and whisper the remainder, ensuring balance with cosmic laws. Then the scroll of the journey\u2019s route would unfold in three sacred lines: first the remainder of the distance, then the count of towers the hero stepped through, and finally the list of those towers in their exact visitation order, beginning with the start and concluding with the destination. Should multiple paths share this celestial grace of minimal cost, any would be worthy to recount. But if no path was to be found, the oracle would only pronounce the sorrowful number minus one, the sign of the gods\u2019 disfavor.\n\nTo illustrate, in one trial, four towers and four roads laid before the hero. The roads connected towers one and four by a celestial mark of two, one and two by zero, two and three by zero, and three and four by zero. The hero was to travel from tower one to tower four. The gods revealed the shortest path cost, followed by revealing the full journey through four towers, traveling the sequence one, two, three, and finally four. In another trial, several roads bore higher powers, resulting in a large total cost that was spoken modulo the sacred billion and seven. In a solemn final example, a disconnected pair of towers foiled the hero\u2019s quest, and the oracle solemnly responded with a minus one, declaring no sacred path existed.\n\nThus, the Path of Powers tested not only the measure of the hero\u2019s courage but the wisdom to reckon distance in the language of celestial exponents, seeking always the lightest route across the bounded world of towers and roads.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a weighted undirected graph on n vertices and m edges. Find the shortest path from vertex s to vertex t or else state that such path doesn't exist.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers \u2014 n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105; 0 \u2264 m \u2264 105).\n\nNext m lines contain the description of the graph edges. The i-th line contains three space-separated integers \u2014 ui, vi, xi (1 \u2264 ui, vi \u2264 n; 0 \u2264 xi \u2264 105). That means that vertices with numbers ui and vi are connected by edge of length 2xi (2 to the power of xi).\n\nThe last line contains two space-separated integers \u2014 the numbers of vertices s and t.\n\nThe vertices are numbered from 1 to n. The graph contains no multiple edges and self-loops.\n\nOutput Format\nIn the first line print the remainder after dividing the length of the shortest path by 1000000007\u00a0(109 + 7) if the path exists, and -1 if the path doesn't exist.\n\nIf the path exists print in the second line integer k \u2014 the number of vertices in the shortest path from vertex s to vertex t; in the third line print k space-separated integers \u2014 the vertices of the shortest path in the visiting order. The first vertex should be vertex s, the last vertex should be vertex t. If there are multiple shortest paths, print any of them.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4 4\n1 4 2\n1 2 0\n2 3 0\n3 4 0\n1 4\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n\nSample Input 2\n\n4 3\n1 2 4\n2 3 5\n3 4 6\n1 4\n\nSample Output 2\n\n112\n4\n1 2 3 4\n\nSample Input 3\n\n4 2\n1 2 0\n3 4 1\n1 4\n\nSample Output 3\n\n-1\n\nNote\nA path from vertex s to vertex t is a sequence v0, ..., vk, such that v0 = s, vk = t, and for any i from 0 to k - 1 vertices vi and vi + 1 are connected by an edge.\n\nThe length of the path is the sum of weights of edges between vi and vi + 1 for all i from 0 to k - 1.\n\nThe shortest path from s to t is the path which length is minimum among all possible paths from s to t.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the sprawling metropolis of Cyberia, a grand E-Sports tournament called the \"Modulus Masters\" was held annually, drawing players from across the digital realms. Each contender brought a unique set of power chips\u2014shimmering tokens of strength and skill\u2014that would be their arsenal in the games to come. These chips ranged widely in power level, from humble sparks barely glowing to mighty cores blazing with intensity. The total number of chips each contender wielded could reach up to two hundred thousand, making the competition fierce and sprawling.\n\nWithin the code-lined arenas of Cyberia, the ultimate challenge was known as the \"Remainder Clash.\" In this contest, two power chips were chosen for their clash, adhering to a strict but curious code of conduct: the first chip\u2019s strength had to be at least as great as the second\u2019s, maintaining a balance of power within the duel. When these two met, the greater chip absorbed the essence of the lesser one, and what remained after this absorption\u2014the mystical \"remainder\" of energy\u2014shone bright as a measure of cunning and efficiency. Champions sought to find the pair of chips within their array that produced the greatest possible remainder when the more potent chip was divided by the lesser, proving their ability to harness and optimize power beyond simple strength.\n\nBefore the grand match, each participant declared their armory to the grand algorithmic judge. The declaration began with a single number, signaling how many chips they carried\u2014a figure potentially soaring to two hundred thousand. On the next line, they listed the strength values of each chip in precise order, each strength falling somewhere between the faintest glimmer of 1 and the radiant zenith of one million and six. The task was clear: devise a strategy to select the pair of chips that would maximize the remainder energy when orchestrated in their righteous order of strength.\n\nAs the digital clock neared zero, competitors submitted their pulse calculations. For instance, a player carrying three chips spoke first: their chips pulsed at powers three, four, and five. The synthesis of these chips, when paired wisely, uncovered a maximum remainder of two\u2014a spark bright enough to dazzle judges and rivals alike. This meticulous choice of chips was a demonstration of not just raw power, but of mastery over the essence residues left in the wake of absorption battles.\n\nIn conclusion, the trial of the Modulus Masters was a testament to both strength and strategy: from the single count of chips to the largest battalion of two hundred thousand, from the faintest glow to the fiercest blaze, the champions needed to find the pairs whose clashes revealed the greatest relics of remainder energy. Participants presented their digits in sequence, and the echoes of their best remainders were returned as the final score\u2014an emblem of their dominance in the realm of modular combat.\n\nThus, the tale of Cyberia\u2019s tournament stands: from a simple trio of chips, a maximum remainder of two is gleaned, a shining proof that the greatest victory lies not just in power, but in the artful remainder of power.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a sequence a consisting of n integers.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\n**Parallel Universe Synchronization Log: The Fragmentation of Alexandra\u2019s Quantum Sequence**\n\nIn the dimension of Quantaris, the enigmatic archivist Alexandra wields an ancient ribbon\u2014the Quantum Sequence\u2014etched with a long chain of mystical numerals, arranged from the origin point of the ribbon to its terminus. The ribbon\u2019s length is governed by the ancient laws to not exceed one hundred thousand inscriptions, and the numbers inscribed on it may span from deeply negative energies to highly positive vibrations.\n\nAs the cosmic ritual unfolds, Alexandra must partition this Quantum Sequence into contiguous segments, each serving as an independent quantum packet. However, the laws of Quantaris decree two sacred constraints for every packet carved from the ribbon: first, each packet must hold no fewer than a set minimum number of inscriptions\u2014imagine this as the strength needed to maintain the quantum coherence within each packet. Second, within any single packet, the disparity between the highest and the lowest energy markings must not surpass a mystical bound, a limit ensuring stable resonance and preventing quantum collapse.\n\nAlexandra\u2019s challenge, recorded in this synchronization log, is to fragment the entire Quantum Sequence into as few coherent packets as possible while strictly abiding by these cosmic bounds. She must either reveal the minimal count of packets achievable or declare that such harmonious partitioning is impossible within the given cosmic parameters.\n\nThe input to this ordeal begins with a single celestial line containing three grand numerals: the first reveals the total count of the inscriptions on the ribbon, bounded to be no larger than a hundred thousand; the second is the symbol of the maximum allowable energy gap within any quantum packet, a figure reaching into billions; the third is the revered minimal cluster size each segment must maintain, also restricted to no more than a hundred thousand inscriptions. On the subsequent line, the entire inscription array appears, a sequence of integers possibly spanning vast energetic spectra, their values ranging between powerful negative and positive thresholds.\n\nThe outcome expected from this cosmic operation is singular: output a solitary figure denoting the fewest segments Alexandra can manifest that satisfy both the minimal size and the cap on energy dispersion. If no such alignment exists, the log demands `-1` be inscribed.\n\nFor instance, consider the sequence of seven inscriptions where the maximum energy gap allowed is but a modest two and each segment must contain no fewer than two inscriptions. The inscription line reads: 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2. After careful partitioning, the Quantum Sequence might elegantly split into three harmonious packets: the first holding the cluster [1, 3, 1], the second, a balanced duo [2, 4], and the third, a final pair [1, 2]. This yields the minimal count of three packets satisfying the laws of Quantaris.\n\nConversely, when faced with a similar series where energies wildly alternate between low and high\u2014such as alternating 1 and 100 across seven inscriptions\u2014no quantum packet can span the energetic chasm without violating the maximum energy gap decree. Consequently, Alexandra must record `-1`, signaling the impossibility of a stable partitioning under these cosmic standards.\n\nThus ends the synchronization log of Alexandra\u2019s Quantum Sequence fragmentation, a quest not merely of division but of optimal harmonious arrangement within the stringent world of Quantaris.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nAlexandra has a paper strip with n numbers on it. Let's call them ai from left to right.\n\nNow Alexandra wants to split it into some pieces (possibly 1).

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the heart of a sprawling, ancient mansion shrouded in mystery, there lies a unique challenge only the most astute minds dare to unravel. This mansion is not merely a building, but a complex network of interconnected chambers, each inscribed with a single cryptic rune. The structure of these chambers forms an intricate arboreal labyrinth: every chamber is connected to others by secret passageways, creating a web of connections akin to the branching limbs of a great tree. There dwell exactly as many chambers as some large whole number, not exceeding three hundred thousand, each adorned with a solitary letter from the timeless language of the ancients.\n\nNow, the inhabitants have devised a ritual \u2014 when one chooses any two chambers, they can whisper the sequence of runes found along the direct path between them, from the first chosen chamber to the second. This sequence forms a mystical string, unique to that chosen pair of chambers. But the mansion holds further secrets: the elders have set forth a series of riddles, each demanding a comparison of two such rune-strings, obtained from two separate pairs of chambers. For each riddle, you are given four distinct chambers, divided into two pairs; from each pair, you summon the rune sequence as before, traversing the passageways from the first chamber of the pair to the second. Your task is to determine \u2014 with the keenest wit \u2014 the length of the longest initial shared sequence of runes between these two summoned strings. In other words, how far does their common beginning stretch before their runes diverge?\n\nThe mansion\u2019s rules are as strict as they are elegant. The number of chambers is a grand number under three hundred thousand. Each chamber bears a rune \u2014 a lowercase letter \u2014 which marks its identity. The secret passageways are such that every chamber can be reached from any other without looping back, forging a delicate balance of connections numbering exactly one less than the chambers themselves. Then come the riddles \u2014 up to one million in number \u2014 each giving you the four chambers for comparison. Your goal is not merely to solve one riddle, but to decipher all of them efficiently, revealing the lengths of these longest shared opening rune sequences between pairs of paths, as quickly and accurately as your mind can fathom.\n\nTo seek answers in this mystic mansion, you first note down the total chambers, followed by the runes decorating them, all given in a single line. Then, you learn the passageways that bind these chambers, each told in two numbers telling you which chambers are linked. The next law of the game reveals the number of riddles posed, each specified by four chamber numbers: the start and end of the first path, then the start and end of the second path to compare. For each set, the output you must declare on its own line is the measure of the longest shared prefix that the two path-rune sequences possess, a number revealing the depth of their similarity.\n\nConsider, for instance, a mansion with six chambers \u2014 each chamber bearing runes \u201cbbbabb\u201d in that order. The passages link chamber 2 to 1, 3 to 2, 4 to 3, 5 to 2, and 6 to 5, weaving a tree of secret links. A series of six riddles then arises, asking for comparisons along:\n\n- From chamber 2 to 5, and chamber 3 to 1,\n- From chamber 1 to 5, and chamber 2 to 3,\n- From chamber 5 to 6, and chamber 5 to 6,\n- From chamber 6 to 3, and chamber 4 to 1,\n- From chamber 6 to 2, and chamber 3 to 4,\n- From chamber 2 to 2, and chamber 4 to 5.\n\nThe wondrous answers to these riddles \u2014 lengths of the greatest shared rune beginnings \u2014 reveal themselves as: 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, and 0, each on its own line. Thus, the mansion divulges its secrets step by step to those clever enough to chart its paths and read its inscriptions.\n\nWithin these walls of runes and pathways, your challenge is clear: decode the longest common prefixes of rune sequences along forbidden paths, answering all the ancient riddles, unlocking the mansion's secrets with logic and precision.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nMisha has a tree with characters written on the vertices. He can choose two vertices s and t of this tree and write down characters of vertices lying on a path from s to t. We'll say that such string corresponds to pair (s, t).\n\nMisha has m queries of type: you are given 4 vertices a, b, c, d; you need to find the largest common prefix of the strings that correspond to pairs (a, b) and (c, d). Your task is to help him.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300 000) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nNext follows a line consisting of n small English letters. The i-th character of the string corresponds to the character written on the i-th vertex.\n\nNext n - 1 lines contain information about edges. An edge is defined by a pair of integers u, v (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n, u \u2260 v), separated by spaces.\n\nThe next line contains integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 1 000 000) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nNext m lines contain information about queries. A query is defined by four integers a, b, c, d (1 \u2264 a, b, c, d \u2264 n), separated by spaces.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each query print the length of the largest common prefix on a separate line.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n6\nbbbabb\n2 1\n3 2\n4 3\n5 2\n6 5\n6\n2 5 3 1\n1 5 2 3\n5 6 5 6\n6 3 4 1\n6 2 3 4\n2 2 4 5\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n2\n2\n0\n1\n0",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn a realm where time travel is governed by strict regulations, the Temporal Council oversees countless pathways connecting myriad points in history. Each point in time is represented as an ancient gate, and these gates are linked by shimmering threads of various hues. The realm comprises a vast network of such gates\u2014numbered from the very first dawn to the latest moment known\u2014connected by these colored threads that dictate the flow of time travelers. Some gates are bound together by a single brilliantly colored thread, while others share multiple hues, enabling more complex journeys. This network is vast, reaching up to one hundred thousand gates and as many threads weaving through time itself.\n\nThe temporal law states that each thread's color represents a unique type of chronological link, and no exact same hue can tie the same two gates more than once. Threads cast between gates might cross multiple points, but the colors remain distinct for each unique connection. The council has cataloged all direct links between points, each described by the two gates it binds, the resting order of the gates (always from a smaller moment to a later one), and the color glint of the thread. The task at hand must answer numerous inquiries\u2014each question asks how many unique link colors can connect two separate gates, whether by a single thread or via a path woven solely of one color\u2019s threads. \n\nYour mission is to become the Temporal Analyst, tasked with decoding these inquiries for the council. For each query, you receive the numbers of two distinct gates and must determine the count of colors whose threads connect these gates either directly or through other gates linked by the same hue. The objective is to uncover, as completely as possible, the spectrum of colors enabling passage between those two moments in history. The efficiency of your answers must scale for tens of thousands of gates, threads, and inquiries\u2014to fulfill the council\u2019s demand that time travelers' routes be verified swiftly and reliably.\n\nThe council\u2019s ledger records: The first page lists two integers denoting the number of temporal gates and linking threads. Following that, each line details a connection by stating the earlier and later gate numbers and the thread\u2019s unique color. Then appears the tally of temporal queries followed by each pair of gate numbers in question. For example, when presented with four gates and five threads of colors one through three, the question of how many colors link gate one to gate two yields two, as two thread colors entwine those gates. The passage from gate three to four involves only one color, while from gate one to four no single color\u2019s threads form a pathway, producing a count of zero.\n\nThus, to maintain the order of time, you must, for every query, declare the exact number of thread colors intrinsically connecting the specified gates. By unraveling the vibrant tapestry of temporal links, you ensure lawful and efficient time travel along the council\u2019s illuminated network, safeguarding history from paradox.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nMr. Kitayuta has just bought an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. The vertices of the graph are numbered from 1 to n. Each edge, namely edge i, has a color ci, connecting vertex ai and bi.\n\nMr. Kitayuta wants you to process the following q queries.\n\nIn the i-th query, he gives you two integers - ui and vi.\n\nFind the number of the colors that satisfy the following condition: the edges of that color connect vertex ui and vertex vi directly or indirectly.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains space-separated two integers - n and m(2 \u2264 n \u2264 105, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 105), denoting the number of the vertices and the number of the edges, respectively.\n\nThe next m lines contain space-separated three integers - ai, bi(1 \u2264 ai < bi \u2264 n) and ci(1 \u2264 ci \u2264 m). Note that there can be multiple edges between two vertices. However, there are no multiple edges of the same color between two vertices, that is, if i \u2260 j, (ai, bi, ci) \u2260 (aj, bj, cj).\n\nThe next line contains a integer- q(1 \u2264 q \u2264 105), denoting the number of the queries.\n\nThen follows q lines, containing space-separated two integers - ui and vi(1 \u2264 ui, vi \u2264 n). It is guaranteed that ui \u2260 vi.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each query, print the answer in a separate line.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4 5\n1 2 1\n1 2 2\n2 3 1\n2 3 3\n2 4 3\n3\n1 2\n3 4\n1 4\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n1\n0\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5 7\n1 5 1\n2 5 1\n3 5 1\n4 5 1\n1 2 2\n2 3 2\n3 4 2\n5\n1 5\n5 1\n2 5\n1 5\n1 4\n\nSample Output 2\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n\nNote\nLet's consider the first sample.\n\nThe figure above shows the first sample.\n\n- Vertex 1 and vertex 2 are connected by color 1 and 2.\n- Vertex 3 and vertex 4 are connected by color 3.\n- Vertex 1 and vertex 4 are not connected by any single color.",

Each index in the list corresponds to a vertex, and the value at that index is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an edge connected to that vertex. The tuple contains the neighbor vertex and the color of the edge.\n\n2. **Depth First Search (DFS):**\n   - The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search starting from a given node.\n   - It uses a `visited` array to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - It also uses a `color_set` to store the colors encountered during the traversal.\n\n3. **Processing Queries:**\n   - For each query `(u, v)`, we perform a DFS from node `u`.\n   - The `color_set` will contain all the colors that connect `u` to `v` either directly or indirectly.\n   - We return the size of the `color_set` as the answer.\n\n4. **Input and Output:**\n   - The code reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `edges`, `q`, and `queries`.\n   - It calls the `find_colors` function to process the queries.\n   - Finally, it prints the answers for each query.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\n",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the shadowed, whispering halls of the Haunted Library, there exists a sacred lexicon known only to the chosen few\u2014an ancient tome of ascending numbers, each inscribed not with the number itself, but with the secret heartbeat of its digits. The guardian of these glyphs, Vasya, once held a strict line of magic numbers. Each number was more immense than the last, climbing higher as if reaching toward some phantom star. This chain, called the **Original Sequence**, contained only positive integers whose digits shimmered with cryptic sums. \n\nOne dreadful night, the original scroll was lost among spectral echoes, leaving behind only the **Transmuted Sequence**\u2014a procession of numbers that whispered the sum of the digits of each vanished number. The haunted whispers tell us that the lost numbers could be more than one set of possibilities, yet among these fragile shadows exists a unique chain whose final incantation\u2014the last number\u2014casts the faintest glow across the chamber, the smallest possible end to the rising spell.\n\nHerein lies the covenant: You will first be handed a number, spoken as truth by the spectral librarian, which tells you how many enchanted digits the sequence contains, no more than three hundred glyphs, a number neither too small to be trivial nor too vast to exhaust the mind. Then, on each successive line, the sequence of summoned sums is revealed, each no less than one and no greater than three hundred, marking the spectral sum of digits of each lost number in the original ascendance.\n\nYour quest is to invoke a chain of numbers that grows strictly loftier with each step\u2014as if climbing a stairway of spectral fire\u2014where no number is merely equal to or falling behind the last. For each guardian sum given, you must reconstruct a positive integer whose digits, when counted and combined in secret, match exactly that number\u2019s mystic sum. Among all such possible resurrection sequences, your challenge is to bring forth the one whose final number is the smallest possible shining beacon in the spectral gloom\u2014a true test of restraint and precision in ascending magic.\n\nFor example, when the spectral librarian first reveals three glyphs, with their summoned sums as one, two, and three upon three successive lines, your conjuration would simply be the sequence of numbers one, two, and three themselves\u2014each rising in perfect harmony, each digit sum faithfully matching the spectral cues. However, should the sums appear in a falling fashion\u2014three, then two, then one\u2014a more cunning spell is required. One might then summon the number three, followed by eleven (because its digits one and one sum to two), and then a hundred, whose single one amid zeros sums to one\u2014thereby ensuring the chain strictly ascends, yet respects the digit sums given.\n\nThus, in the ritual script of the Haunted Library, your responses must take shape as a list of positive integers, each laid down on a separate parchment line, matching the spectral sums and ascending without pause. Should multiple such sequences exist that satisfy the constraints and minimize the final number, you may offer any among them\u2014no illusion of leading zeroes shall be tolerated, for the spirits disdain false mimicry.\n\nEmbrace the challenge, for the lexicon waits, and the spectral numbers yearn to be called forth once more in their rightful order.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nVasya had a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers a1, ..., an. Vasya used it to build a new sequence b1, ..., bn, where bi is the sum of digits of ai's decimal representation. Then sequence ai got lost and all that remained is sequence bi.\n\nVasya wonders what the numbers ai could be like. Of all the possible options he likes the one sequence with the minimum possible last number an. Help Vasya restore the initial sequence.\n\nIt is guaranteed that such a sequence always exists.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a single integer number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300).\n\nNext n lines contain integer numbers b1, ..., bn \u00a0\u2014 the required sums of digits. All bi belong to the range 1 \u2264 bi \u2264 300.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint n integer numbers, one per line\u00a0\u2014 the correct option for numbers ai, in order of following in sequence. The sequence should be strictly increasing. The sum of digits of the i-th number should be equal to bi.\n\nIf there are multiple sequences with least possible number an, print any of them. Print the numbers without leading zeroes.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n1\n2\n3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\n2\n3\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3\n3\n2\n1\n\nSample Output 2\n\n3\n11\n100",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the bustling floating market of Eldoria, merchants keep careful ledgers of their daily wares arranged in long rows upon the decks of swaying boats. Each merchant\u2019s ledger holds a sequence of tokens \u2014 some shining bright, others dull and worn \u2014 where each token\u2019s type is marked by a secret symbol, known only to the traders themselves. The ledger could be vast, sometimes stretching to an incredible length, containing up to half a million tokens. Alongside the ledgers, a council of merchants poses challenges: given a stretch of these ledgers, they ask for the smallest gap between two identical tokens within that given stretch, for finding patterns in wares and predicting the market trends.\n\nThe world of Eldoria runs by precise rules. Each challenge the council sets includes two markers, each pointing to a position somewhere in the merchant\u2019s ledger. These markers create a bounded interval of tokens on the ledger's timeline \u2014 from the earlier to the later marker\u2019s hold, covering a range of tokens between them and including those at their positions. The challenge: in this neat slice of time, is there a pair of identical tokens belonging to the same symbol family? If so, what is the smallest distance, counted by the number of tokens between the two identical ones? The distance is simply how far apart they are on the ledger, counting how many tokens lie between their positions. If no such identical pair exists in that swath, the answer is a solemn \u201c-1,\u201d signaling no matching closeness found.\n\nNow, here\u2019s how the task unfolds for every merchant and reporter in the bustling docks: first, the ledger is shared as a long line of tokens, each distinctly marked by their secret symbol. This appears as a single line of numbers describing the secret marks of each token. Then, for every challenge posed by the council, there is a line naming the two markers, one for the start and one for the end of the query\u2019s focus on the ledger. The merchant\u2019s chosen job is to find and report the closest pair of twin tokens between these markers. The goal is not just to find any pair but to find the very closest possible pair, revealing tight-knit redundancies or precious repeats in the merchant\u2019s wares for smarter trade.\n\nTo better understand, consider the reports from two trades gathered from the market logs. In the first, the ledger has five tokens with values whispering secrets like \"1, 1, 2, 3, 2.\" The council asks of three intervals: from the very first to the last token, from the second through the fourth, and from the third through the fifth token. The merchant replies: the closest identical pair for the whole spread is one token apart (the pair of \u20181\u2019s at positions one and two), for the interval from the second to fourth tokens, no twins peek out, and for the last stretch, the \u20182\u2019s echo twice, here with a distance of two tokens.\n\nIn the second market\u2019s account, six tokens tell tales tagged \"1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3,\" and the council\u2019s demands multiply into five queries, each seeking the closest twin tokens in their respective intervals. The merchant reports distances varying from two tokens apart to none at all, acknowledging when no repeats dwell in the queried range with a thoughtful \u201c-1.\u201d These insights, when carefully logged, help shape the understanding of market flows and the deep patterns hidden in the rising and falling sequence of goods.\n\nThus, the floating market\u2019s ledger and the council\u2019s queries form a dance of numbers and distances, uncovering the rhythm in the merchant\u2019s hoard, beckoning traders to know not just what goods they hold, but how intimately some tokens whisper of twins and patterns within the flowing tides of the market\u2019s ever-spun sequence.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given sequence a1, a2, ..., an and m queries lj, rj (1 \u2264 lj \u2264 rj \u2264 n).

Our string-length, the very track our Lexicons glide upon, stretches precisely as far as the grand map\u2019s first announcement declares\u2014never falling short of one nor ever exceeding one hundred thousand stable nodes. Beneath this sprawling network, an undulating sequence of humble lowercase letters paints the story of our journey, each letter a station awaiting the traveler\u2019s command.\n\nNow, as the day unfolds, the Grand Terminal releases a chorus of exactly q dispatches\u2014queries, as we call them in the announcement system. Their purpose: to reorganize and reorder the string\u2019s segments according to specific communal rules embedded in our station\u2019s etiquette. Each query heralds three key messages: the starting stop, where the sorting shall begin; the ending stop, marking the complete stretch for the operation; and the orientation token\u2014either one, to align the passengers ascending along the alphabet path from A to Z, or zero, to send them descending from Z to A. These instructions must be executed in perfect sequence, reshuffling the lexical travelers within the indicated bounds, mirroring their corresponding ascending or descending wishes.\n\nYour honored role in this grand recital is to receive the initial stretch of the string\u2014a lovingly crafted sequence of letters tracing through our terminal\u2014and methodically process each of these q requests. After all instructions have been dutifully carried out, the resulting arrangement of letters must be announced aloud, reflecting the cumulative effect of these sortings. This final mixed melody of letters is the terminal\u2019s pride, showcasing the harmony after all the twists and turns through the world\u2019s alphabet tunnel.\n\nLet us consider an example of ten stations lined up, carrying the letters \u201cabacdabcda.\u201d Over a series of five announcements, specific intervals between stations are reordered: descending the final four stations, ascending the middle four, then descending the first four, followed by descending another middle segment, and finally ascending the last four once again. This process gradually weaves intricate patterns of letters like \u201ccbcaaaabdd,\u201d revealing the terminal\u2019s fluid logic of order and chaos tempered by precise commands.\n\nImagine another scene, where a string of ten letters\u2014\u201cagjucbvdfk\u201d\u2014must be sorted not in splintered sections but entirely at once, ascending gracefully from the first to the last station. The alphabet\u2019s natural rise transforms the chaotic array into a perfectly aligned \u201cabcdfgjkuv,\u201d a testament to the power of unity under the terminal\u2019s guiding orders.\n\nThus ends our tale of the Lexicon Express, a place where strings of letters twist and turn through stations, guided by the strict yet elegant edicts of sorting queries. Keep your ears tuned to the announcements, for each command shapes the words waiting patiently to tell their next story.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nThis task is very simple. Given a string S of length n and q queries each query is on the format i j k which means sort the substring consisting of the characters from i to j in non-decreasing order if k = 1 or in non-increasing order if k = 0.\n\nOutput the final string after applying the queries.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line will contain two integers n, q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105, 0 \u2264 q \u2264 50 000), the length of the string and the number of queries respectively.\n\nNext line contains a string S itself.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the curious realm of Monster Evolution, there exists a grand collection of creatures numbered in a line, each bearing a unique strength value. The line stretches from the first to the n-th beast, with n being as large as three hundred thousand and five\u2014a majestic number illustrating the potential scale of this world. Alongside the beasts stands a mystical bond distance, called k, which defines how far apart pairs of monsters are linked in a tale of power differences. This bond distance is never too long\u2014a cap exists, never more than five thousand, or one less than the total number of creatures, whichever is smaller, maintaining a balanced connection between them.\n\nThe elders of this land seek to reorder the line of monsters, not arbitrarily, but in such a way that the combined strain caused by these bonds is as light as possible. This strain is calculated by looking at each pair of creatures spaced exactly k steps apart in the line, measuring the absolute difference in their strengths, and summing these differences from the very first monster up to the one that still has a partner k spaces ahead. If each strength difference is like a tension knot along an elastic string linking pairs, the elders desire to rearrange the beasts so that these knots are tightened as gently as could be, reducing the uncomfortable jolts between distant friends.\n\nYour quest in this narrative is two-fold: first, to comprehend the ritual of input where the elders specify the total number of monsters n and the bond distance k on one scroll, then provide the strengths of all the creatures in the exact order they currently stand on the next scroll. Each strength is a mighty integer, ranging from extremely weak to extraordinarily strong, capturing the gamut of power across the monster realm. Second, amidst the countless possible arrangements, your challenge is to discover the sequence that achieves the least possible total tension\u2014the smallest sum of differences across all pairs connected by the mystical bond distance. This is a race for optimal harmony, not mere order; for the elders want the gentlest evolution path.\n\nFor example, when the elders present three monsters bonded with a distance of two steps, having powers one, two, and four, one wise rearrangement might place the fighters as one, four, and then two. This rearrangement reduces the tension to just one, a far gentler pull than most alternative sequences. In another case where five creatures stand connected in pairs two apart with powers swinging like a pendulum\u2014three, minus five, three again, minus five once more, and then three\u2014the original line surprisingly brings zero strain, meaning it rests in perfect harmony without need of change. Lastly, six monsters with powers four, three, four, three, two, and five linked by a bond three steps apart find their best peace when arranged as two, three, four, four, three, and five, reducing the total tension to a mere three.\n\nThis lore teaches the importance of sense, balance, and order in the Monster Evolution realm. By rearranging powers wisely within the given bonds, one ensures that the connections between distant beasts remain as peaceful as possible. Your wisdom in unfolding this problem thus contributes to the legacy of harmony in this fantastic world where strength and bonds must gracefully coexist.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou've got array A, consisting of n integers and a positive integer k.

This is crucial for the optimization strategy.\n\n3. **Iterating and Calculating Strain:**\n   - The code iterates through all possible starting positions `i` for a group of `k` monsters.\n   - For each starting position `i`, it calculates the strain (`current_sum`) by summing the absolute differences between the strengths of monsters `i` steps apart.\n\n4. **Minimizing Strain:**\n   - The `min_sum` variable keeps track of the minimum strain encountered so far.\n   - After calculating the strain for each starting position, the code updates `min_sum` if a lower strain is found.\n\n5. **Output:**\n   - Finally, the code prints the `min_sum`, which represents the minimum possible total strain achievable by rearranging the monsters.\n\n**Why Sorting Helps:**\n\nSorting the monster strengths allows us to efficiently calculate the strain. By placing the monsters in order, we minimize the absolute differences between pairs separated by `k` steps. This is because the largest and smallest strengths will be furthest apart, leading to the smallest possible strain.\n\n\n\n",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the bustling grand city of Paradon, preparations were underway for the most spectacular festival parade the land had ever seen. The city square was a vast, perfectly square field, where every step east or north marked the boundary of the festival grounds, stretching widely\u2014thousands of steps from the southern gate to the northern plaza, and just as many from the eastern market to the western riverbank. This field was the heart of Paradon\u2019s celebration zone, where festival guards, robotic figures wrought for protection, could be strategically placed to watch over the revelry. Each guard took the form of a right-angled triangular sentinel, standing proud and precise, aligned carefully so that their legs ran either north-south or east-west across the cobblestones.\n\nThese special triangular sentinels came in one of four distinctive stances, each pivoting from a chosen corner stone in the parade grounds. The first stance faced the upper right corner, sweeping northeast along the square\u2019s grid; the second faced the lower right, watching towards the southeast; the third pointed up-left, guarding the northwest; and the fourth angled down-left, overseeing the southwest. Each sentinel\u2019s reach was decided by the length of their boundary legs\u2014like a triangle stretched proudly along the city\u2019s avenues\u2014with all corners firmly planted within the city limits, never stepping beyond the festive field\u2019s edge.\n\nAs the festival overseer, your task was twofold: commanded by the city's council, you must first accept orders to station these robot guards. Each order details exactly which stance the guard takes, where they set their corner stone, and how far their triangular watch reaches along the streets. Then, when curious visitors ask which guards watch over a particular lantern or banner post in the square, you must report exactly how many sentinels keep vigilant watch over that very spot\u2014whether the point lies inside a sentinel\u2019s triangle or on its very edge.\n\nTo begin, the city council announces the size of the parade grounds alongside the number of such instructions they will issue or questions they will ask. Each standing order or query comes in its own line: a command to place a sentinel includes the stance number, a precise coordinate inside the square, and the length of that sentinel\u2019s reach along the city\u2019s axes. A visitor\u2019s query simply specifies a single coordinate inside the square, awaiting the count of all guarding sentinels that encompass that point within their watchful triangles. After each visitor's query, you promptly respond with the number of sentinel guards stationed to protect that location.\n\nFor instance, imagine the parade field spans seventeen steps to a side, and the council issues ten commands or questions. One sentinel is instructed to face northeast from the corner stone at (3, 2) with a reach spanning four steps. Another faces northwest from (10, 3) with a longer reach of seven steps. A sentinel is placed southeast at (6, 8) with a two-step border, and yet another northwest sentinel stands at (9, 4) with two steps. When a visitor queries the point at (4, 4), you reveal that two sentinels cover that spot. Further orders arrange a sentinel southwest at (15, 10) reaching six steps. Questions for points like (7, 7), (9, 4), (12, 2), and (13, 8) yield answers of two, two, zero, and one respectively\u2014each breathing life into the city\u2019s protective dance.\n\nThus, immersed in the lively rhythm of Paradon\u2019s celebration, you must master the art of rapid placement and counting, ensuring that every step on the parade grounds is watched over by these geometric guardians as fully and efficiently as possible, guarding every festival moment in the spirit of joy, safety, and grand tradition.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nCompany \"Robots industries\" produces robots for territory protection. Robots protect triangle territories \u2014 right isosceles triangles with catheti parallel to North-South and East-West directions.\n\nOwner of some land buys and sets robots on his territory to protect it. From time to time, businessmen want to build offices on that land and want to know how many robots will guard it. You are to handle these queries.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains integer N \u2014 width and height of the land, and integer Q \u2014 number of queries to handle.\n\nNext Q lines contain queries you need to process.\n\nTwo types of queries:\n\n1. 1 dir x y len \u2014 add a robot to protect a triangle. Depending on the value of dir, the values of x, y and len represent a different triangle: dir = 1: Triangle is defined by the points (x, y), (x + len, y), (x, y + len) dir = 2: Triangle is defined by the points (x, y), (x + len, y), (x, y - len) dir = 3: Triangle is defined by the points (x, y), (x - len, y), (x, y + len) dir = 4: Triangle is defined by the points (x, y), (x - len, y), (x, y - len)\n2. 2 x y \u2014 output how many robots guard this point (robot guards a point if the point is inside or on the border of its triangle)\n\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 5000\n- 1 \u2264 Q \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 dir \u2264 4\n- All points of triangles are within range [1, N]\n- All numbers are positive integers\n\nOutput Format\nFor each second type query output how many robots guard this point. Each answer should be in a separate line.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n17 10\n1 1 3 2 4\n1 3 10 3 7\n1 2 6 8 2\n1 3 9 4 2\n2 4 4\n1 4 15 10 6\n2 7 7\n2 9 4\n2 12 2\n2 13 8\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n2\n2\n0\n1",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the bustling city of Glitchtopia, the grand Entertainment Event Flow Designer was entrusted with crafting sequences of performances to captivate the audience. The city mandated that each show must consist of exactly **N acts**, and every act must feature one of the first **M popular performers** from the legendary \"Alphabet Troupe,\" a troupe arranged by rank from 'a' upwards. The Designer obsessively zoomed in on a particular masterpiece show script called \"S,\" already a sequence of acts performed by these artists. This script's length was precisely **N**, and its acts were chosen among the first **M artists** to ensure top-tier quality.\n\nThe Designer\u2019s challenge was to conceive alternative performance sequences, called \"T,\" keeping favorite artists from the troupe but still varying the flow to keep the crowd on their toes. However, the twist was subtle yet deep: the Designer desired sequences \"T\" that were as close as possible to the original masterpiece \"S\" without being identical. Specifically, their measure of closeness was a legendary concept\u2014the length of the longest harmonious thread that two sequences shared, known in Glitchtopia as the Longest Common Harmony Chain (LCHC), which essentially parallels the longest common subsequence between two sequences onward. The goal was to find all sequences \"T\" of full length **N**\u2014crafted again from the first **M artists**\u2014such that the harmony between \"S\" and \"T\" was nearly perfect but subtly altered, one act shy from seamless identity. In other words, their harmonious string would be exactly **N minus one acts** long, just one act less than the ideal.\n\nThe task was framed in the following ritual: first, report the two primal numbers\u2014how many acts the show had and how many artists were allowed (both provided on the initial scroll). Then, on the subsequent scroll lay the original sequence \"S,\" the unalterable masterpiece. The Designer\u2019s quest was to count, as efficiently and extensively as possible, the total number of sequences \"T\" that met the near-perfection criterion\u2014each sequence spanning all **N** acts with acts chosen only among the first **M artists**, yet ensuring their longest harmonious thread with \"S\" faded by a single act. When the final count was declared, it was shared as a singular answer, the total tally, a reflection of how many such sequences could energize Glitchtopia\u2019s stages with whispers of familiarity amidst novelty.\n\nTo unwrap the enigma, consider these illustrations from the Designer\u2019s grand archive: A short show of 3 acts played by 3 different artists all named \u2018a\u2019 yields exactly 6 alternate sequences that strike the perfect near-harmony\u2014each differing by just one act\u2019s note, like 'aab' or 'caa.' Another example, a slightly varied 3-act script 'aab' with the same artists offers 11 such sequences, richer in variety but still bound by the one-act divergence rule. For the briefest show of a single act 'a' with just two artists, only a solo alternate exists: replacing that lone act with the other artist \u2018b.\u2019 Lastly, a more elaborate 10-act spectacle with nine artists beckoned exactly 789 such near-identical sequences, displaying the complexity and richness of the Designer\u2019s craft.\n\nThus, within this structured, exhilarating world of performance sequences and harmonious threads, the Designer\u2019s challenge was clear: given the cherished original sequence and the strict artist ranking rules, count all alternative sequences that maintain the harmony close to perfect, only one act shy of total identity. The final declaration of this count, a single number, would proclaim the extent of creative near-mirroring possible on Glitchtopia\u2019s grand stages.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a string S of length n with each character being one of the first m lowercase English letters.\n\nCalculate how many different strings T of length n composed from the first m lowercase English letters exist such that the length of LCS (longest common subsequence) between S and T is n - 1.\n\nRecall that LCS of two strings S and T is the longest string C such that C both in S and T as a subsequence.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m denoting the length of string S and number of first English lowercase characters forming the character set for strings (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 2 \u2264 m \u2264 26).\n\nThe second line contains string S.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the only line containing the answer.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 3\naaa\n\nSample Output 1\n\n6\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3 3\naab\n\nSample Output 2\n\n11\n\nSample Input 3\n\n1 2\na\n\nSample Output 3\n\n1\n\nSample Input 4\n\n10 9\nabacadefgh\n\nSample Output 4\n\n789\n\nNote\nFor the first sample, the 6 possible strings T are: aab, aac, aba, aca, baa, caa.\n\nFor the second sample, the 11 possible strings T are: aaa, aac, aba, abb, abc, aca, acb, baa, bab, caa, cab.\n\nFor the third sample, the only possible string T is b.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the shadowed halls of the Haunted Library, an ancient lexicon whispered prophecies in the language of bonds and burdens. This spectral tome contained the secrets of the Eldritch Web\u2014a sprawling connection of mystical nodes, each representing a point of arcane knowledge, joined by ethereal threads carrying weights of otherworldly gravity. The library masters knew there were **a grand number of these nodes**, somewhere up to two hundred thousand, and a similarly vast number of links\u2014just enough to weave a dense and connected tapestry that none could sever without unravelling the whole.\n\nThe custodians of these ancient wards decreed a strict rule: no node could be tethered to itself by its own ghostly thread, nor could any pair of nodes share more than a single bond. This maintained the purity of the spectral network, a reflection of the library\u2019s eternal order. Each bond whispered its own weight\u2014a numeric aura representing the effort required to traverse its ghostly path, ranging from the faintest shimmering whisper to a heavy, solemn toll beyond a billion spectral echoes. The mystical threads wove an undirected pattern, meaning their bonds were mutual, as if the library itself was a living, breathing entity binding knowledge in both directions.\n\nThe library's most cunning sorcerers were tasked with an arcane challenge: for every bond between two nodes in the Eldritch Web, they must discern the faintest ethereal path that still included this very bond, thereby maintaining the network's magical integrity. This was no trivial enchantment\u2014one must find a subset of the spectral threads that connected all nodes without breaking the sacred unity, and which bore the lightest possible cumulative weight, yet still featured the chosen thread. Such a mystical subset was known as a \"spanning incantation,\" a magical suture that bound the realms of knowledge with the least cost. The forbidden goal was not simply to keep the bond, but to illuminate the minimal sum of all thread burdens required to keep the entire tapestry tied without fraying.\n\nThe sorcerers prepared their scrolls with ritual precision. On the first line of their record was inscribed two grand numbers: the total count of nodes gleaming like cursed runes, and the tally of their connecting bonds\u2014each a triple of runic marks: the origins of the bond, the destination, and the weight of its spectral toll. Each bond was chronicled in the order it was discovered, a sacred numeration from the first to the last. Upon this, the sorcerers vowed to inscribe their revelations in parallel lines, each bearing the minimal sum of all burdens in the spanning incantation that embraced that very bond.\n\nOne such chapter recounted a mysterious weave of five nodes bound by seven bonds. The bonds bore mystical weights from a single spark to a solemn five-fold toll:\n\n- Between nodes one and two, a burden of three ghostly flames  \n- Between nodes one and three, a single flickering whisper  \n- Between nodes one and four, a heavy toll of five echoes  \n- Between nodes two and three, a mild burden of two shades  \n- Between nodes two and five, another burden of three ghosts  \n- Between nodes three and four, the weight of two flickering flames  \n- Between nodes four and five, a toll of four spectral echoes\n\nFrom this weaving, the incantations found their minimal sums for each bond: nine, eight, eleven, eight, eight, eight, and nine, respectively\u2014each line a silent chant revealing the faintest total burden that still embraced the bond.\n\nThus, the Eldritch Web remained forever bound, its spectral threads humming with knowledge and mystery, while every scholar of the Haunted Library could divine not just whether a bond existed, but the least costly spell to preserve its haunting connectivity throughout the arcane network.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nConnected undirected weighted graph without self-loops and multiple edges is given.

Each key in the dictionary is a node, and its value is a list of tuples representing its adjacent nodes and edge weights.\n\n3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**\n   - Implement the DSU data structure to efficiently track connected components in the graph.\n   - `parent`: An array to store the parent of each node in the DSU forest.\n   - `rank`: An array to store the rank (approximate height) of each tree in the forest.\n\n4. **Sorting Edges:**\n   - Sort the `edges` list in ascending order of edge weights using `edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])`.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the grand hall of the kingdom's courthouse, a curious case unfolds before the masterful Judge Logica, where the world is laid out not by hearsay but by the rigid grid of truth\u2014an infinite checkerboard extending beyond the eye\u2019s grasp. Upon this vast white expanse, the plaintiff, Lady Vika, claims she has cast numerous bands of ebony lines\u2014precise and purposeful\u2014across this endless plane. These bands are no ordinary strokes: each is a rigidly straight line of squares joined horizontally or vertically, akin to royal banners marching in perfect alignment along the rows or columns of the kingdom\u2019s grid. Lady Vika\u2019s mark-making respects the code of the realm: every banner occupies exactly one uninterrupted row or column, spanning from one noble coordinate to another without deviation.\n\nNow, the law requires clarity on the kingdom\u2019s canvas: amidst the many bands Lady Vika has drawn, some may cross paths, overlap entirely, or brush edges in solemn union. Her challenge\u2014and the court\u2019s charge\u2014is to determine how many unique tiles of the kingdom's grid bear the stamp of her noble banners. The kingdom\u2019s edicts insist that each marked tile, no matter how many banners may cover it, counts but once to the tally. It is a question not merely of spotting the blackened tiles but of counting them fully and faithfully, leaving no square unaccounted nor recounted.\n\nThe investigation proceeds with a formal decree. First, the kingdom provides the number of given banners, a count no smaller than one and no greater than one hundred thousand\u2014enough for grand designs but bounded to keep the court\u2019s calculations from spiraling into endless complexity. Then, for each banner, the court is presented with the coordinates of its endpoints\u2014four plainly spoken numbers describing the start and end positions upon the infinite chessboard. These coordinates carry weight as grand as negative and positive billions in measure, ensuring banners can stretch wide or shrink small, anywhere within the kingdom\u2019s boundless grid. All banners stand strictly aligned, never leaning diagonally or wavering from their true path.\n\nThe court\u2019s duty is to discern, from this multitude of banners, how many unique squares have felt the black touch of Lady Vika\u2019s artistry. Every square touched by any banner is summoned once to the final count, regardless of overlaps or repeated passage by multiple banners. Thus, the court seeks to deliver justice not merely in identification, but in comprehensive and efficient reckoning, acknowledging each square and only once.\n\nTo illuminate her claim, Lady Vika offers examples to the court. In one instance, three banners claim the land\u2014with lines stretching across three rows and columns, some crossing and others aligned. The final decree reveals precisely eight unique marked squares. In another, four bold banners frame a square fortress, covering sixteen squares fully without overlap. Each is enumerated by the court with clarity, confirming the exact spread of darkened tiles upon the kingdom's eternal grid. With these examples, the court is guided towards a verdict: to determine the full expanse Lady Vika's lines cover, counting each square once, in the grand ledger of the realm.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nVika has an infinite sheet of squared paper. Initially all squares are white. She introduced a two-dimensional coordinate system on this sheet and drew n black horizontal and vertical segments parallel to the coordinate axes. All segments have width equal to 1 square, that means every segment occupy some set of neighbouring squares situated in one row or one column.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of painted cells.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the bustling realm of Eldoria, there stood a legendary inn known as The Prime Hearth, famed not only for its cozy fires and hearty stews but also for an ancient ledger that held secrets whispered only among the wisest patrons. This ledger recorded not just ordinary numbers, but enchanted values crafted from the very essence of prime spirits. One day, Ayrat, a determined adventurer and scholar, arrived at the inn carrying a peculiar number\u2014an enchanted construct made by binding together several prime spirits, each a mystical entity with its own unique power.\n\nIn Eldoria\u2019s arcane arithmetic, any number's soul was woven through its prime spirits, listed in the ledger as a sequence of these prime entities\u2019 names, with some spirits recurring more than once like echoes in a chant. The ledger\u2019s tome instructed that the \u201cpassword to the secret vault\u201d within the inn\u2019s cellar was hidden in the enchanted product formed by considering every divisor of Ayrat\u2019s number. These divisors could be thought of as all possible combinations of the prime spirits chosen from Ayrat\u2019s collection, including the humble \u201cone\u201d spirit reflecting the empty choice. The final spell required the multiplication of all these divisors\u2019 powers followed by a mystical binding spell that confined the number within the bounds of an enchanted lock, whose magic was set to the prime value just over one billion plus seven\u2014a sacred constant revered throughout Eldoria to keep numbers from growing beyond control.\n\nAyrat\u2019s challenge was clear yet daunting: the ledger presented, on the first sacred parchment, a single integer representing how many prime spirits were intertwined to form the number\u2019s essence\u2014this could be as many as two hundred thousand, reflecting an immense complexity. On the next scroll lay the list of these primes, each ranging from the humble two to well beyond into the hundreds of thousands, a collection both vast and cryptic. Ayrat's quest was not merely to identify the product of all divisors but to do so efficiently, leveraging the harmony of Eldorian magic to reduce the grand multiplication into manageable enchantments modulo the sacred prime lock. The goal was to unlock the vault\u2019s secret that would reveal all hidden wisdom stored beneath The Prime Hearth.\n\nTo accomplish this, Ayrat would first gather the count of each prime spirit\u2019s frequency, for the number\u2019s true identity in Eldoria came from how many times each prime spirit appeared in the weave. With these counts, he could then summon the total number of divisors\u2014each divisor corresponding to selection of powers of the prime spirits. Taking this deeper, the product of all divisors obeyed a special arcane formula: the original number, raised to the power of half the total count of divisors. This subtle insight allowed him to transform a seemingly impossible calculation into a singular, elegant enchantment. Finally, the recipe demanded the result be whispered modulo the sacred prime lock to yield the password that cracked the vault\u2019s formidable seal.\n\nFor instance, when Ayrat brought forth a number woven from just two prime spirits\u2014one bearing the power of two and the other three\u2014the total number was their product: six. The divisors in this case were one, two, three, and six themselves. Multiplying these gave thirty-six, which under the sacred lock\u2019s magic remained thirty-six, revealing the password deeply embedded in the simplicity of the number\u2019s nature. On a more complex parchment, a number woven from three spirits\u2014two, three, and another two\u2014formed a grander number, twelve. Its divisors included one, two, three, four, six, and twelve, their product remarkably sixteenth-fold their original essence, resulting in a password of one thousand seven hundred twenty-eight under the same ancient magic.\n\nThus, Ayrat\u2019s journey through the arcane ledger of The Prime Hearth was not just a mathematical trial but a dance of mystical insight and deep understanding of the enchanted prime spirits. The records he made not only unlocked the secret vault but deepened the lore of Eldoria, where numbers and magic entwined in perfect harmony to reveal the universe\u2019s hidden codes.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nAyrat has number n, represented as it's prime factorization pi of size m, i.e. n = p1\u00b7p2\u00b7...\u00b7pm. Ayrat got secret information that that the product of all divisors of n taken modulo 109 + 7 is the password to the secret data base. Now he wants to calculate this value.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of primes in factorization of n.\n\nThe second line contains m primes numbers pi (2 \u2264 pi \u2264 200 000).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 the product of all divisors of n modulo 109 + 7.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n2\n2 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n36\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3\n2 3 2\n\nSample Output 2\n\n1728\n\nNote\nIn the first sample n = 2\u00b73 = 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6, their product is equal to 1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b76 = 36.\n\nIn the second sample 2\u00b73\u00b72 = 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12. 1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74\u00b76\u00b712 = 1728.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the far reaches of the Staravian Empire, a flourishing cluster of colonies thrived under the watchful eyes of the Galactic Council. Among these colonies, each one preserved a collection of ancient data scrolls\u2014sequences of encoded runes believed to hold the secrets of prosperity and knowledge. Each colony\u2019s archive was known not just for its content, but for the value the Galactic Council assigned to it, a measure reflecting the colony\u2019s strategic importance. This value varied widely, sometimes being a boon and other times a burden, dependent on how the runes influenced the greater cosmic balance.\n\nThe Council\u2019s chief task was to find a mystical sequence of runes\u2014referred to only as the \u201cSignature Cipher\u201d\u2014which when aligned with the scrolls' contents, could maximize the Empire\u2019s collective fortune. The power of any chosen cipher was determined by multiplying its length by how many times it appeared within each scroll, weighted by that scroll\u2019s importance. Importantly, the Signature Cipher need not be a direct copy of any archive sequence; it could be a newly crafted rune pattern forged from scratch. Still, the Council\u2019s rules bound the problem: with many thousands of scrolls\u2014up to a hundred thousand\u2014and the combined length of all scrolls not exceeding five hundred thousand runes, the cipher had to be discovered with both care and efficiency.\n\nIn practice, the Council received a list of all scrolls\u2014for each, the exact sequence of its runes was recorded, each scroll line following another in the manifest. Afterward, the value of each scroll was declared, a series of integers given in full on a single line after the scroll records. The task was stern and urgent: to find the Signature Cipher that, when considered alongside every scroll\u2019s content and value, gave the highest possible total power. This total was the sum over all scrolls of the cipher\u2019s appearances within that scroll, multiplied by the scroll\u2019s value, then multiplied by the cipher\u2019s length. The realm hung on the precision of this magical calculation, given that scroll values could be as high as ten million or as low as negative ten million, and the cipher\u2019s strength could either be a great boon or a haunting liability.\n\nOnce the Council received the inputs \u2014 the number of scrolls, each runic sequence in its own line, and then the stream of scroll values on one final line \u2014 a master scribe was tasked with conjuring the perfect cipher. Their goal was not merely to find a convenient rune string but to reach the maximum power achievable, harnessing all knowledge and resources of the Empire. This meant the cipher had to be carefully evaluated against every colony\u2019s runes to count its occurrences, multiplied by the scroll\u2019s weight, and then magnified by the cipher\u2019s own length. The magic was in finding that delicate balance where the cipher\u2019s length and frequency across the archives wove together to outshine every other possibility.\n\nTo illustrate, the Council considered a simple case of two scrolls: one displaying the twin runes \u201caa\u201d and the other \u201cbb\u201d, assigned values two and one respectively. The best Signature Cipher here was \u201caa\u201d, which shimmered within the first scroll twice and not at all in the second, producing an ultimate power of four\u2014achieved by multiplying its length two, with the scroll\u2019s value two, summed for that scroll alone. In a subtler scenario, with two scrolls \u201caa\u201d and \u201cab\u201d and values two and one respectively, a new cipher \u201ca\u201d yielded the supreme power of five. This rune appeared twice in the first scroll and once in the second, and despite its shorter length, its frequent appearance across valuable scrolls pushed the power higher than any longer or less frequent pattern.\n\nThus, from the cryptic depths of starry libraries, the Galactic Council unites the fragments of scattered knowledge, transforming scattered scrolls and their values into the purest Signature Cipher, maximizing the wisdom and strength of the Staravian Empire\u2019s storied legacy.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given n strings ti.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\n**Survival Log #237: The Code of the XOR Tribes**\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse, the remnants of humanity cluster within scattered enclaves, each governed by strange rituals born of necessity and coded hope. Among these, a group called the XOR Tribes emerged, worshipping a secret number\u2014simply known as the Chosen One. This mystical number governs their fate and the balance of power in their domain, a ruined digital grid stretching through what remains of the wasteland.\n\nThe XOR Tribes believe that every length of the ancient Path of Values is woven with codes\u2014each segment hides a secret when its elements, when combined in the sacred way of exclusive or, reveal the Chosen One. The elders hold a scroll listing these ancient values, a long numbered sequence carved once into rusted metal plates, of length no more than a hundred thousand. The Chosen One, that elusive number, is never greater than one million, born from the fragments of lost machines. Warriors and scholars alike must query this scroll, choosing segments by their starting and ending markers\u2014marker numbers always lying within the bounds of the great sequence. The challenge is to find how many secret pairs of positions exist within each chosen segment, such that when their paths\u2019 values are XORed together, the result speaks the Chosen One\u2019s number.\n\nThe system asks you, the survivor and seeker, to interpret their language: first, you read the length of the scroll, the number of queries from warriors, and the Chosen One\u2019s sacred number, all as three integers in one line. Next, you unroll the ancient sequence\u2014each element a glyph, itself a number from zero up to one million, written side by side on the next line. Finally come the queries, each on their own line, expressed as two numbers chronicling the beginning and the end of the segment to investigate\u2014always legal markers in the start-to-end boundary of the scroll. Your task is to examine these segments and tell the warriors how many pairs of positions within the segment, stretching from start to end and anywhere inside, reveal the Chosen One when their path values are combined through the XOR chant. This is not merely about finding one or two secrets\u2014it\u2019s about uncovering every possible pair efficiently, within the limited time and space the wasteland affords.\n\nTo illustrate with a few memories logged by the elders: in one record, a scroll of length six held the values one, two, one, one, zero, and three. The Chosen One for their quest was three. The warriors brought forth two challenges: one spanning the entire scroll, and another just a portion near the middle. When counted, they found exactly seven secret pairs of positions in the full stretch that revealed the number three through their XOR whispers, yet none in the smaller segment whispered the Chosen One\u2019s truth. Another memory detailed a shorter scroll of five ones, seeking a Chosen One of one. Warriors inspecting segments of varying lengths uncovered many pairs, including odd-length spells forming the chorus of the XOR chant.\n\nThe survivors know this secret well: each answer, the number of revealing pairs for the query segments, must be printed on its own line, in the order the queries came, so the warriors may act upon the knowledge swiftly. In living by this code, the XOR Tribes edge closer to survival\u2014and perhaps, to rebirth amid the ruins.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nBob has a favorite number k and ai of length n. Now he asks you to answer m queries. Each query is given by a pair li and ri and asks you to count the number of pairs of integers i and j, such that l \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 r and the xor of the numbers ai, ai + 1, ..., aj is equal to k.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains integers n, m and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100 000, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 1 000 000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array, the number of queries and Bob's favorite number respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers ai (0 \u2264 ai \u2264 1 000 000)\u00a0\u2014 Bob's array.\n\nThen m lines follow. The i-th line contains integers li and ri (1 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264 n)\u00a0\u2014 the parameters of the i-th query.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint m lines, answer the queries in the order they appear in the input.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n6 2 3\n1 2 1 1 0 3\n1 6\n3 5\n\nSample Output 1\n\n7\n0\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5 3 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 5\n2 4\n1 3\n\nSample Output 2\n\n9\n4\n4\n\nNote\nIn the first sample the suitable pairs of i and j for the first query are: (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (3, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6). Not a single of these pairs is suitable for the second query.\n\nIn the second sample xor equals 1 for all subarrays of an odd length.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nAfter a mighty storm wrecked their ship, Resha and her close companions, Kerim and Gural, found themselves stranded on a vast, seemingly endless island adorned with a great ancient tree known among the islanders as the New Year Tree. This tree was unlike any other\u2014it had many great limbs branching outward, all connected in a harmonious web with one grand trunk at its heart, known as the Root limb. Each branch segment sparkled with vibrant colors, whispers of the island's spirit, and intriguing mysteries about its aura and power.\n\nAmong the island's elders, a wise council declared a challenge for Resha and her friends: the tree\u2019s colors could be changed by the careful touch of the three friends but only under strict laws. The tree was divided into special segments called \"subtrees,\" each identified by a branch segment, and any changes made to one segment would affect all branches downstream from that point. Resha could command the recoloring of these segments, but the magic only allowed uniform color changes across the chosen branch and all its subordinate branches. Colors were confined to a sacred set of sixty hues. Alternatively, she could inquire about the variety of colors present within any segment, seeking to know how many unique hues adorned that portion of the tree. This spell of color-changing and color-counting could be performed many times\u2014up to several hundred thousand\u2014leaving the trio to navigate these operations promptly and with great wisdom.\n\nTheir task was twofold: to manipulate the colors of any segment and all its descendants to a single chosen hue, or to report with clarity the richness of colors within any chosen segment. The complexity grew with the size of the tree, which stretched from a single branch to as many as 400,000 connected parts, each glowing in some hue. The ancient scripts given by the elder council listed the initial hues of each branch, the exact interconnections of the limbs, and then a series of commands : either recoloring commands specifying a limb and a hue, or queries about hue diversity in a given limb\u2019s subtree. Resha and her friends needed to perform these operations in order, ensuring swift updates and bold, accurate reports.\n\nThe council\u2019s scripts were precise. On the first line, there were two numbers: the first told the number of limbs the New Year Tree held, the second told how many commands would be carried out on these limbs. The next line described the initial color of each limb by listing as many numbers as there were limbs, each number a sacred hue identifier up to sixty. Then for each of the several limbs minus one (making the whole tree connected without cycles), a pair of numbers detailed how two limbs were joined \u2014 an undirected link meaning the branches intertwined symbiotically. Following this, the commands came, each beginning with a number to signify its nature: one meant recoloring a subtree starting at a certain limb with a single hue; two meant counting the diversity of hues in the subtree starting at the specified limb. The output was expected as a series of lines, each reporting the count of unique colors after corresponding queries of the second type.\n\nTo illustrate, in one tale the tree held seven limbs with all limbs initially glowing with the same single hue. Through a series of ten vibrant ceremonies involving both recoloring whole subtrees and asking for the spectrum count beneath certain limbs, the friends discovered varying numbers of colors in these segments: sometimes two hues, sometimes three, up to five, until the scheme narrowed back down to just one or two hues depending on the latest magical brush strokes they painted across the tree.\n\nIn a grander saga, the tree was a vast tapestry with 23 limbs of multiple different initial colors. Through thirty ritual commands, the friends altered segments and queried the diversity repeatedly. They saw moments when the subtree beneath the root shimmered with six unique hues yet later was simplified to a single hue, mirroring the ebb and flow of the island\u2019s magic and their careful adjustments.\n\nThus, the contest set by the elder council required mastery of balance\u2014transforming colors unifiedly across many limbs, yet quickly detecting the richness of hues woven beneath any chosen limb. Each command, like a spell cast in order, shaped the great tree\u2019s spirit, echoing through the island\u2019s heart, and testing Resha, Kerim, and Gural\u2019s wisdom in tending this sacred New Year Tree far beyond the end of the holiday season.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nThe New Year holidays are over, but Resha doesn't want to throw away the New Year tree. He invited his best friends Kerim and Gural to help him to redecorate the New Year tree.\n\nThe New Year tree is an undirected tree with n vertices and root in the vertex 1.\n\nYou should process the queries of the two types:\n\n1. Change the colours of all vertices in the subtree of the vertex v to the colour c.\n2. Find the number of different colours in the subtree of the vertex v.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 4\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree and the number of the queries.\n\nThe second line contains n integers ci (1 \u2264 ci \u2264 60) \u2014 the colour of the i-th vertex.\n\nEach of the next n - 1 lines contains two integers xj, yj (1 \u2264 xj, yj \u2264 n) \u2014 the vertices of the j-th edge. It is guaranteed that you are given correct undirected tree.\n\nThe last m lines contains the description of the queries. Each description starts with the integer tk (1 \u2264 tk \u2264 2) \u2014 the type of the k-th query. For the queries of the first type then follows two integers vk, ck (1 \u2264 vk \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 ck \u2264 60) \u2014 the number of the vertex whose subtree will be recoloured with the colour ck. For the queries of the second type then follows integer vk (1 \u2264 vk \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of the vertex for which subtree you should find the number of different colours.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each query of the second type print the integer a \u2014 the number of different colours in the subtree of the vertex given in the query.\n\nEach of the numbers should be printed on a separate line in order of query appearing in the input.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n7 10\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n3 5\n3 6\n3 7\n1 3 2\n2 1\n1 4 3\n2 1\n1 2 5\n2 1\n1 6 4\n2 1\n2 2\n2 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n1\n2\n\nSample Input 2\n\n23 30\n1 2 2 6 5 3 2 1 1 1 2 4 5 3 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 4 6\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 5\n2 6\n3 7\n3 8\n4 9\n4 10\n4 11\n6 12\n6 13\n7 14\n7 15\n7 16\n8 17\n8 18\n10 19\n10 20\n10 21\n11 22\n11 23\n2 1\n2 5\n2 6\n2 7\n2 8\n2 9\n2 10\n2 11\n2 4\n1 12 1\n1 13 1\n1 14 1\n1 15 1\n1 16 1\n1 17 1\n1 18 1\n1 19 1\n1 20 1\n1 21 1\n1 22 1\n1 23 1\n2 1\n2 5\n2 6\n2 7\n2 8\n2 9\n2 10\n2 11\n2 4\n\nSample Output 2\n\n6\n1\n3\n3\n2\n1\n2\n3\n5\n5\n1\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n2\n3",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the winding expanse of the Shifting Labyrinth, there exists a mystical corridor lined with a sequence of ancient stones, each etched with a glowing numeral. These stones, numbering no more than fifty thousand, form the labyrinth\u2019s pulse\u2014an endless river of cryptic power that whispers secrets of hidden strength. Along this corridor, seekers present their challenges\u2014precise requests that ask to explore particular stretches of the stones, seeking to unveil the greatest magical resonance hidden among them.\n\nThe labyrinth itself obeys a strange arithmetic: between any two stones within a chosen segment, one can invoke the XOR Harmony\u2014a mysterious force kindled by \u201cweaving\u201d the energies of all integers from the number on the first stone up to the number on the second, inclusively. But this harmony is only granted when the number on the first stone is no greater than that on the second, and the indices of these stones lie within the seeker\u2019s requested boundaries. It is from these bounds and conditions that the seekers desire a paramount revelation: the maximal value of this XOR Harmony, achievable from any pair of stones whose numbers respect the natural ascending order within the segment they specify.\n\nTo task the labyrinth\u2019s ancient mystics, the seekers offer first the dimensions of their challenge\u2014the length of the stones\u2019 sequence and the count of their inquiries. On the next line, they inscribe each glowing numeral from stone to stone, painting a full portrait of the corridor\u2019s numerical tapestry. Following this, for each challenge, a pair of positions is invoked, representing the segment from the corridor\u2019s start and end stone within which the seeker gazes. For each pair, the ancient minds deliver a single line of output: the highest resonance summoned by applying the XOR Harmony between any valid pair of stones in the segment, honoring the natural order of their engraved numbers.\n\nTo illuminate the mysteries, stories of the labyrinth\u2019s past trials serve as guides:\n\nIn one tale, six stones stretch before a seeker with three challenges. The numbers pulse steadily from one through six. Whenever the seeker peers across the entire span, or within smaller windows, the greatest XOR Harmony they can evoke is seven\u2014a number whispered by the winds of the labyrinth as the peak of such ranges.\n\nAnother seeks the truth in a corridor of solitary stone, bearing the number one. The answer is thus simple and singular: the resonance is exactly that, one.\n\nIn a more complex saga, a sequence of six mystic stones displays a wild variety of numbers. Twenty inquiries test every possible substring, from single stones to vast stretches spanning the corridor\u2019s breadth. Each quest reveals the unique culmination of the XOR Harmony, ranging from the direct power inscribed on a stone to compounded resonances across stones\u2019 mixtures \u2014 always the greatest achievable within the given bounds and order.\n\nThus, the chronicles remain open, inviting seekers to cast their queries upon the labyrinth\u2019s numeric tapestry, and in turn, receive the grandest harmony that can be summoned from the forge of ordered stones within their chosen segments\u2014the ancient challenge ever balanced between conditions, bounds, and the labyrinth\u2019s cryptic logic.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array with n integers ai and m queries.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\n**Parallel Universe Synchronization Log: The Chronicles of the Infinite Bazaar**\n\nIn the entwined realities of the Multiverse Exchange, there existed an extraordinary emporium known simply as the Infinite Bazaar. Within its sprawling halls were countless kinds of mystical artifacts, each shimmering with a unique intrinsic essence that defined its worth. These essences were inscribed as ancient runes, with a grand total of N unique varieties pulsing through the very air; yet, for each variety, there were inexhaustible amounts available to peruse and take. Among the many travelers through realms, one particularly sly figure\u2014a thief\u2014carried a legendary sack, enchanted by the Arcane Guild to hold exactly K artifacts, no more, no less. The thief\u2019s mission? To fill this enchanted sack with a precise quantity of these artifacts.\n\nThe rules of this multiversal market were weirdly strict but elegant: the thief\u2019s enchanted sack could not hold fewer or greater than exactly K items, irrespective of which kinds they came from. The thief could pick repeats of the same variety as often as desired, as the infinity of stock allowed infinite repeats of each flavor of artifact. Each kind of artifact bore an aura that, when pocketed, imposed a certain fixed cost translated from the runic inscriptions. This cost was unique to the kind but constant per single token snatched. Every artifact\u2019s individual worth was a positive integer\u2014not beyond the greatest runic value whispered throughout the realms, climbing to about a thousand. Given these runes, the thief intended to uncover every feasible combined worth\u2014the sum of the worths of exactly K chosen artifacts\u2014that the sack could yield, exploring the bounds of magical economy as efficiently as possible.\n\nTo aid synchronization across universes, the thief\u2019s log demanded an explicit report of all the possible total costs attainable by filling the sack exactly with K artifacts. The initial line of this interdimensional report would declare the number of artifact kinds and the exact number the sack must hold, both integers no smaller than one and never outnumbering a thousand\u2014capturing the delicate balance necessary for harmony in the Infinite Bazaar. Next, on a single following line, the worths of the N artifact kinds were inscribed as integers, each echoing between one and one thousand, each a testament to the preciousness of that artifact kind.\n\nThe final step of this ritualistic documentation was to send the list of every possible total combined worth, arranged ascendingly in a gracefully ordered sequence. These sums must be separated by a space like shining stars on a smooth black canvas, painting the true spectrum of wealth the thief could clutch from this infinite treasure trove.\n\nAs an example from the archives: when three distinct artifacts bore individual worth values of one, two, and three, and the thief\u2019s sack could hold exactly two, the thief\u2019s report revealed all achievable totals from two to six\u2014clearly mapping all the attainable magical totals. In another log, when five types all radiated the same humble worth of one and the sack was to hold five, a single number stood triumphant: five, the straightforward sum of five identical minor artifacts. Lastly, a more cryptic entry documented when three artifact types held worths of three, five, and eleven with exact sacks of three, the list expanded broadly, showing a vibrant spread of possible totals from nine up to thirty-three, encoding the complexity of mixed possibilities.\n\nThus closed this entry in the Synchronization Log, a tale of infinite choice constrained by exact count, revealing the endless configurations of artifacts and their combined sacred costs within the Infinite Bazaar.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nA thief made his way to a shop.\n\nAs usual he has his lucky knapsack with him. The knapsack can contain k objects. There are n kinds of products in the shop and an infinite number of products of each kind. The cost of one product of kind i is ai.\n\nThe thief is greedy, so he will take exactly k products (it's possible for some kinds to take several products of that kind).\n\nFind all the possible total costs of products the thief can nick into his knapsack.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n, k \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of kinds of products and the number of products the thief will take.\n\nThe second line contains n integers ai (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 1000) \u2014 the costs of products for kinds from 1 to n.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the only line with all the possible total costs of stolen products, separated by a space. The numbers should be printed in the ascending order.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 2\n1 2 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2 3 4 5 6\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5 5\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nSample Output 2\n\n5\n\nSample Input 3\n\n3 3\n3 5 11\n\nSample Output 3\n\n9 11 13 15 17 19 21 25 27 33",

        "question_title": "Fibonacci-ish",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the delicate world of clockmaking, Yash, a young artisan fascinated by intricate patterns, has recently become enchanted with the mysterious rhythm of the Fibonacci sequence. Within his workshop, sequences of numbers behave much like the precise gears of his clocks: each number fits into a grander scheme. Yash defines a special kind of sequence, which he calls \"Fibonacci-ish,\" where the dance of the numbers follows a unique harmony. This harmony requires the sequence to have at least two numbers, with the first two freely chosen as any values from his collection, but thereafter, every number must be the sum of the two numbers that just preceded it. Such a sequence resembles the ticking pulse of a well-crafted clock, where each click depends on the previous two.\n\nIn this clockmaker\u2019s society, the numbers are precious parts found scattered in a jumble, and Yash faces a challenge. He begins with a collection of these number-parts, each bearing their own size and weight\u2014some possibly negative, like decrepit cogs diminished over time. He wants to rearrange these parts along a single line so that the longest possible initial chain (prefix) follows the Fibonacci-ish rhythm perfectly. His rule is clear: the sequence must start strong with any two parts, then every subsequent part in the lineup must be the sum of its two immediate predecessors, exactly like the gears in his clocks interlocking to keep flawless time.\n\nYash\u2019s problem is posed as such: first, he knows how many parts there are in total, a number never less than two but never exceeding a thousand. These parts can range from very tiny to very large, and some might even feel like they pull the entire structure backward. On the next line, Yash lists these parts by their individual sizes, which may range from somewhat tiny to enormous, even negative values included. His task is to arrange these parts in a line such that the initial run\u2014the prefix starting from the first part\u2014follows the Fibonacci-ish rule for as many parts as possible. The goal is not merely to meet the condition but to maximize the length of this harmonious prefix, as if striving to make his clock tick longer with each perfect turn.\n\nThe input to this problem, written in the clockmaker\u2019s notation, first mentions the count of parts in a single line. On the very next line, the sizes of each part follow, each separated by space as if laid neatly for inspection. What Yash must produce\u2014the output\u2014is simply a single number: how many of these parts he can line up at the start so that their sizes conform to the Fibonacci-ish relationship, after he rearranges them in whatever order best serves this cause.\n\nConsider when Yash began with three parts sized one, two, and minus one. By repositioning them to one, two, and then one again, he finds the parts fall in perfect Fibonacci-ish order\u2014the entire sequence ticks beautifully. In another scenario, he has five parts\u2014twenty-eight, thirty-five, seven, fourteen, and twenty-one. Reordering to seven, fourteen, twenty-one, thirty-five creates a prefix four parts long that behaves according to the Fibonacci-ish rules; the fifth part disrupts the rhythm. These examples reveal Yash's clockmaking mastery in selecting and ordering parts to extend the perfect ticking prefix, ensuring his watches are not only crafted but tuned to the perfect Fibonacci beat.\n\nThus, Yash\u2019s routine notebook records this subtle quest: given a scattered set of parts, rearrange them so the longest initial sequence resonates as a Fibonacci-ish melody, and return how many parts in that melody endure. His journey is one of precision, patience, and a beautiful understanding of numerical harmony, crafted within the ticking heart of his workshop.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYash has recently learnt about the Fibonacci sequence and is very excited about it. He calls a sequence Fibonacci-ish if\n\n1. the sequence consists of at least two elements\n2. f0 and f1 are arbitrary\n3. fn + 2 = fn + 1 + fn for all n \u2265 0.\n\nYou are given some sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an. Your task is rearrange elements of this sequence in such a way that its longest possible prefix is Fibonacci-ish sequence.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 1000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the sequence ai.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (|ai| \u2264 109).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the length of the longest possible Fibonacci-ish prefix of the given sequence after rearrangement.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n1 2 -1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5\n28 35 7 14 21\n\nSample Output 2\n\n4\n\nNote\nIn the first sample, if we rearrange elements of the sequence as - 1, 2, 1, the whole sequence ai would be Fibonacci-ish.\n\nIn the second sample, the optimal way to rearrange elements is 7, 14, 21, 35, 28.",

After the original *k* members inaugurate the clique, each additional member\u2019s entry is detailed in a dossier. For each such recruit, the dossier lists exactly *k* existing agents, all of whom are fully connected amongst themselves, forming a secure *k*-sized clique. This ensures that every new operative forms tight bonds with a trusted subset of the network, preserving the clique lineage. No agent joins alone or with half-trusted contacts\u2014they always attach themselves to a flawless small inner circle.\n\n*Task Explanation:*  \n\nArtem\u2019s mission: unravel the complexity of this network by calculating the number of spanning trees that cover all agents, an essential quantity that reflects the number of ways information or commands can propagate through the entire group without loops and without leaving anyone disconnected. This number is sought modulo a large prime lightly cloaked for digital stability\u2014one billion and seven\u2014a common constant in cryptography and coding challenges. The goal is not merely to find any spanning tree but to count all possible unique minimal connection patterns so that communication within this complex network could be guaranteed under many configurations.\n\n*Input Transmission:*  \n\nArtem receives the briefing in a precise format. First, a single line appears containing two integers separated by a space: the total number of agents in the network, followed by the clique size at the origin of this graph\u2014the size of the original secret circle. Immediately following this, the dossier entries start arriving for each new recruit. Each line contains the exact *k* existing agent marks (each a number less than the recruit's own identifier) that the newcomer will connect to. These indices form a trusted secret clique; no mistrust here.\n\n*Output Transmission:*  \n\nThe final intel report Artem must submit is succinct: one single integer, encrypted in the modulo world of one billion and seven, denoting the number of possible spanning trees covering the entire network of *n* agents.\n\n*Examples and Closing:*  \n\nAs a demonstration, Artem tests a simple network: with three agents total and an initial clique of size two, the third member connects to these original two agents. The network\u2019s total spanning trees count wraps up to three under the modulo cloak. In a slightly more complex setup, four agents with an initial triangle of three form the clique. The fourth agent links up with all three original agents, resulting in a grand total of sixteen spanning trees possible.\n\nArtem logs the success, knowing these counts encapsulate the robust complexity of his secret network\u2019s connectivity, where every new operative both strengthens and complicates the underground web of trust.\n\n---\n\n**Sample Entry #1:**  \nLine One: \"3 2\" \u2014 a network of three agents, starting with a pair clan.  \nLine Two: \"1 2\" \u2014 third agent connects to agents one and two.  \n*Output:* 3\n\n**Sample Entry #2:**  \nLine One: \"4 3\" \u2014 four agents total, with a secret triad seed.  \nLine Two: \"1 2 3\" \u2014 the fourth agent links to the entire initial clique.  \n*Output:* 16\n\nThus, the underground network's strength and resilience are quantified, one spanning tree count at a time.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nLittle Artem is given a graph, constructed as follows: start with some k-clique, then add new vertices one by one, connecting them to k already existing vertices that form a k-clique.\n\nArtem wants to count the number of spanning trees in this graph modulo 109 + 7.\n\nInput Format\nFirst line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10 000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 min(n, 5))\u00a0\u2014 the total size of the graph and the size of the initial clique, respectively.\n\nNext n - k lines describe k + 1-th, k + 2-th, ..., i-th, ..., n-th vertices by listing k distinct vertex indices 1 \u2264 aij < i it is connected to. It is guaranteed that those vertices form a k-clique.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of spanning trees in the given graph modulo 109 + 7.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 2\n1 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3\n\nSample Input 2\n\n4 3\n1 2 3\n\nSample Output 2\n\n16",

This code uses a recursive approach to calculate the spanning trees based on Kirchhoff's Theorem.\n\n4. **Recursive Calculation:**\n   - The `calculate_spanning_trees()` function recursively explores the graph, starting from a given node.\n   - It marks the current node as visited and iterates through its neighbors.\n   - For each unvisited neighbor, it recursively calls itself to calculate the number of spanning trees rooted at that neighbor.\n   - The results from all neighbors are summed up to get the total number of spanning trees reachable from the current node.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   - The code iterates through each node in the graph and calls `calculate_spanning_trees()` to get the number of spanning trees rooted at that node.\n   - The sum of these counts represents the total number of spanning trees in the graph.\n\n6. **Modulo Operation:**\n   - The final result is taken modulo `10**9 + 7` to handle potential integer overflows and comply with the problem's requirement.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\n"

These beings manifest as streams of shimmering stones, each stone glowing with a hue numbered from the cosmic palette of colors, specially numbered from one up to a great celestial limit. The length of each stream, a sacred ritual count, is known as the legion size. The greatest number in their color palette symbolizes the vast diversity possible in a guardian's composition.\n\nWithin the containment protocols of this zoo, the Guardians\u2019 most treasured feature is their unique patternings\u2014each stream\u2019s distinct subsequences, which represent the intricate echoes of their existence. These echoes include the silent emptiness as well, revered for their foundational essence. Each subsequence is a selection of stones in order, yet not necessarily adjacent, capturing the Guardians\u2019 secret symphonies. The complexity and richness of a Guardian\u2019s pattern is gauged by counting how many unique echoes it holds, for this reflects the depth of its being.\n\nThe grand council seeks to evaluate this richness not just for one Guardian but for the entirety of all possible Guardians\u2014every conceivable stream of the sacred length, combined from any stone hues within the universe\u2019s color bounds. They demand the sum of these unique echo counts across all such guardians\u2014an unfathomable tally, to be rendered in a realm-conscious way, by folding the total count into a finite cosmic modulo, ensuring the measure remains within the known cosmic scale. The two core inputs to this calculation are the legion size of the sequence and the maximum stone hue possible.\n\nFor keepers of the archives, the input format is as follows: on one solitary line, two numbers are recorded\u2014the integer that dictates the length of the sequence, followed by the integer that sets the upper limit of the stone hues. Both numbers dwell between the smallest positive unity and one million plus six hundred, truly challenging the wisdom of the archivists. The output is a singular integer inscribed in the codex, representing the grand sum of all unique echo counts, modulo a sacred prime number, ten to the ninth plus seven, ensuring the number\u2019s cosmic validity.\n\nConsider these ancient entries inscribed for new acolytes: a single-length Guardian with hues allowed up to three yields a total echo sum of six\u2014a simple yet profound beginning. A double-length Guardian with only two hues blesses the archive with fourteen echoes. And triad streams, with triple hues, stir the vault with one hundred seventy-four echoes. Each example serves to illuminate the path for those who dare to grasp the infinite complexity of our Sequence Guardians.\n\nThrough this meticulous lore, the cosmic keepers hope to fully comprehend the depth and breadth of the sequence zoo, capturing the pure essence of all possible Guardians in a single, sublime number.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nFor a sequence a of n integers between 1 and m, inclusive, denote f(a) as the number of distinct subsequences of a (including the empty subsequence).\n\nYou are given two positive integers n and m.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the hallowed halls of the Arcane Academy, aspiring mages face a daunting trial known as the Inversion Challenge. Picture a grand, ancient tableau, a giant magical grid sprawling before them with countless tiny runes\u2014each rune glowing either dark or bright. This vast panel is arranged with a certain number of horizontal rows woven by mystical threads and a series of vertical columns crafted from elder wood, their intersections shimmering with either the absence or presence of arcane light, represented by the faint flicker of two colors\u2014shadow or blaze.\n\nThe Academy's Law of Duality declares that a mage may, with a single incantation, choose either an entire horizontal strand or a vertical pillar of the tableau and invert its runes\u2019 states. Where shadows once clung, brilliant flames erupt, and where fire danced, darkness returns. This transformation, though powerful, demands precision: no partial gestures, only entire lines succumb to this flip. This magical dance can be performed as many times as one desires, allowing cunning wizards to twist the tableau\u2019s glow as they see fit. Yet, the ultimate quest remains\u2014to reshape the grid until the glowing embers are as few as possible, sparing the ancient tableau\u2019s essence while minimizing the blaze\u2019s reach.\n\nThe trial is straightforward in its terms: first, the apprentices receive the size of the tableau, told by two numbers\u2014the count of horizontal threads, which is modest but never surpasses twenty, and the count of vertical pillars, which stretch as long as ten thousand times ten, an immense expanse, teeming with arcane details. On the next lines, the current state of each thread is revealed in sequences of symbols indicating whether that rune burns with radiant fire or rests in quiet shadow. The mages must then inscribe a single number upon their scrolls\u2014the smallest number of glowing runes achievable after invoking any number of these whole-row or whole-column inversions, painting the flickering tableau into darker, subdued harmony.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a tableau comprising three ancient threads crossed by four elder pillars, with the glowing pattern written as follows:\n\nRow one: shadow, blaze, blaze, shadow  \nRow two: blaze, shadow, blaze, shadow  \nRow three: shadow, blaze, blaze, blaze  \n\nApplying their arcane manipulations, the wise can coax the tableau into a new form\u2014where only two glowing runes remain. This feat of invisibility showcases the scholar\u2019s grasp over the ancient tapestry, demonstrating how even amidst radiant chaos, mastery can bring forth profound quietude.\n\nThus, the Arcane Academy\u2019s Inversion Challenge beckons: with the power to flip threads of fire and shadow as entire lines at a time, one must unravel the glowing maze to reveal the minimal blaze possible, declaring not only understanding but true command over the magical tableau\u2019s eternal rhythm.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a table consisting of n rows and m columns. Each cell of the table contains either 0 or 1. In one move, you are allowed to pick any row or any column and invert all values, that is, replace 0 by 1 and vice versa.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of cells with value 1 you can get after applying some number of operations?\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 20, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively.\n\nThen n lines follows with the descriptions of the rows. Each line has length m and contains only digits '0' and '1'.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible number of ones you can get after applying some sequence of operations.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 4\n0110\n1010\n0111\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2",

        "question_title": "Beautiful Subarrays",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn a bustling toy factory known as the Land of Automatons, the master engineer ZS the Coder had devised a grand blueprint. He envisioned a long production line lined with intricate toy components, each uniquely stamped with a magical energy value. This line consisted of a multitude of these enchanting parts, sometimes up to a million in length, each glowing with a power scale no greater than a billion. Among these components, ZS believed that certain sequences carried a special vibrance, which he called \"beautiful strands.\" These strands captured his fascination because they held the key to creating the most wondrous toys ever imagined.\n\nNow, in the fabric of this factory's magic, a \"strand\" was not just any group of toys but a continuous connected stretch from one part of the line to another, smoothly flowing next to each other without gaps. ZS had discovered that when one combined the energies of these contiguous components according to an ancient magical operation\u2014sort of like flipping bits in a wand and seeing how their powers entwined\u2014the resulting enchantment could be measured by comparing it to a mystical threshold called K. If this combined enchantment was as bold or bolder than K, then the strand was deemed \"beautiful.\" The values of K could be any formidable number up to the order of a billion, making the beauty hard to achieve but deeply rewarding.\n\nZS\u2019s grand challenge was to count, among all possible connected segments of the production line\u2014ranging from tiny pairs to nearly the whole operation\u2014which strands were truly beautiful, meaning their combined magic achieved or surpassed that threshold K. The length of the line and the magical threshold were carefully recorded, first by listing the total number of parts in the line alongside the mysterious parameter K on a single sheet. Just below it, the energy values of each toy component were noted in order, each a whole number not exceeding the grand limit of one billion.\n\nThe goal was not just to identify some beautiful strands but to efficiently tally every single one without missing or double-counting, to provide a comprehensive inventory of where the factory\u2019s magic flared brightest. The outcome was to be distilled into a single number\u2014the count of all these enchanted segments\u2014and presented plainly for all to see.\n\nFor instance, consider when the line held three magical parts, glowing with values of 1, 2, and 3, and the threshold K was but a modest 1. It turned out that five different strands met or surpassed this vitality. When the threshold rose to 2 over the same trio, only three magical strands qualified. But at the loftier height of 3, the count dropped to just two glowing physical sequences in the entire lineup.\n\nThus, ZS the Coder sought the insight and craft to reveal these beautiful subarrays, unraveling the hidden glow patterns littered along his endless toy production line. Only by mastering this count could the factory realize the dream of automaton toys sparkling with the rarest magic.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nOne day, ZS the Coder wrote down an array of integers a with elements a1, a2, ..., an.\n\nA subarray of the array a is a sequence al, al + 1, ..., ar for some integers (l, r) such that 1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n.

        "question_title": "Lena and Queries",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the neon-lit world of Retro Toy Cataloging, Lena is a meticulous compiler tasked with organizing magical toy pairs inside an enchanted ledger. Each toy pair is a unique duo, one named \u201cx\u201d representing the toy\u2019s power level, and the other called \u201cy\u201d denoting its charm score. The ledger begins completely empty, and over the course of many cataloging sessions, Lena receives instructions known as queries\u2014each directing her either to add a new toy pair, remove one previously added, or to find the mightiest toy combination given a mystical power factor.\n\nLena\u2019s rules for managing the enchanted ledger are strict yet straightforward. She must work through a grand total of N sessions, where N can be as large as three hundred thousand. During any session, she faces one of three challenges: First, to enshrine a new toy pair, carrying both its power and charm values, into the ledger\u2019s collection; second, to erase a toy pair that was added during a previous session\u2014a session always earlier than the current one and one whose toy pair still exists, ensuring no phantom toys are lost twice; and third, when invoking a magical power factor Q that could be a hefty positive or a deep negative number, she must swiftly identify which toy pair in the ledger, when multiplied by this power factor and boosted by charm, yields the most impressive enchanted score. Should the ledger hold no pairs at that moment, the response must admit its emptiness. The toy powers and charms can vary greatly, spanning from deeply negative to highly positive values.\n\nLena\u2019s overarching mission is clear: to carry out all queries in sequence, ensuring the ledger reflects the current collection precisely. When asked to uncover the maximum enchanted score empowered by any given Q, she must compute the highest possible sum one can obtain by multiplying a toy\u2019s power by Q and then adding the toy\u2019s charm, exploring all toy pairs currently in the ledger. If no toys remain, she must gracefully indicate the absence by declaring the ledger as an \u201cEMPTY SET.\u201d\n\nTo illustrate, imagine Lena facing seven sessions. First, she must answer the magical query with power factor one but finds an empty ledger\u2014so she says the ledger is empty. Then, she records the toy pair carrying power two and charm three. When again asked with power one, she reveals the enchanted score five since multiplying two by one and adding three equals five. She then adds another toy pair, powerful but strangely negative in power and great in charm, at negative one and one hundred respectively. Another magical query at power one reveals this toy\u2019s mightier score ninety-nine, which she eagerly declares. Next, an instruction arrives to remove the fourth session\u2019s toy pair, swiftly removing it from the ledger\u2019s pages. Finally, on the closing query invoking power one, Lena once again announces that the highest enchanted score is five.\n\nThus, through these cataloging tales, Lena\u2019s ledger faithfully reflects the dynamic world of toy powers and charms, allowing each magical query to surface the mightiest combination\u2014the ultimate artifact of her Retro Toy Catalog Compiler\u2019s craft.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nLena is a programmer. She got a task to solve at work.\n\nThere is an empty set of pairs of integers and n queries to process. Each query is one of three types:\n\n1. Add a pair (a, b) to the set.\n2. Remove a pair added in the query number i. All queries are numbered with integers from 1 to n.\n3. For a given integer q find the maximal value x\u00b7q + y over all pairs (x, y) from the set.\n\nHelp Lena to process the queries.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nEach of the next n lines starts with integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 3) \u2014 the type of the query.\n\nA pair of integers a and b ( - 109 \u2264 a, b \u2264 109) follows in the query of the first type.\n\nAn integer i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) follows in the query of the second type. It is guaranteed that i is less than the number of the query, the query number i has the first type and the pair from the i-th query is not already removed.\n\nAn integer q ( - 109 \u2264 q \u2264 109) follows in the query of the third type.\n\nOutput Format\nFor the queries of the third type print on a separate line the desired maximal value of x\u00b7q + y.\n\nIf there are no pairs in the set print \"EMPTY SET\".\n\nSample Input 1\n\n7\n3 1\n1 2 3\n3 1\n1 -1 100\n3 1\n2 4\n3 1\n\nSample Output 1\n\nEMPTY SET\n5\n99\n5",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the bustling realm of SocialNet, where every citizen thrives on rising popularity scores, a fascinating challenge unfolds. Each of the kingdom\u2019s residents bears a positive prestige value\u2014a reflection of their current social standing\u2014arranged in a long parade of friends and acquaintances. The total number of these participants can range from a modest gathering to a grand assembly no larger than three thousand, ensuring the complexity of adjustments remains manageable yet significant. Each persona\u2019s initial popularity spans from humble figures to towering heights, capable of reaching into the billions.\n\nThe social laws here decree a vital order: the parade must be an ascending spectacle of popularity, strictly climbing from one individual to the next without any ties or drops. This means each person must be more admired than the one before. Yet, the citizens are free to reinvent themselves; they may increase or decrease their social value by one unit anytime, even venturing into zero or negative esteem, if it serves the greater purpose of reforming the order. However, every shift\u2014upwards or downwards\u2014is a costly move, demanding time and effort from the social strategists helping them. Minimizing the overall exertion in transforming this gathering into an ever-growing sequence of fame is the ultimate quest.\n\nThe grand task is to figure out the least exhausting path to this perfectly ordered popularity parade. The input into this challenge unfolds on the first scroll: a single number telling the parade length. During the next proclamation, the entire sequence of current popularity scores is revealed in a line. Your goal is to calculate and announce the minimum total effort\u2014measured by the count of individual unit shifts across all participants\u2014that must be invested to artfully tweak the popularity values so each individual proudly outshines the one before them.\n\nTo illuminate this, consider a tale where seven citizens stand with scores: 2, 1, 5, 11, 5, 9, 11. By painstakingly nudging some down and others up, such as transforming the second participant\u2019s score to 3 and others accordingly, the final lineup becomes a magnificent climb: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11. The total exertion to reach this harmonious crescendo adds up to nine small shifts. In another story with five citizens ranked 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, the challenge intensifies. Raising the entire sequence into a perfect rise of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 demands twelve incremental and decremental moves combined, showing the cost of reversing fortunes.\n\nThrough this social simulation, the essence is clear: starting with any array of popularity values among a crowd not exceeding three thousand, each ranging enormously high, one must intelligently strategize who to elevate or humble, by how much and in which direction, to sculpt an impeccably ascending parade while expending minimal social effort. Your reward is the number representing this minimal effort, a true testament to the artistry of social equilibrium.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nSonya was unable to think of a story for this problem, so here comes the formal description.\n\nYou are given the array containing n positive integers. At one turn you can pick any element and increase or decrease it by 1. The goal is the make the array strictly increasing by making the minimum possible number of operations. You are allowed to change elements in any way, they can become negative or equal to 0.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3000)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the array.\n\nNext line contains n integer ai (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 109).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the minimum number of operation required to make the array strictly increasing.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n7\n2 1 5 11 5 9 11\n\nSample Output 1\n\n9\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5\n5 4 3 2 1\n\nSample Output 2\n\n12\n\nNote\nIn the first sample, the array is going to look as follows:\n\n2 3 5 6 7 9 11\n\n|2 - 2| + |1 - 3| + |5 - 5| + |11 - 6| + |5 - 7| + |9 - 9| + |11 - 11| = 9\n\nAnd for the second sample:\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n|5 - 1| + |4 - 2| + |3 - 3| + |2 - 4| + |1 - 5| = 12",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the ancient grimoire of a master witch, there lies a tale of a mystical tapestry woven in three horizontal bands, stretching across a land divided into a certain count of vertical realms\u2014each realm no greater than one hundred thousand in number. This tapestry is no ordinary cloth; each segment glows with a rune bearing a mysterious integer, sometimes shining bright with the warmth of positive energy, other times shadowed by a cold negative mark.\n\nThe elder magical law decrees that a seeker must traverse this tapestry starting from the very first rune at the top-leftmost edge of the upper band. From each rune, it is only possible to move to an adjacent rune sharing a direct border\u2014meaning one may only step left, right, or between the horizontal bands if they share a side, never leaping diagonally or omitting any neighboring connection. The journey must not retrace any step; no rune may be visited twice lest the magic becomes unstable. The goal is to travel through this tapestry, weaving a path that ends precisely at the final rune on the bottom band, farthest to the right, gathering as much arcane energy as possible by summing the glowing values of each rune visited along the way.\n\nOur task, inscribed in this enchanted text, seeks a path from top-left to bottom-right: one that visits each step exactly once, respecting the adjacent-movement law, and, most importantly, collects the maximum possible sum of the stored energies. The grandeur of this quest scales with the length of the tapestry, from a single vertical realm to tens of thousands, and the values on each rune may swing wildly\u2014imbued with the power of entire forests or cursed with the chill of deep shadows.\n\nThe ancient incantations specify how the seeker must receive their guidance: first, utter the number of vertical realms across the tapestry on a solitary line. Then, on the very next three lines, reveal the runes\u2019 energies row by row, each line painting the tapestry\u2019s horizontal band from left to right. The seeker must respond by expressing a single, magnificent number\u2014the greatest sum achievable by any valid path from the very first rune of the top band to the last rune of the bottom band, honoring the ancient law of no repeated stepping.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a modest tapestry woven of three vertical realms. All the upper runes glow with benign light, the middle band whispers a mix of kindness and subtle malice, while the bottom band shines clearly again. A path can be traced so pure that the total sum of energies is seven\u2014a wondrous outcome. In another example with five vertical realms, even though darkness lurks in some runes, the path chosen harvests an astounding total charm of 110, triumphing through clever steps. These tales remind us that every movement in the magical tapestry holds weight, and the greatest power is unlocked not by wandering aimlessly but by the wise seeker\u2019s surefooted path.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a rectangular table 3 x n. Each cell contains an integer. You can move from one cell to another if they share a side.\n\nFind such path from the upper left cell to the bottom right cell of the table that doesn't visit any of the cells twice, and the sum of numbers written in the cells of this path is maximum possible.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105) \u00a0\u2014 the number of columns in the table.\n\nNext three lines contain n integers each \u00a0\u2014 the description of the table. The j-th number in the i-th line corresponds to the cell aij ( - 109 \u2264 aij \u2264 109) of the table.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput the maximum sum of numbers on a path from the upper left cell to the bottom right cell of the table, that doesn't visit any of the cells twice.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n1 1 1\n1 -1 1\n1 1 1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n7\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5\n10 10 10 -1 -1\n-1 10 10 10 10\n-1 10 10 10 10\n\nSample Output 2\n\n110\n\nNote\nThe path for the first example:\n\nThe path for the second example:",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the shadowed grand halls of a vast locked mansion, Limak, a keen puzzle enthusiast, stumbled upon a cryptic artifact: a peculiar grid etched into a double-layered marble table. This mysterious grid stretched horizontally, with two parallel rows of ancient numbered tiles, each column forming a tightly woven connection between the two layers. The numbers carved into these tiles were not ordinary\u2014they could be bountiful blessings, ominous curses, or perfectly neutral values, shifting the very essence of this strange formation.\n\nThe mansion\u2019s lore described a curious rule: within this double-layered arrangement, only certain rectangular sections could be deemed *nice*. A *nice* section was one where the mystical sum of all the numbers hidden within its tiles balanced to exactly nothing\u2014neither gain nor loss. Such magical rectangles had to be contiguous horizontally and could stretch either across just the upper row, just the lower, or both rows together\u2014yet they had to form perfect rectangular blocks. There was a catch: Limak couldn\u2019t gift overlapping or touching rectangles; no tile could belong to more than one chosen *nice* rectangle. The challenge was to claim as many of these peaceful rectangles as possible from the grid, without any dispute over the tiles.\n\nLimak\u2019s task was clear but daunting. First, from the mansion\u2019s records, he learned how vast the grid could be\u2014the number of columns could stretch to nearly three hundred thousand, making brute force impossible and demanding sharp deduction. Each tile\u2019s number might plunge deeply into the negative or rise to vast positive numbers, reflecting powerful arcane energies in the mansion\u2019s veins. Limak needed to determine the highest number of non-overlapping *nice* rectangular sections he could collect, where each section yielded a serene sum of zero. The outcome would reveal the most gifts he could spread among his friends, each gift symbolizing a peaceful balance amid chaos.\n\nThe records explained how the input, like the mansion\u2019s blueprint, would arrive in three parts: first, the grand width of the grid\u2014how many columns it spanned. Next, the two lines of the grid\u2019s layers, each line a sequence of the twisted integers inscribed on each tile from left to right. Limak would then uncover, after meticulous analysis, a single number\u2014the maximum quantity of these perfect rectangles he could claim without territorial conflicts.\n\nTo illustrate, one ancient example told of a six-column grid where swirling numbers wove a complex pattern: many rectangles yielded balance, but only three could be chosen without overlap\u2014a triumph that brought hope. Another tale from the depths revealed a four-column grid filled with zeros and balanced opposites, allowing Limak to gather six small, solitary rectangles, each a perfect gift in itself. Yet, the rarest legend spoke of a three-column grid where the entire layout balanced as one but resisted any subdivision, allowing only a solitary grand rectangle to be claimed.\n\nThus, Limak faced the locked mansion\u2019s enigma: to seek out and select the maximal number of these harmonious rectangles, ensuring none trespassed upon the same ground, thereby turning the mansion\u2019s cold cryptic symmetry into a bounty of pure, balanced wonders.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nLimak has a grid that consists of 2 rows and n columns. The j-th cell in the i-th row contains an integer ti, j which can be positive, negative or zero.\n\nA non-empty rectangle of cells is called nice if and only if the sum of numbers in its cells is equal to 0.\n\nLimak wants to choose some nice rectangles and give them to his friends, as gifts. No two chosen rectangles should share a cell. What is the maximum possible number of nice rectangles Limak can choose?\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of columns in the grid.\n\nThe next two lines contain numbers in the grid. The i-th of those two lines contains n integers ti, 1, ti, 2, ..., ti, n ( - 109 \u2264 ti, j \u2264 109).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint one integer, denoting the maximum possible number of cell-disjoint nice rectangles.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n6\n70 70 70 70 70 -15\n90 -60 -30 30 -30 15\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3\n\nSample Input 2\n\n4\n0 -1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n\nSample Output 2\n\n6\n\nSample Input 3\n\n3\n1000000000 999999999 -1000000000\n999999999 -1000000000 -999999998\n\nSample Output 3\n\n1\n\nNote\nIn the first sample, there are four nice rectangles:\n\nLimak can't choose all of them because they are not disjoint. He should take three nice rectangles: those denoted as blue frames on the drawings.\n\nIn the second sample, it's optimal to choose six nice rectangles, each consisting of one cell with a number 0.\n\nIn the third sample, the only nice rectangle is the whole grid\u00a0\u2014 the sum of all numbers is 0. Clearly, Limak can choose at most one nice rectangle, so the answer is 1.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the heart of a bustling city stood a renowned Tea House, famed not only for its delicate blends but also for the intricate system it used to manage its endless rows of ornate tea canisters. These canisters were arranged in a long line, each proudly labeled with a positive number that never exceeded the total number of canisters present that day. The manager of the Tea House was tasked with a peculiar challenge involving these canisters and their mysterious numeric labels.\n\nEach morning, the manager received a ledger filled with requests. Each request described a starting position along the line of canisters and a special step size\u2014like a secret pattern for moving between the canisters. The manager would begin at the specified start, then hop forward. But the hop wasn\u2019t just by the step size provided; instead, the manager would leap forward by adding together the canister\u2019s own label at the current spot and the step size from the request. This strange ritual repeated: from the new position, the hop was again the sum of the label found there plus the step size. The manager continued these leaps until stepping beyond the end of the entire line of canisters.\n\nThe goal was clear yet demanding: for each request, determine how many such hops the manager must take before stepping beyond the last canister. The longer the chain of hops, the deeper the exploration in the canisters' mysterious pattern. Efficiency was prized \u2014 the manager had to process thousands upon thousands of requests, each with different starting points and step sizes, all as quickly as possible to keep the Tea House running smoothly.\n\nTo aide memory, the ledger was organized methodically: the very first line recorded the count of the canisters, a number that could climb up to one hundred thousand. The next line held the labels for each canister neatly in a sequence, each label a positive number no greater than the total count of canisters themselves. Then came the counts of requests, again as many as a hundred thousand. Each subsequent line detailed one request: a starting position somewhere in the line of canisters and a step size that matched the constraints of the canister numbering.\n\nFor example, suppose there were only three canisters, all labeled with the number one. The manager faced three requests. The first began at the very first canister, stepping with size one. The hops proceeded as first hop: position jumps to third canister; second hop: from there jumps beyond the last canister, finishing in two hops. The next requests started at the second and third positions, each stepping by one, but only needed one hop each before stepping out of range.\n\nWith such a finely balanced dance between labels, starting points, and step sizes, the Tea House manager mastered the art of counting the hops with speed and precision. The sequence of hop counts for every request was recorded, each number telling a tale of the journey through canisters, and each final tally was shared as the answer to maintain harmony and efficiency within the esteemed Tea House.\n\n### Coding Test format:\na is an array of n positive integers, all of which are not greater than n.\n\nYou have to process q queries to this array. Each query is represented by two numbers p and k. Several operations are performed in each query; each operation changes p to p + ap + k. There operations are applied until p becomes greater than n. The answer to the query is the number of performed operations.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100000).\n\nThe second line contains n integers \u2014 elements of a (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 n for each i from 1 to n).\n\nThe third line containts one integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 100000).\n\nThen q lines follow. Each line contains the values of p and k for corresponding query (1 \u2264 p, k \u2264 n).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint q integers, ith integer must be equal to the answer to ith query.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n1 1 1\n3\n1 1\n2 1\n3 1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n1\n1\n\nNote\nConsider first example:\n\nIn first query after first operation p = 3, after second operation p = 5.\n\nIn next two queries p is greater than n after the first operation.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the vibrant kingdom of Marmotia, the grand Festival Parade is fast approaching, a spectacular event requiring the creation of dazzling Scrolls of Knowledge. The marmots of this land have been entrusted with the sacred task of crafting a certain number of these scrolls over the span of many festival days. Each day allows only a single scroll to be carefully penned, and likewise, only one scroll can be inscribed with enchanting letters to bring it to life. However, the mystical laws of Marmotia decree that a scroll cannot be inscribed unless it has already been penned\u2014or at least penned on the very day of its inscription.\n\nEach day bears its own particular cost in golden coins\u2014some days demand a heavier toll for the delicate act of penning, while others charge more dearly for the magical inscription. The marmots know that their coffers are limited, so they strive to minimize the number of precious coins spent on both crafting and inscribing the scrolls.\n\nOver the course of many moons\u2014no more than a couple of thousand days\u2014the marmots must prepare exactly as many scrolls as a chosen number less than or equal to the days available. They may choose which days to pen and which days to inscribe, but the order must remain strict: a scroll penned on an earlier day cannot be inscribed on an earlier day than it was penned, and each scroll must be uniquely matched to its day of inscription following this logic. Crafting and inscribing can happen on the same day for any given scroll if the marmots so wish.\n\nThe challenge before the marmots is clear: from the ledger of daily penning costs and inscription costs, determine a schedule that results in the exact number of scrolls prepared and inscribed, adhering to the festival\u2019s sacred timing rules, while spending as few golden coins as possible. The marmots must provide on the first line of their royal report two numbers\u2014the total days of the festival and the exact number of scrolls required. On the second line, they present a list of all the daily penning costs, followed on the third line by their respective inscription costs. Their final task is to reveal on a solitary line the least number of coins needed to fulfill the grand commission.\n\nFor example, imagine a festival spanning eight days where four scrolls must be created. The marmots know the daily cost of penning each scroll and the daily cost of inscribing it: on day one, the penning cost is low, but inscription is also cheap on the first day. On some days, the cost spikes, while others offer a more affordable price for either crafting or inscription. One optimal plan might be to pen and inscribe the first scroll on day one, the second scroll penned on day two but inscribed later on day four, the third penned on day three but inscribed on day five, and the last penned on day six and inscribed on the final day, day eight. This careful dance yields the minimal sum of golden coins spent, tallying exactly thirty-two\u2014a triumph of efficient planning and adherence to the festival\u2019s laws.\n\nThus, the marmots prepare their schedules, balancing craft and inscription costs across the festival\u2019s days, all while fulfilling the sacred promise of delivering their scrolls in time for the grand Festival Parade.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nThe marmots need to prepare k problems for HC2 over n days. Each problem, once prepared, also has to be printed.\n\nThe preparation of a problem on day i (at most one per day) costs ai CHF, and the printing of a problem on day i (also at most one per day) costs bi CHF. Of course, a problem cannot be printed before it has been prepared (but doing both on the same day is fine).\n\nWhat is the minimum cost of preparation and printing?\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 2200).

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the bustling corridors of Harmony High, the school was abuzz with anticipation for the grand event known as HC2 3387\u2014a legendary contest that took place so far in the future that even the calendar seemed dizzy trying to count the days. The planning committee, a quirky band of students affectionately called the marmots, had set their sights on designing a mind-boggling set of challenges, imagining a sprawling contest with hundreds of thousands of puzzles to test every student\u2019s wits. Yet, before they could dream this big, they needed a meticulous plan to make sure the preparations could be managed efficiently.\n\nIn this school\u2019s unique system, each student had two distinct skills measured by sets of numbers, recorded in the student council\u2019s ledger. There were, at minimum, one marmot and at most five hundred thousand marmots involved in the setup\u2014each represented by a pair of scores on two separate lists. However, the marmots decided to focus on selecting a meaningful group of these students to assign to pivotal roles. The catch? The group\u2019s size had to be carefully chosen\u2014it couldn\u2019t be smaller than a certain number nor larger than the total marmots at hand. This range was strict because picking too few would leave the contest unsupported; too many, and chaos would reign.\n\nThe marmots\u2019 goal was to find the optimal size for their chosen group, called \"k,\" somewhere between one and the total number of candidates \"n.\" Once they settled on this number, they would select exactly that many students, weighting their contributions by pairing their scores from the two skill lists. The challenge lay in maximizing the sum of the products of these paired scores\u2014like matching team members so that their combined talents shining together would be as strong as possible. Every selection and pairing had to count, because in this school\u2019s logic, the sum represented the collective power that would drive HC2 3387\u2019s success. Their task was not just to meet the size constraints but to push this sum as high as it could go, ensuring the contest\u2019s preparations were powered by the best possible collection of talents.\n\nThe input to this meticulous planning began with a single line, where the total number of marmots and the size of the chosen group were recorded\u2014two numbers whispering the story of \u201chow many\u201d and \u201chow many to pick.\u201d On the following line, the first list of skill scores for all candidates stood neatly arranged, while the very next line mirrored this with the second list of scores. These lines, echoing the relentless buzz of student activity, held the keys to unlocking their optimal team. As the marmots crunched through these numbers, their output was simply one line: the largest achievable sum of paired talents, a number revealing the success of their strategy.\n\nTake, for example, a day when eight marmots were available, and they sought to choose four to steer the grand project. Their first skill scores might be something like three, eight, seven, nine, nine, four, six, and eight, while their second scores were two, five, nine, four, three, eight, nine, and one. By cleverly matching these values and selecting exactly four students, they discovered that the maximum collective power they could muster was thirty-two\u2014a shining beacon of their combined effort and thoughtful planning.\n\nSo, as the marmots closed their diary on this chapter of preparation, the numbers on the pages weren\u2019t just cold statistics\u2014they were the lifeblood of a perfect team ready to make HC2 3387 their school\u2019s proudest moment yet, all while balancing the delicate dance of choosing just enough and yet no more. In this way, deep within the heart of Harmony High, the marmots learnt that sometimes, the best plans aren\u2019t just about what\u2019s possible\u2014but what\u2019s optimal.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nThe plans for HC2 are rather far-fetched: we are just over 500 000 days away from HC2 3387, for example, and accordingly we are planning to have a couple hundred thousand problems in that edition (we hope that programming contests will become wildly more popular). The marmots need to get to work, and they could use a good plan...\n\nInput Format\nSame as the medium version, but the limits have changed: 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 500 000.\n\nOutput Format\nSame as the medium version.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n8 4\n3 8 7 9 9 4 6 8\n2 5 9 4 3 8 9 1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n32",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the secretive depths of the Genetic Algorithm Laboratory, researchers are fascinated by the mysterious behavior of sequences of integers\u2014think of them as the genomes of a strange new life form. Each genome is a lineup of positive traits, known as gene markers, arranged in order. The vital property that these scientists focus on is the shared ancestry of the whole sequence, which they define as the greatest common divisor, or in their terms, the \"Genetic Commonality Unit\" (GCU). A sequence is declared unique and vibrant\u2014what they call \"coprimality\"\u2014if this GCU is just one, meaning these traits have no shared prime origin, symbolizing genetic diversity and robustness.\n\nWithin this laboratory, an experiment is underway: given a particular genome consisting of a chain of N gene markers, each marker carrying a trait value that might be as subtle as one or as complex as ten thousand, the team must discover all possible subsequences where this genetic diversity is preserved. By subsequence, they mean selecting traits from the genome in the order they appear, but not necessarily all in a row. Two subsequences are considered distinctly different if they differ even by one trait\u2019s position\u2014even if the trait\u2019s value is the same, reflecting the importance of lineage and context in genetic makeup.\n\nThe great challenge is to quantify exactly how many of these genetically diverse subsequences exist within a given genome. Because genomes can be massive\u2014stretching up to a hundred thousand gene markers\u2014and because the number of such subsequences can exceed the limits of computing power, the researchers must report their count wrapped under a special modulus of 1,000,000,007, a mystical number ensuring their tallies remain within manageable realms. The goal is not only to find these diverse subsequences but to calculate their count as extensively and accurately as possible, respecting the sequences' structure and their lineage-based distinctions.\n\nTo begin the experiment, a scientist feeds the genome size, a single number representing how many markers are lined up, and then provides the ordered list of gene markers. For example, if they announce the number three and then present the markers as one, two, and three, the team inspects all subsequences and counts those with a GCU of one. In this case, five such subsequences exist: the lone \"one\"; the pairs \"one and two,\" \"one and three,\" and \"two and three\"; and the entire trio \"one, two, three.\" Notably, any repeat trait values taken in different positions generate distinct subsequences.\n\nIn another scenario, where every gene marker in a four-marker genome is identical, all subsequences except the empty one count as genetically diverse because the trait one embodies perfect diversity by itself. Here, with four ones, the count reaches fifteen\u2014every possible subsequence except the void.\n\nLastly, consider the complex genome of seven markers laden with intricate values such as one, three, five, fifteen, three, one hundred five, and thirty-five. The genealogy is richer here, and after an exhaustive scan by the researchers, they conclude there are precisely one hundred distinctive subsequences exhibiting the vital genetic diversity where the shared prime essence evaporates into unity.\n\nThus, through the laboratory\u2019s tools and principles, geneticists unravel the count of all distinct subsequences that dance freely with individual traits, free from common genetic chains, revealing the richness and subtlety of these numeric genomes under the grand modulus of their experimental order.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nLet's call a non-empty sequence of positive integers a1, a2... ak coprime if the greatest common divisor of all elements of this sequence is equal to 1.\n\nGiven an array a consisting of n positive integers, find the number of its coprime subsequences. Since the answer may be very large, print it modulo 109 + 7.\n\nNote that two subsequences are considered different if chosen indices are different. For example, in the array [1, 1] there are 3 different subsequences: [1], [1] and [1, 1].\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains one integer number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100000).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2... an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 100000).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the number of coprime subsequences of a modulo 109 + 7.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n1 2 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n5\n\nSample Input 2\n\n4\n1 1 1 1\n\nSample Output 2\n\n15\n\nSample Input 3\n\n7\n1 3 5 15 3 105 35\n\nSample Output 3\n\n100\n\nNote\nIn the first example coprime subsequences are:\n\n1. 1\n2. 1, 2\n3. 1, 3\n4. 1, 2, 3\n5. 2, 3\n\nIn the second example all subsequences are coprime.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the age of ancient empires, a grand army was preparing for a decisive campaign. The army\u2019s battalions were arranged in a vast, linear formation stretching across the plains\u2014imagine a mighty line of thousands and thousands of soldiers, each standing shoulder to shoulder, their strengths marked by whispered tales: some warriors robust and others less so. This formation was not random; it was constructed by repeating a core regiment\u2019s pattern\u2014an ancestral melody of soldier strengths\u2014from the heart of the kingdom. This base regiment contained a precise number of warriors, each with their intrinsic valor measured by secret numbers. The generals took this regiment and replicated it many times to build the full line, stretching across the battlefield as far as the eye could see, numbering up to around millions of warriors.\n\nHowever, the battlefield was fluid, and the generals often had to issue special commands during the maneuvers. There were two kinds of imperial orders: one could decree that every soldier standing between two marked spots along the line must suddenly adopt a new, unified strength\u2014imagine a regiment donning freshly forged armor, magically setting their prowess to the same level instantly. The other command was to send spies along a stretch of the line to report the finest smallest strength in any segment, an intelligence report critical to the battle\u2019s progress. The catch was, these commands had to be executed quickly, sometimes affecting vast stretches of the army\u2019s formation\u2014tens of thousands of warriors long\u2014and the commanders could not afford delays lest the enemy seize the advantage.\n\nYour mission, as the master of logistics, is to keep track of this colossal formation and respond to these imperial commands with utmost efficiency. First, the army\u2019s formation comes from repeating the base regiment\u2019s pattern a certain number of times. The base pattern itself is fixed, known only by the initial secret strengths of its soldiers. Upon receiving a command that orders all soldiers within a certain span to change their prowess to a single value, you must dutifully alter that segment in your records. Upon receiving a command from the scouts\u2014asking for the minimum strength value over a stretch\u2014you must return the lowest strength among all soldiers in that stretch. The challenge lies in balancing quick updates with swift retrievals, as the length of the line can be vast and the number of commands many, reaching tens or hundreds of thousands.\n\nTo illustrate, imagine a regiment of three warriors with strengths of 1, 2, and 3 respectively, forming the entire line only once over. Three commands come: first, a scout asks for the smallest valor between the first and third warriors, and the answer is the smallest among 1, 2, and 3, which is 1. Next, a commander orders the first two warriors to wear new armor, setting their strength to 4. Lastly, the scout again asks for the smallest strength between the first and third warriors\u2014the answer now reflects the updated line, yielding 3, since the first two are at 4 but the last remains 3.\n\nIn a larger example, imagine the same regiment repeated twice\u2014thus six warriors in line: 1, 2, 3, then 1, 2, 3 again. Five commands weave through the ranks: a scout spies on the fourth warrior alone, reporting strength 1; a commander sets the fourth warrior\u2019s strength to 5; another scout checks the fourth warrior, now noting 5; then a monumental order resets the entire line\u2019s strength to 1, unifying all six warriors; finally, the scout peeks at the sixth warrior, discovering its strength is now 1.\n\nThus, with your command over the grand battlefield's records, you ensure all updates and reports keep the army\u2019s strength organized, letting the generals strike precisely and with knowledge upon the endless plains. The fate of the battle rests on how deftly you manage this massive, ever-changing human array.\n\n---\n\n**Input Format in the Language of the Empire**:  \nAt the outset, the master receives two numbers on the first line\u2014the number of warriors in the ancestral regiment, and the number of times this regiment is replicated to form the full line. On the next line, the strengths of each warrior in the single regiment are declared in order. Next, the number of commands to be executed is revealed. Following this, each command is delivered on its own line: if it is an armor replacement order, it comes as a four-part message saying \u201ctype one, start position, end position, new strength,\u201d and if it\u2019s a scout report, as a three-part message saying \u201ctype two, start position, end position.\u201d\n\n**Output Format:**  \nFor every scout report in the commands, the master replies with a single number on its own line: the smallest strength value in the requested segment.\n\n---\n\nThis tale of strategy and numbers captures the essence of managing a vast repeating army formation under strict orders\u2014crafting and maintaining seamless strength updates in the heat of battle with swift, precise intelligence gathering.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array a consisting of positive integers and q queries to this array. There are two types of queries:\n\n- 1 l r x \u2014 for each index i such that l \u2264 i \u2264 r set ai = x.\n- 2 l r \u2014 find the minimum among such ai that l \u2264 i \u2264 r.\n\nWe decided that this problem is too easy. So the array a is given in a compressed form: there is an array b consisting of n elements and a number k in the input, and before all queries a is equal to the concatenation of k arrays b (so the size of a is n\u00b7k).\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 104).\n\nThe second line contains n integers \u2014 elements of the array b (1 \u2264 bi \u2264 109).\n\nThe third line contains one integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 105).\n\nThen q lines follow, each representing a query. Each query is given either as 1 l r x \u2014 set all elements in the segment from l till r (including borders) to x (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n\u00b7k, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 109) or as 2 l r \u2014 find the minimum among all elements in the segment from l till r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n\u00b7k).\n\nOutput Format\nFor each query of type 2 print the answer to this query \u2014 the minimum on the corresponding segment.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 1\n1 2 3\n3\n2 1 3\n1 1 2 4\n2 1 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\n3\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3 2\n1 2 3\n5\n2 4 4\n1 4 4 5\n2 4 4\n1 1 6 1\n2 6 6\n\nSample Output 2\n\n1\n5\n1",

Tonight, we delve deep beneath the silence to unravel the delicate balance of connections that bind this nocturnal labyrinth together. Imagine a domain made of a vast assembly of mysterious nodes, scattered across the cityscape \u2014 as many as hundreds of thousands \u2014 each a beacon waiting to be linked to another in whispered secrecy. Yet, in this silent geometry, no path exists at the start; the network begins with each node utterly alone, solitary stars in a boundless dark.\n\nThe citizens of this dim metropolis have a peculiar custom. They exchange tangled threads of communication\u2014edges\u2014between pairs of these nodes. Each thread is bidirectional, flowing freely in both directions. But the city's order comes from a strict, almost mystical rule: the entire network must always be conceivable as if painted in just two hues \u2014 perhaps \u201cMoonlight Silver\u201d and \u201cTwilight Blue.\u201d No direct communication thread may ever connect two hubs sharing the same shade. If such a violation creeps in, shadows spiral into chaos, and the harmony is broken. Whenever a thread is introduced or severed, the current state of the entire network must be checked: can the city\u2019s map still be tinted flawlessly in these two colors without a forbidden connection appearing? This serene bicolor balance is their touchstone.\n\nNow consider the ongoing radio broadcast where every query is a whispered command \u2014 to weave one new connection between two distinct nodes, or to sever an existing bond between them if already present. Each request unfolds in sequence; first, the network begins bare, then a series of commands arrive \u2014 as many as one hundred thousand times over the dark expanse. For each such command, the listener must decide immediately: is the newly adjusted network still harmoniously bicolored? The answer must echo across the airwaves as a clear \u201cYES\u201d when the balance holds, or a resolute \u201cNO\u201d when discord grips the web. Precision and swift judgment shine here, for each thread\u2019s addition or removal may delicately tip the scale from order to ruin or restore calm.\n\nLet us bring this to life through a few transmissions. Enter three nodes into our nocturnal city and five commands to bind or break their connections. First, the thread between the second and third nodes springs alive\u2014\u201cYES,\u201d the city assures, as the colors can still gently shift around the new bond. Next, between the first and third twinkles, another connection glows\u2014still \u201cYES,\u201d no conflict arises. Then the thread from the first to the second hums in presence\u2014this time, a \u201cNO\u201d resounds, conflict breaching the bicolor peace. Yet, if that last thread is severed, the city breathes again, \u201cYES.\u201d If rejoined, \u201cNO,\u201d ever reminding us of the fragile balance.\n\nThus, our midnight chronicles mandate that for every single thread-twist or thread-break across tens of thousands of moments, the city\u2019s security in its two-tone harmony must be declared: \u201cYES\u201d if peace remains, \u201cNO\u201d if shadows creep in. Tune your senses and algorithms alike to this whispered mandate, for the fate of the Radio City\u2019s spectral order depends on your swift, flawless judgment. The archive awaits your reckoning\u2014what will your verdict be at each pulse of connection?\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices. Initially there are no edges in the graph. Also you are given q queries, each query either adds one undirected edge to the graph or removes it. After each query you have to check if the resulting graph is bipartite (that is, you can paint all vertices of the graph into two colors so that there is no edge connecting two vertices of the same color).\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n, q \u2264 100000).\n\nThen q lines follow. ith line contains two numbers xi and yi (1 \u2264 xi < yi \u2264 n). These numbers describe ith query: if there is an edge between vertices xi and yi, then remove it, otherwise add it.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint q lines. ith line must contain YES if the graph is bipartite after ith query, and NO otherwise.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 5\n2 3\n1 3\n1 2\n1 2\n1 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\n**Carnival Game Engineering Log**\n\nA year ago at the bustling public park, Leha stumbled upon a curious collection of numbered tiles scattered across an old wooden bench. Each tile bore a number, ranging from a humble single digit to an impressively large figure not dwarfing even a billion. The total count of these tiles could never overwhelm a single-handed skilled juggler, for there were at most three hundred of them in Leha\u2019s discovery. Inspired, Leha devised a carnival game\u2014one where players might rearrange the tiles in any order they wished, but with an intriguing catch: no two neighboring tiles when multiplied together should create a magical perfect square relic. Such relics, as lore went, had powers that could unravel the carnival\u2019s harmony if ever they appeared in a neighboring pair.\n\nThe rules of the game relied heavily on this mysterious property. Imagine the carnival stage, where each tile, when placed side by side, would whisper numbers to each other. If the product of any two adjacent tiles transformed into a perfect square \u2014 like the legendary squares of 1, 4, 9, 16 and so on \u2014 the permutation was considered flawed, and disqualified from the winning circle. Leha called all arrangements that upheld this harmony \u201cright permutations.\u201d The challenge for the carnival engineers was daunting: with hundreds of tiles, how many such harmonious sequences could one create? The catch was that the answer might be a colossal number, so the engineers recorded the final count in a special enchanted modulo, specifically the number just exceeding one billion by seven, ensuring their machines could handle the grand totals without error.\n\nThe task was clear yet intricate. First, one would receive a single number representing exactly how many tiles sat to be arranged\u2014no more than three hundred, an upper bound guaranteeing the game\u2019s feasibility. On the next line, a precise list of these tiles in their found order would be revealed, each number potentially as grand as a digit with ten zeros tacked on. From there, the engineer\u2019s goal was to compute how many ways the tiles could be reordered so that no neighboring pair summoned a perfect square product. The final answer, reflecting all the valid harmonious permutations, would be presented as a single integer on one line, elegantly wrapped by the enchanted modulo to keep calculations clean and concise.\n\nTake, for example, a modest group of three tiles: marked with the numbers one, two, and four. Arranging them in their found order delights the harmony; their neighbors multiple into products two and eight, neither conjuring a forbidden perfect square. But swap the second and third tiles, and the spell breaks\u2014the product four emerges from two times two, a perilous perfect square, voiding that arrangement\u2019s safety. In truth, among every scrambled arrangement of these three tiles, only two preserve the magical balance. Let\u2019s consider another, more crowded stage, with seven pieces: a mix of fives, twos, fours, and ones, doubling some again to test the creative limits. Here, the carnival\u2019s ancient formulas revealed a much richer tapestry\u2014144 right arrangements to delight the crowd and keep the carnival in joyous equilibrium.\n\nThus, by carefully examining the magical properties of each neighboring pair\u2019s product across all permutations, the carnival engineers could unlock the secret count of right permutations. These numbers, though hidden in complexity, represented the true measure of harmony in Leha\u2019s enchanted bench. And so, with each set of tiles entered and processed, the carnival prepared to greet players with challenges both mysterious and fair, inviting all to engage in the splendid puzzle of numbers dancing without summoning the dreaded perfect squares.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nA year ago on the bench in public park Leha found an array of n numbers. Leha believes that permutation p is right if for all 1 \u2264 i < n condition, that api\u00b7api + 1 is not perfect square, holds.

        "question_title": "Shortest Path Problem?",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the mystic world of Monster Evolution, a grand kingdom is connected through enchanted pathways carved by ancient beasts. These pathways do not behave like ordinary roads; rather, their lengths are shaped by the mystical energies they carry, measured in peculiar forces known as \u201cxor-weights.\u201d The kingdom consists of a sprawling network of enchanted stones\u2014each stone representing a resting place\u2014linked by these magical pathways. Some of these pathways loop back on themselves or even run parallel to others, and every stone is reachable from any other, ensuring the land is united under a single web of connections.\n\nThe laws of the kingdom decree that the distance one travels along these mystical pathways is found not by simple addition but through combining the secret powers of each path with a special fusion known as \"exclusive-or.\" Imagine a traveler journeying from one resting stone to another\u2014the strength of their journey\u2019s length is determined by repeatedly mixing these magical energies (the xor operation) along every step. Passing the same path multiple times weaves its power repeatedly, intensifying or nullifying the total force accordingly. The enchantment thus demands that the shortest route cannot be measured by mere footsteps but by this incorporeal xor-value weaving through the stones.\n\nYour challenge is to advise the kingdom\u2019s master explorer as they prepare to journey from the first resting stone\u2014known as Stone One\u2014to the final sanctuary, Stone N. You are given the layout of the kingdom: the number of resting stones and the many magical paths connecting them. For each magical path, you know which two stones it links and the strength of the magic held in that path\u2019s essence. Your task is to guide the explorer along a path where the blending of all magical energies encountered results in the smallest possible xor-force\u2014the absolute minimum length in terms of this arcane measurement.\n\nThe master explorer\u2019s instructions are precise: first, you receive the count of resting stones and the number of magical paths. Then, on separate lines for each path, you are told which two stones are linked and the magical strength it carries. Remember, some paths may link a stone to itself or multiple paths may connect the same pair of stones, and the kingdom\u2019s design always guarantees a route from Stone One to Stone N. Your response must be a single number\u2014revealing the minimal combined xor-strength of any path leading from Stone One directly to Stone N, guiding the master explorer safely and efficiently across the magical kingdom.\n\nConsider this: in a small kingdom of three stones connected by three pathways\u2014first connecting Stone One and Stone Two with strength three, second linking Stone One and Stone Three with two, and third joining Stone Three and Stone Two with none\u2014the smallest magical force along the way from Stone One to Stone Three is two. In another realm with two stones connected by two routes, one looping back to itself with strength three and the other connecting Stone One to Stone Two with strength three, it turns out the minimal magical force to reach Stone Two is nothing at all\u2014zero\u2014since the looping path neutralizes the magical power through repetition. These examples guide your understanding as you advise the explorer to unravel the kingdom\u2019s network and find the path with the least magical xor-force.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an undirected graph with weighted edges. The length of some path between two vertices is the bitwise xor of weights of all edges belonging to this path (if some edge is traversed more than once, then it is included in bitwise xor the same number of times). You have to find the minimum length of path between vertex 1 and vertex n.\n\nNote that graph can contain multiple edges and loops. It is guaranteed that the graph is connected.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100000, n - 1 \u2264 m \u2264 100000) \u2014 the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.\n\nThen m lines follow, each line containing three integer numbers x, y and w (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 w \u2264 108). These numbers denote an edge that connects vertices x and y and has weight w.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint one number \u2014 the minimum length of path between vertices 1 and n.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 3\n1 2 3\n1 3 2\n3 2 0\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n\nSample Input 2\n\n2 2\n1 1 3\n1 2 3\n\nSample Output 2\n\n0",

Each year, the kingdom\u2019s merchant council compiles a scroll predicting the value of a magical gem that changes price daily over the course of a long cycle\u2014spanning anywhere from a couple to as many as three hundred thousand days. Gossip and rumors about these price shifts spread through the market squares, but only the council holds the true foresight. They announce, on the first day of the census, the number of days the gem\u2019s price will be recorded, followed by a parchment detailing each day\u2019s foretold gem value.\n\nThe kingdom\u2019s law allows citizens to transact at most one gem per day\u2014either purchasing a single gem, selling exactly one gem they currently own, or abstaining completely from trading on that day. The rulebook clearly states that no one may sell a gem they do not possess; possessions begin at zero, and by the close of the final day in the cycle, every trader must have returned to owning zero gems, neither debt nor surplus allowed. This system is designed so that wealth is only gained legitimately through shrewd timing of purchases and sales. The council\u2019s lore admonishes that each gem is indivisible and must be traded in whole units, never fractions.\n\nThe challenge for a wise merchant in Ledgeria, then, is to devise a strategy to maximize their silver\u2014an endeavor treasured by the throne and celebrated by citizens alike. Using the sacred scroll of prices, the merchant may decide their action for each day: to buy one gem at its predicted value, to sell one previously acquired gem at the day\u2019s price, or to refrain from any transaction. The quest is not merely to abide by the rules but to conclude the entire span of days with as much silver as possible\u2014profit from buying low and selling high, while ensuring that at the close, the merchant holds no gems to avoid forbidden debts or unaccounted wealth.\n\nThe recording of the census begins with a single number etched sharply onto the first line of a ledger page: the total count of days in the cycle. On the very next line, a long sequence of integers is inscribed, each representing the gem\u2019s price on that particular day in turn. A prospective merchant reads these entries, then must declare the grand total of silver coins one could attain by cleverly buying and selling gems according to the kingdom\u2019s strictures. This final tally is shared with the council and is known as the maximum possible profit by day\u2019s end.\n\nFor example, within nine days of the gem\u2019s changing worth, the scroll reads prices like this: 10, 5, 4, 7, 9, 12, 6, 2, 10. The savvy trader would seize opportunity by purchasing on the days when the gem\u2019s value is low\u2014buying first at five, then again at four, and carefully choosing to sell when the gem glimmers highest, say at nine and later at twelve. Another strategic buy might be at two, followed by a sale when the price ascends to ten. This sequence of transactions transforms initial silver into a bounty totaling twenty coins. Likewise, in a longer cycle of twenty days with varied prices, a master merchant can amass a treasure of forty-one coins. The Royal Census Ledger thus celebrates not merely the record of gem prices but the brilliance of those who navigate its ebb and flow best.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou can perfectly predict the price of a certain stock for the next N days. You would like to profit on this knowledge, but only want to transact one share of stock per day. That is, each day you will either buy one share, sell one share, or do nothing. Initially you own zero shares, and you cannot sell shares when you don't own any. At the end of the N days you would like to again own zero shares, but want to have as much money as possible.\n\nInput Format\nInput begins with an integer N (2 \u2264 N \u2264 3\u00b7105), the number of days.\n\nFollowing this is a line with exactly N integers p1, p2, ..., pN (1 \u2264 pi \u2264 106). The price of one share of stock on the i-th day is given by pi.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the maximum amount of money you can end up with at the end of N days.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n9\n10 5 4 7 9 12 6 2 10\n\nSample Output 1\n\n20\n\nSample Input 2\n\n20\n3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9 7 9 3 2 3 8 4\n\nSample Output 2\n\n41\n\nNote\nIn the first example, buy a share at 5, buy another at 4, sell one at 9 and another at 12. Then buy at 2 and sell at 10. The total profit is - 5 - 4 + 9 + 12 - 2 + 10 = 20.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the sprawling Floating Market of Eldoria, merchants thrived by trading peculiar tokens\u2014each token etched with a number denoting its origin tribe. The tokens were arranged in long, magical beadstrings, where neighboring tokens told stories and held value in their order and combination. The Master Ledger Keeper, all-knowing and wise, was tasked with an intricate challenge: to divide a given beadsring of particular length into several smaller non-overlapping clusters of tokens, called bundles, such that the total \"conflict\" among tokens within all bundles was minimized. This conflict was akin to the discord that arose when too many tokens from the same tribe crowded within a single bundle, causing quarrels and lowering the value of that bundle.\n\nThe rules of this arcane market were strict and well-known across the waterways. First, the original beadsring must be split into a precise number of bundles\u2014a number not exceeding twenty, but never fewer than two, and obviously less than or equal to the total number of tokens. Each bundle had to be meaningful, holding at least one token, with the union of all bundles recreating the entire beadstring in order. The \"conflict score\" of each bundle was revealed by counting how many pairs of distinct tokens within it hailed from the same tribe, irrespective of the order in which they appeared. The goal was to arrange the splitting so that when one summed the conflict scores from every bundle, this total was as low as possible, ensuring harmonious trade and the highest ledger rating.\n\nThe Ledger Keeper\u2019s instructions were precise. The input scroll contained two numbers: the full length of the beadstring and the exact number of bundles it must be divided into. On the very next scroll line, the Keeper enumerated the tribes of the tokens in sequence. By understanding these inputs, the Keeper was to determine the minimal sum of conflicts achievable by any valid partition of the beadstring into bundles. The output, carved clearly onto the final ledger page, was a single integer\u2014the smallest total conflict score attainable across all the bundles after splitting.\n\nTo illustrate, in the first scenario, the beadstring had seven tokens and was to be split into three bundles. The tokens from tribal origins one and three appeared with curious repetition. The optimal split was to isolate the first token in its own bundle, group the second and third tokens together, and gather the remaining four into the last bundle. Out of these, only the last bundle incurred a slight conflict, with just one pair of duplicate tokens, setting the recorded minimal conflict to one.\n\nIn another episode, a longer beadstring of ten tokens needed two bundles. The tokens alternated regularly between two tribes. Splitting the string into two equal halves was wiser, because each half then bore a conflict score of four, making eight the minimal total conflict for the whole.  \n\nLastly, for a more complex thirteen-token beadstring divided into three bundles, a careful partitioning resulted in bundles holding conflicts of four, four, and one, respectively. This clear arrangement illuminated the balance necessary to minimize quarrels: the grand total conflict was nine. By following the ancient ledger's structure\u2014reading the number of tokens and bundles first, then the sequence of tribal tokens\u2014and applying the wisdom of minimizing repeated pairs in each bundle, the Master Keeper ensured the Floating Market\u2019s commerce remained smooth, rich, and filled with harmony.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array of n integers a1... an.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the depths of the Space-Time Puzzle Labyrinth, explorers encounter a mysterious matrix of shimmering portals anchored at unique coordinates within an infinite cosmic plane. Each portal has a precise integer pair of cosmic coordinates marking its location, like ancient runes etched across the void. The labyrinth\u2019s ancient logic dictates that each portal can either summon a vertical temporal stream that ascends and descends through it, or a horizontal spatial ripple that extends endlessly in either sidewise direction, or occasionally, none at all, remaining silent in stillness.\n\nWithin this labyrinth, the formation of lines follows peculiar rules of cosmic symmetry. If multiple portals summon vertical streams at the same spatial coordinate, these streams merge into a solitary pillar of light. Similarly, horizontal ripples sharing an identical vertical coordinate unify into a single wide wave. The labyrinth calls these unified beams *distinct spectral lines*. The essence of the challenge is to understand into how many unique constellations of spectral lines the portals' choices can assemble, given that the labyrinth treats coincident lines as indistinguishable and desires the most comprehensive count of all possible spectral patterns.\n\nTo navigate this puzzle, the space-time explorers first learn of the constraints etched into the labyrinth\u2019s fabric: from a collection of no fewer than one and no more than one hundred thousand distinct portals scattered across boundless space\u2014with each portal\u2019s coordinates stretching far into both positive and negative cosmic directions\u2014they must consider all ways of selectively invoking vertical streams, horizontal ripples, or none at each portal\u2019s location. By doing so, the explorers reveal every possible woven tapestry of spectral lines, counting each distinct pattern only once regardless of how many portals help create the same beams. Their final task is to distill this grand total into a number that merges the infinite vastness of possibilities back into a finite cosmic signature, taken modulo one billion and seven\u2014a sacred prime number governing the labyrinth\u2019s essence.\n\nThe explorers receive their instructions etched clearly: first, they learn the total number of portals appearing before them, written on a single cryptic line. Then, the next lines each reveal the twin celestials\u2014the x and y coordinates\u2014that mark each portal's place in the plane. Understanding this formation, the explorers compute and output one single line: the count of distinct spectral line compositions possible, humbled and simplified by the labyrinth\u2019s prime modulus.\n\nIn one recorded trial, four portals at coordinates (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2) birthed an astonishing sixteen unique patterns of spectral lines. These lines stemmed from two vertical streams at positions 1 and 2, and two horizontal ripples at positions 1 and 2, each line either appearing or not, creating a complex dance of energy beams. In another trial with just two portals anchored at (-1,-1) and (0,1), the possibility reduced gracefully to nine unique configurations, reflecting the independent influences of two separate cosmic points.\n\nThus, in the endless expanse of the Space-Time Puzzle Labyrinth, the explorer\u2019s quest is clear: enumerate every way to awaken these portals\u2019 lines\u2014vertical and horizontal\u2014in unison or in silence, counting all distinct celestial diagrams in the light of the cosmos, constrained by the primal modulus that keeps the infinity in check.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given n distinct points on a plane with integral coordinates. For each point you can either draw a vertical line through it, draw a horizontal line through it, or do nothing.\n\nYou consider several coinciding straight lines as a single one. How many distinct pictures you can get? Print the answer modulo 109 + 7.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of points.\n\nn lines follow. The (i + 1)-th of these lines contains two integers xi, yi ( - 109 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 109)\u00a0\u2014 coordinates of the i-th point.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all points are distinct.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the number of possible distinct pictures modulo 109 + 7.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4\n1 1\n1 2\n2 1\n2 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\n16\n\nSample Input 2\n\n2\n-1 -1\n0 1\n\nSample Output 2\n\n9\n\nNote\nIn the first example there are two vertical and two horizontal lines passing through the points. You can get pictures with any subset of these lines. For example, you can get the picture containing all four lines in two ways (each segment represents a line containing it).\n\nThe first way: The second way:\n\nIn the second example you can work with two points independently. The number of pictures is 32 = 9.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn a small, bustling high school, there was an annual tradition\u2014the \"Grid Quest,\" an event where students unravel mysteries woven into the fabric of a giant checkerboard map laid out in the school courtyard. This checkerboard was no ordinary playground game; it was divided into several rows and columns, with each square either glowing warmly or remaining dark, representing spots where school spirit was either sparked or dormant that day. The rows of this board varied from as few as one to just over two hundred, while the columns stretched widely but always in a length that could be divided neatly into groups of four.\n\nOn the morning of the event, the participants were handed a curious book. The first page revealed two numbers: these numbers told them how many horizontal layers and vertical strips the checkerboard would have. It was understood that the count of vertical strips would always split perfectly into bundles of four, reinforcing the school\u2019s obsession with neatness and balance. Each subsequent page contained cryptic symbols, each symbol representing a quartet of adjacent squares in a particular row. These symbols used the school's secret language\u2014a blend of digits and letters\u2014to encode which squares in that group glistened with energy and which did not. For example, a symbol like \"B\" whispered secrets that the four corresponding squares were alive with a pattern like flickers of light and shadow in the sequence of on-off, on-on, on-off, on-on again. No spaces or gaps interrupted this script, each line a seamless stream of encoded hints.\n\nThe heart of the challenge was to uncover how many clusters of lively squares existed on the board, where a cluster meant any group of vibrant squares touching along their edges, like friends holding hands in a circle. Diagonal brushes of fingers did not count; only those directly beside\u2014left, right, above, or below\u2014could be part of the same cluster. The goal was not merely to identify a single cluster, but rather to locate every distinct community of these active squares, no matter how large or small, across the entire playground map. Keen minds had to contemplate how each symbol unlocked four squares, then piece together the adjacency of these lively squares to reveal how many unique friendships sparkled across the grid.\n\nWhen a student submitted their answer, they presented only a single number: the count of vibrant clusters found on that day\u2019s grid adventure. To illustrate, a small-scale trial featured three horizontal layers with four columns each. After decoding, the patches of lit squares combined into three separate groups\u2014hence, the answer was three. In another test, a grid stretched across two rows and eight columns, and careful reading showed two distinct clusters of brightness. Lastly, a simpler scenario presented only one row with four dull squares, producing no lively connections, and thus the answer stood at zero.\n\nThrough these puzzles of light and shadow, coded messages and pattern recognition, the students learned not just to read symbols but to see how connections bind individuals into communities\u2014a metaphor for their own lives within the vibrant corridors of the school. The Grid Quest became more than a game; it grew into a celebration of unity and the beauty of finding oneself among the glowing groups that together form the heart of the school\u2019s spirit.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a matrix of size n x m. Each element of the matrix is either 1 or 0. You have to determine the number of connected components consisting of 1's. Two cells belong to the same component if they have a common border, and both elements in these cells are 1's.\n\nNote that the memory limit is unusual!\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 212, 4 \u2264 m \u2264 214) \u2014 the number of rows and columns, respectively. It is guaranteed that m is divisible by 4.\n\nThen the representation of matrix follows. Each of n next lines contains \\frac{m}{4} one-digit hexadecimal numbers (that is, these numbers can be represented either as digits from 0 to 9 or as uppercase Latin letters from A to F). Binary representation of each of these numbers denotes next 4 elements of the matrix in the corresponding row. For example, if the number B is given, then the corresponding elements are 1011, and if the number is 5, then the corresponding elements are 0101.\n\nElements are not separated by whitespaces.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the number of connected components consisting of 1's.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 4\n1\nA\n8\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3\n\nSample Input 2\n\n2 8\n5F\nE3\n\nSample Output 2\n\n2\n\nSample Input 3\n\n1 4\n0\n\nSample Output 3\n\n0\n\nNote\nIn the first example the matrix is:\n\nIt is clear that it has three components.\n\nThe second example:\n\nIt is clear that the number of components is 2.\n\nThere are no 1's in the third example, so the answer is 0.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\n**Heist Planning Manual: The Ciphered Map Strategy**\n\nIn the shadowy world of elite heists, a specialized crew gathers intelligence from a mysterious city whose streets and landmarks form a vast interconnected network. This city's layout, though complex, is perfectly symmetrical\u2014each point of interest within the city is directly connected to every other, forming an intricate tapestry of routes where every path holds hidden values dictated by secret codes etched onto each location.\n\nEach landmark in this city is branded with a unique cryptic number, a code that guards its true value. When two landmarks are connected by a path, the cost or \u201crisk level\u201d of traveling that path is determined by an arcane operation between their codes\u2014a secret handshake known only to the elite. This operation, akin to a digital cipher, combines the two codes to reveal the hidden weight of the path. The crew knows well that their safest and most efficient escape involves finding a route that touches every landmark without retracing their steps, minimizing the overall risk of detection. But the streets are treacherous, and time is limited\u2014the map includes up to two hundred thousand such landmarks, and each cryptic number is less than two hundred seventy-three million, making plans challenging yet crucial.\n\nThe mission is clear: the team must construct a plan that links all landmarks, ensuring each point is connected by the safest possible paths. Their goal is to assemble what\u2019s called the \u201cminimum spanning web,\u201d a select set of paths connecting every landmark at the lowest total risk, according to the secret cipher operation between codes. To do this, they will be handed the number of landmarks first, and on the very next line, each landmark\u2019s unique number will be revealed in sequence. Using this, the team must calculate the minimal sum of risks encountered across the entire network that still successfully connects every point.\n\nTo illustrate, suppose the team\u2019s informant provides five landmarks marked with the codes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Through employing their cipher operation to every possible route and selecting the safest connections, the crew discovers their risk is minimized to an aggregate value of eight. In another case, with four landmarks coded 1, 2, 3, and 4, the strategy similarly yields a total risk of eight. These examples guide the crew in understanding how to parse their intelligence and assemble the optimal plan.\n\nIn summary, the crew\u2019s task is to, first, accept the total number of landmarks, then receive the cryptic codes for each. Their output\u2014the final plan\u2014must be a single figure revealing the minimized sum of risks for their spanning network, ensuring a flawlessly orchestrated heist through the city\u2019s ciphered paths. Success means the crew moves unseen, shadows connecting shadows, with every route carefully chosen to weave the perfect escape.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a complete undirected graph with n vertices.

The tuple contains the weight of the edge and the index of the connected vertex.\n3. **Prim's Algorithm:** The code implements Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree.\n   - `visited`: A list to keep track of visited vertices.\n   - `key`: A list to store the minimum edge weight to reach each vertex from the spanning tree.\n   - `parent`: A list to store the parent vertex of each vertex in the spanning tree.\n   - `priority_queue`: A min-heap to store vertices and their corresponding edge weights.\n4. **Algorithm Steps:**\n   - Initialize `key[0]` to 0 (starting vertex) and add it to the priority queue.\n   - While the priority queue is not empty:\n     - Extract the vertex with the minimum key from the priority queue.\n     - If the vertex is already visited, skip it.\n     - Mark the vertex as visited.\n     - Iterate through its neighbors:\n       - If the neighbor is not visited and the edge weight is less than the current minimum key to reach the neighbor, update the neighbor's parent, key, and add it to the priority queue.\n5. **Calculate Total Weight:** After the algorithm completes, iterate through `key` and sum up the minimum edge weights to reach each vertex, which represents the total weight of the minimum spanning tree.\n6. **Output:** The code prints the calculated total weight of the minimum spanning tree.\n\n\n\n",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the heart of the Ecosystem Simulation Console, a vibrant world unfolds where creatures embody numbers, and their behaviors follow elegant yet intricate rules. The realm stretches across a sequence of territories, each governed by its unique cycle of rhythms and resets. Here, the essence of existence for any roaming entity is measured by the energy it harnesses as it traverses this layered world\u2014energy drawn from the echoes of its interactions with each territory\u2019s pulse.\n\nImagine there are a certain number of these territories arranged in a line, each with a distinctive beat that resets itself upon reaching a particular threshold. The most intriguing phenomenon in this ecosystem is how a single creature, represented by an unseen magnitude, experiences this sequence of territories. When this entity steps into the last territory, it feels the remainder of its own essence divided by that territory\u2019s cycle. Before that, upon entering any preceding territory, it senses two gifts: the remainder when its self-reflection is contrasted against that territory\u2019s own cycle, plus the wisdom gleaned from the remainder left when moving to the next territory in line. The rules dictate that the total essence collected is the sum of these echoes of remainders from the first territory all the way to the last, each adding a layer of vitality.\n\nYour mission, as the ecosystem\u2019s master, is to discover the perfect essence level for your creature\u2014 a nonnegative measure of its being\u2014such that when it journeys through this entire chain of cycles, the sum of all the echoed remnants of its essence is as grand as possible. Within this grand challenge, the length of the territory sequence can stretch as long as a few hundred thousand cycles, and each territory\u2019s unique rhythm can vary greatly, stretching even into the trillions! The input to the console reveals first how many territories there are, on a single opening line\u2014the length of the sequence. On the very next line, each territory\u2019s individual rhythm is presented, laid out as a list of whole numbers that beckon your strategic manipulation.\n\nTo navigate this world, you must output a single number\u2014the peak vitality your creature can achieve after its pilgrimage through all the territories, measured by the total sum of these radiant echoes. This output represents the grand maximum of all possible nonnegative magnitudes your creature could embody, carefully calibrated to harvest the richest sum of remainders gathered from the sequence\u2019s cumulative cycles.\n\nConsider the first small world, with just two territories pulsing at rhythms of ten and five. If the creature chooses to be of essence nineteen, the sum of its echoes through the journey totals thirteen, a staggering figure highlighting the harmony of path and rhythm. In another realm, five territories beat at five, four, three, two, and one, where the pinnacle of summed echoes stands at six, attainable when the creature embodies an essence of three or two. Lastly, a mixed land with four territories sharing rhythms five, ten, five, and ten finds its highest sum of vitality at sixteen, illustrating the intricate dance of remainders and sequences.\n\nThus, the ecosystem\u2019s rulebook remains clear: from the number of territories to their individual rhythms, from choosing the creature\u2019s essence to uncovering the path that maximizes the sum of all these pulsing echoes\u2014your task is to unearth the creature\u2019s perfect essence to reign supreme in this ever-dynamic, modular orchestration.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the shadowy corridors of the sprawling metropolis known as the Graph Syndicate, every building\u2014let\u2019s call them Nodes\u2014stood linked by secret passageways called Edges. These passageways weren\u2019t merely corridors; each had a weight\u2014a danger level to be reckoned with\u2014and the entire network was fiercely interconnected, meaning no Node stood isolated from another. Within this world, the supreme power was held by an elite team that could forge the perfect minimal network, a structure called the Minimum Spanning Tree. This sacred MST connected every Node while minimizing the total danger one must face traveling through the passageways. But MSTs were not unique; many potential configurations could qualify, and choosing one caused resentment among the unused passageways, breeding envy and conflict.\n\nNow, the espionage scenario deepened: given the vast city with its multitude of Nodes and diverse passageways, a shadow operative was tasked with assessing whether certain sets of these suspicious passageways could be simultaneously part of some secret MST. Each passageway was identified by its endpoints and the danger level that stalked it. The operative learned that the city\u2019s blueprint guaranteed connectivity\u2014no Node stood truly unreachable. Each inquiry posed by the syndicate\u2019s clients was a set of passageway IDs, and the operative had to reveal whether there existed any legitimate minimal danger network that included all of those requested darkest paths without contradiction. The city was enormous, with potentially hundreds of thousands of Nodes and passageways, and the sum of the client\u2019s demands was similarly vast, forcing the operative to work swiftly and decisively.\n\nThe operative\u2019s mission was clear: upon receiving the city\u2019s comprehensive map\u2014starting with a first line detailing how many Nodes the city harbored and how many passageways linked them\u2014the next several lines described each passageway\u2019s hidden endpoints and its danger score. Following that came the client\u2019s series of requests, each listing the number of passageways they insisted must be part of the MST and the passageways\u2019 unique identifiers. For every client request, the operative had to respond without hesitation, whispering \u201cYES\u201d if the requested passageways could coexist peacefully within some minimal danger network, or \u201cNO\u201d if such harmony was impossible. The operative\u2019s goal was more than mere detection; it was about assuring the clients that their chosen paths could be embraced fully with minimal risk\u2014a perfect balance, a silent blueprint for domination.\n\nTo illustrate the gravity of decisions, consider a segment of this metropolis with five Nodes and seven passageways, each with their own danger ratings. The operative received four inquiries: one demanded that two specific passageways be included, another pushed for three, the third requested two, and the last pleaded an additional two. Deductions showed that some clusters of passageways could coexist within a minimal danger framework\u2014answering \u201cYES\u201d\u2014while others led to impossible cycles or conflicts among the paths, forcing a \u201cNO\u201d response. These judgments revealed complex interactions, like the case where including three passageways formed a closed loop, violating the essential tree-like structure of the MST, while others fit snugly, maintaining the network\u2019s delicate balance.\n\nAt the close of this mission, the operative had navigated the vast web, confirming which sets of requested passageways could be folded into a master plan with the lowest cumulative danger, and which sets would ignite dangerous cycles and must be rejected. This balance between secrecy, efficiency, and integrity mapped the path to power within the Graph Syndicate, as the operative\u2019s sharp answers\u2014\u201cYES\u201d or \u201cNO\u201d\u2014echoed through the halls of whispered conspiracies, guiding those seeking to control the city\u2019s deadly connections without stirring the wrath of envious passageways unseen.\n\nIn the world of espionage and calculated alliances, every request carried the weight of survival. With inputs vastly stretching from two Nodes and a handful of passageways up to half a million, the operative\u2019s judgments shaped the unseen architecture of control. Each query, parsed line-by-line, like coded messages on a secure channel, demanded the utmost precision and strategic insight\u2014deciding whether the requested dark paths could be woven into the safest, most efficient network of all.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nFor a connected undirected weighted graph G, MST (minimum spanning tree) is a subgraph of G that contains all of G's vertices, is a tree, and sum of its edges is minimum possible.\n\nYou are given a graph G. If you run a MST algorithm on graph it would give you only one MST and it causes other edges to become jealous. You are given some queries, each query contains a set of edges of graph G, and you should determine whether there is a MST containing all these edges or not.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (2 \u2264 n, m \u2264 5\u00b7105, n - 1 \u2264 m)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices and edges in the graph and the number of queries.\n\nThe i-th of the next m lines contains three integers ui, vi, wi (ui \u2260 vi, 1 \u2264 wi \u2264 5\u00b7105)\u00a0\u2014 the endpoints and weight of the i-th edge. There can be more than one edges between two vertices. It's guaranteed that the given graph is connected.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 5\u00b7105)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries.\n\nq lines follow, the i-th of them contains the i-th query. It starts with an integer ki (1 \u2264 ki \u2264 n - 1)\u00a0\u2014 the size of edges subset and continues with ki distinct space-separated integers from 1 to m\u00a0\u2014 the indices of the edges. It is guaranteed that the sum of ki for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 q does not exceed 5\u00b7105.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each query you should print \"YES\" (without quotes) if there's a MST containing these edges and \"NO\" (of course without quotes again) otherwise.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5 7\n1 2 2\n1 3 2\n2 3 1\n2 4 1\n3 4 1\n3 5 2\n4 5 2\n4\n2 3 4\n3 3 4 5\n2 1 7\n2 1 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\nNote\nThis is the graph of sample:\n\nWeight of minimum spanning tree on this graph is 6.\n\nMST with edges (1, 3, 4, 6), contains all of edges from the first query, so answer on the first query is \"YES\".\n\nEdges from the second query form a cycle of length 3, so there is no spanning tree including these three edges. Thus, answer is \"NO\".",

Otherwise, it returns `False` (equivalent to \"NO\").\n\n3. **Input and Output:**\n   - The code reads the graph's edges and the number of queries from standard input.\n   - For each query, it reads the indices of the edges in the query and calls `check_mst` to determine if they can be included in the MST.\n   - The result (\"YES\" or \"NO\") is printed to standard output for each query.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\n",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the ancient vault of the Puzzlekeeper, deep beneath the folds of time, there lies an arcane challenge whispered among the scholars of numbers. The challenge speaks of sacred quantities\u2014two mystical figures known only by their ranks in eternity, let us call them the First and the Second. It is said that the First is a great power to be unraveled, and the Second dictates the precise number of enchanted tokens through which this power must be expressed. These tokens form a secret arrangement called the \u201cSecond-split of the First\u201d\u2014a grand tapestry of numbers whose collective force conjures the original greatness of the First.\n\nThe holy decree of this challenge dictates the following: each Secret Count (the Second) must summon exactly that many tokens, no more and no less, and each token must be an integer born of the earth\u2014whole and complete. When the tokens are combined in multiplicative harmony, the product of their powers must recover exactly the original First number, with no excess or shortfall. Should any token differ in value at any position in two separate arrays of tokens, those arrays are considered unique in their nature. It is not enough to merely weave one such tapestry\u2014 the secret lies in quantifying how many distinct arrangements can faithfully recreate the First, each respecting the solemn number of tokens dictated by the Second.\n\nJourneying into this realm involves facing multiple such sacred pairs, for the Puzzlekeeper demands many riddles at once. The first scroll reveals the number of trials, a count of pairs to be unraveled. Each subsequent scroll provides these pairs of mystical numbers, one pair per line, describing a new puzzle of fractional might and division of unity. The task is clear yet profound: for each pair, the seeker must enumerate the entire spectrum of these distinct, token arrangements that embody the exact factorization of the First into the exact count of tokens, the Second. However, because the answers can swell to impossible sizes, the count must be restrained by a divine modulus, the ancient limit of one billion and seven, a mystical number protecting the vault\u2019s balance.\n\nTo present the call to the Puzzlekeeper, one must inscribe the original number of trials on the first line of the offering script. Then, on each new line, lay bare the two sacred numbers, the First and the Second, separated by space, for the Puzzlekeeper\u2019s eyes only. The response returned by the vault will be a sequence of numbers, one per line, each representing the count of possible Second-splits of the First under the divine modulus. The seeker\u2019s wisdom is proven by how fully they can enumerate these quantities for every challenge laid before them.\n\nConsider then the ancient examples etched with clarity in the Puzzlekeeper\u2019s record: when the First is six and the Second is three, the vast assembly of possible triads that multiply back to six counts to thirty-six after considering the vault\u2019s sacred balance. When the challenge speaks of the number four split into two tokens, six distinct pairs emerge from the shadows, including those symmetrical and those inverted\u2014pairs such as four paired with one, two with two, and their reversed twins. These centuries-old solutions serve to guide the new seeker through the labyrinth of factorization, illustrating both the power and breadth of the Second-split and the challenge\u2019s intricate beauty.\n\nThus, armed with wisdom and clarity, the seeker stands ready to enter the vault of the Puzzlekeeper, to accept the challenge, and to enumerate all possible token arrays that faithfully honor the ancient binding of numbers and count, generating answers as vast as the realm of numbers itself, yet tempered by the sacred laws of the infinite modulus.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given two positive integer numbers x and y. An array F is called an y-factorization of x iff the following conditions are met:\n\n- There are y elements in F, and all of them are integer numbers;\n- \\prod_{i=1}^{y} F_i = x.\n\nYou have to count the number of pairwise distinct arrays that are y-factorizations of x. Two arrays A and B are considered different iff there exists at least one index i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 y) such that Ai \u2260 Bi. Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo 109 + 7.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains one integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 105) \u2014 the number of testcases to solve.\n\nThen q lines follow, each containing two integers xi and yi (1 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 106). Each of these lines represents a testcase.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint q integers. i-th integer has to be equal to the number of yi-factorizations of xi modulo 109 + 7.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n2\n6 3\n4 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\n36\n6\n\nNote\nIn the second testcase of the example there are six y-factorizations:\n\n- { - 4, - 1};\n- { - 2, - 2};\n- { - 1, - 4};\n- {1, 4};\n- {2, 2};\n- {4, 1}.",

        "question_title": "Letters Removing",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nOn a remote island where every survivor\u2019s word carried the weight of life or death, there lived Petya, keeper of the ancient scroll woven from threads of small and grand letters, mixed not just with symbols of speech but also the stark numerals of time itself. This scroll, a living strand as long as the span of his island (just shy of the vast expanse found in the great 200,000 maps stored in the council archive), held the secrets of their fate.\n\nThe island's survival council tasked Petya with a delicate ritual: in a series of decrees\u2014each one a blend of a starting point and ending mark along the scroll\u2019s length and the chosen glyph to banish\u2014he must cleanse parts of this precious scroll. Each sacred rite required him to look between two marked positions, excluding all beings of a single tribe signified by the glyph within those boundaries. After each cleansing, the endless strand either shrank or stayed as vast as before, never growing anew. The laws of the island decree that before any cleansing, the ending mark must never stretch beyond the island's current knowledge of scroll length, ensuring no forbidden reach.\n\nPetya\u2019s challenge was to enact all of these cleanse rites\u2014up to 200,000 in number\u2014each carefully timed and marked, to reveal the scroll\u2019s true form once all the prescribed glyphs were cleansed from their given stretches. The grand goal was not merely to perform these banishments but to see what living words remained, as quickly and thoroughly as possible, by the last incantation. If the ritual should strip the scroll bare, the council would see the silent wind of emptiness.\n\nIn the tale that follows, the first chapter begins with a scroll of four characters \"abac\". The first rite banishes every \u2018a\u2019 from positions one to three, leaving a smaller scroll \"bc\". Then, cleansing removes the \u2018c\u2019 from the second position of the new strand, leaving the lone character \u2018b\u2019. Another story tells of three characters, \"A0z\". Here, a single rite erases the \u20180\u2019 from the full length, and another tries to remove \u2018z\u2019 but finds none to erase, ending with \u201cAz\u201d. In a longer thread of ten characters, complex rites remove \u2018g\u2019s, \u2018F\u2019s, \u20184\u2019s, and \u2018a\u2019s within carefully marked regions, unveiling the surviving \u201ctFrg4\u201d.\n\nFinally, a more intricate saga shows a thread of nine characters \"aAAaBBccD\" from which the council strips away every \u2018a\u2019, \u2018c\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, \u2018D\u2019, and \u2018A\u2019 from designated factions and lands, leaving only the steadfast \"AB\" at the end.\n\nThus, the council watched as Petya\u2019s scroll revealed its final true form after all sacred removals, a testament to the island\u2019s mysterious laws and the rhythm of survival in the council\u2019s decree. Those who bear such a scroll would know its length, receive its current form, and then, line by line, be given the decree of banishments\u2014the start, the end, the tribe to remove\u2014to see what words would endure the test of ritual and time.\n\nIf, after the final rite, nothing remains alive on the scroll, the council would read the silence of an empty line, signaling either great loss or the purest beginning.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nPetya has a string of length n consisting of small and large English letters and digits.\n\nHe performs m operations. Each operation is described with two integers l and r and a character c: Petya removes from the string all characters c on positions between l and r, inclusive. It's obvious that the length of the string remains the same or decreases after each operation.\n\nFind how the string will look like after Petya performs all m operations.\n\nInput Format\nThe first string contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 2\u00b7105) \u2014 the length of the string and the number of operations.\n\nThe second line contains the string of length n, consisting of small and large English letters and digits. Positions in the string are enumerated from 1.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integers l and r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r), followed by a character c, which is a small or large English letter or a digit. This line describes one operation. It is guaranteed that r doesn't exceed the length of the string s before current operation.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the string Petya will obtain after performing all m operations. If the strings becomes empty after all operations, print an empty line.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4 2\nabac\n1 3 a\n2 2 c\n\nSample Output 1\n\nb\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3 2\nA0z\n1 3 0\n1 1 z\n\nSample Output 2\n\nAz\n\nSample Input 3\n\n10 4\nagtFrgF4aF\n2 5 g\n4 9 F\n1 5 4\n1 7 a\n\nSample Output 3\n\ntFrg4\n\nSample Input 4\n\n9 5\naAAaBBccD\n1 4 a\n5 6 c\n2 3 B\n4 4 D\n2 3 A\n\nSample Output 4\n\nAB\n\nNote\nIn the first example during the first operation both letters 'a' are removed, so the string becomes \"bc\". During the second operation the letter 'c' (on the second position) is removed, and the string becomes \"b\".\n\nIn the second example during the first operation Petya removes '0' from the second position. After that the string becomes \"Az\". During the second operations the string doesn't change.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the grand courtroom of the Kingdom of Numeria, a peculiar case was brought to the attention of the wise Judge Sigma. The kingdom\u2019s councilors had gathered an ancient ledger containing a scroll of **n** numbered declarations, each inscribed with a powerful integer\u2014these were called the \"array of values.\" With the law books in hand, the judge was tasked with unraveling a complex dispute involving relationships between these declarations through a mysterious decree known as the function *d*, which dictated the \u201cdistance in influence\u201d between any two declarations.\n\nThe law of the land dictated that when comparing two declarations\u2014say, the one inscribed at position **i** and the other at position **j**, with the rule that the first is never later than the second\u2014their difference in influence depended on the magnitude of their difference. If the absolute gap between their inscriptions was one or less, the law decreed there was no conflict, and thus, the distance in influence would be nil. However, if this gap was greater than a solitary step, the influence was measured precisely as the difference of the later inscription minus the earlier one. This subtle rule was the heart of the dispute, and it applied to all possible pairs from the ledger where position **i** did not come after position **j**.\n\nJudge Sigma\u2019s task was formidable: by invoking this rule for every pair, both where a declaration stood alongside itself and paired with those after it, the judge sought the total sum of all such influences. It was a matter of great import to calculate this sum as accurately and fully as possible, reflecting the overall harmony or disharmony hidden in the ledger\u2019s inscriptions. The considerations were strict: the ledger could have up to two hundred thousand inscriptions, with each number potentially as large as a billion, making the task vast but necessary for the kingdom\u2019s order.\n\nTo illustrate the task in court, consider the first example where the ledger bore five inscriptions: 1, 2, 3, 1, 3. The judge carefully examined every pair, noting that some pairs produced no influence due to closeness, while others contributed values like 2 or -2 based on the decreed law, eventually summing the entire court\u2019s observations to arrive at a balanced verdict of the total influence being four. In another case where the inscriptions were 6, 6, 5, 5, the closeness of values quelled all disputes, resulting in no net influence at all. A final example with 6, 6, 4, 4 revealed a more divisive tableau, where the total influence resolved to negative eight, showing a deeper conflict in the ledger.\n\nThus, the procedure was clear: the first declaration read aloud the number of inscriptions to come; on the very next line, the inscriptions themselves were recited in sequence. From this, the total sum of every pair\u2019s influence, abiding by the kingdom\u2019s law, was to be declared as a single number, marking the resolution of the case. The kingdom awaited Judge Sigma\u2019s verdict, confident that through the intricate web of relationships among the inscriptions, the truth of their collective influence would be unraveled precisely and honorably.\n\nIn this courtroom drama, the input was the count of inscriptions followed by their values, and the output the final tally of all influences as dictated by *d*. With this, the kingdom of Numeria found justice not in the loudest voices, but in the delicate arithmetic of influence and harmony woven within their sacred ledger.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nLet's denote a function\n\nd(x,y) = \\begin{cases} y - x, & \\text{if } |x-y| > 1 \\\\ 0, & \\text{if } |x-y| \\leq 1 \\end{cases}\n\nYou are given an array a consisting of n integers.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the heart of a long-forgotten landscape lies an abandoned theme park, whispered about in legends as the Puzzle Pavilion. Here, amidst rusting rides and faded banners, an ancient blueprint survives\u2014etched not on paper, but in the shifting sands of time itself. This blueprint tells of a mysterious mechanism, a vast numeric gateway with many locks, each represented by a unique sequence of digits. These sequences are not random; they are always arranged in an order where the digits climb steadily from the smallest to the largest, like a line of performers stepping forward in perfect harmony.\n\nThe rules of this enigmatic gateway dictate that each sequence corresponds to a certain key, and every whole number from the very first up to a grand threshold known only as X must have its own key forged. The threshold, enormous yet finitely bounded, can scale to sizes that boggle the mind\u2014numbers as large as ten thousand to the seventh power, a colossal tribute to the power of digits. The sequence for each key is built by taking the original digits of the number and gently reordering them in ascending order, making the smallest digits step forward to the front of the line, casting an elegant shadow over those larger behind. For example, a number with jumbled parts like 5, 0, 3, 9, and 4 is transformed so the digits parade orderly as 3, 4, 5, 9, while repeating digits form groups like a chorus of three 3s marching before five 5s.\n\nTo unlock the ultimate secret of this gate, the caretaker of the Puzzle Pavilion must summon not merely a list of these sequences but the full sum of the keys from one through that towering value X. However, a cosmic law within the park limits the final tally\u2014this sum must wrap around itself in cycles of one billion and nine, plus seven, like an ancient numerical river that loops endlessly back into itself. Only the remainder of this grand addition, after folding it around this cosmic cycle, grants passage through the gate.\n\nWhen the caretaker receives the blueprint, it is presented simply\u2014a single number, X, inscribed on its own delicate parchment that hints at the scale of their task. In response, the caretaker must reveal the gate\u2019s secret number on a single, solemn scroll, representing the grand total detailed by the rules. The fortress of the Puzzle Pavilion thus waits to witness the sum of every ascending-digit key from the very first step to X.\n\nTo illustrate, when the threshold is twenty-one, the cascading sequences\u2014starting from the humble first digit to the twenty-first\u2014combine to give a secret sum of one hundred ninety-five, a clear sign of ordered harmony. In a mightier trial, with a threshold over three hundred forty-five thousand, the grand sum loops to three hundred ninety million five hundred forty-eight thousand four hundred thirty-four\u2014its digits a testament to the temple\u2019s enigmatic power. This saga of digits and sums is whispered by the pavilion\u2019s gears, waiting for those who follow the blueprint to unlock the forgotten truth.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nLet S(n) denote the number that represents the digits of n in sorted order.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nAs the night guard of the Grand Celestial Museum, I am entrusted with the solemn duty of chronicling every shift's events, detailing the subtle transformations that unfold within the halls after sundown. Tonight\u2019s report concerns the mystical Row of Artifacts, a stretch of precious relics arranged in a linear parade spanning a great number of pedestals\u2014no less than two hundred thousand in total, each adorned with an artifact bearing a value from one to one hundred, inscribed by the ancient artisans.\n\nThe museum\u2019s ancient rule book prescribes a fascinating procedure for artifact transformation tickets, authorized by the curators to enact limited, but potent, changes overnight. Across many such tickets\u2014potentially up to two hundred thousand\u2014a spell is cast to alter certain artifacts selectively. Each spell targets a segment of contiguous pedestals, bounded by two markers along the row, setting conditions that say: \u201cFor every pedestal standing from marker L to marker R, if the relic resting on it carries the symbol X, replace its symbol with Y.\u201d The markers abide strictly by the pedestal count, never wandering beyond the first or last artifact, and the chosen symbols remain within the sacred bounds of one to one hundred.\n\nMy task in this quiet vigil is clear: after the final spell has been woven into the museum\u2019s nightly tapestry, to inscribe the resulting sequence of artifacts\u2019 symbols in order, from the first pedestal to the last, reflecting all transformations without fail. This record must show the complete array of relics after every authorized change, demonstrating how the ancient runes danced and shifted on their pedestals through the curators\u2019 careful commands.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a simpler hall of five pedestals. Initially, the relics display the sequence of symbols: one, two, three, four, and five. The curators send three transformation tickets during the night:  \n- The first spell reaches from the third to the fifth pedestal, changing every artifact whose symbol is three to a five.  \n- The second examines every pedestal from the first to the fifth, converting every five into a one.  \n- The third revisits the entire stretch, transforming every one that stands tall into a five.  \n\nAfter these changes, the gallery\u2019s new sequence emerges as: five, two, five, four, five.\n\nThus, every night I produce this detailed report, starting with the number of pedestals under guard, followed on the next line by their symbols in order. Then, the count of nightly spells is noted, with each spell\u2019s instructions given line by line, specifying the segment and the symbols to be swapped. Finally, I unveil the new visage of the artifact row, reflecting the curators\u2019 will, ensuring the Museum remains a vault of living history, ever-shifting yet meticulously recorded.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array a consisting of n integers.

        "question_title": "Substrings in a String",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the ancient realm of the Shifting Labyrinth, there existed a great and serpentine word, a sacred string of intertwined letters twisting through the very fabric of the maze. This word was etched upon the walls, each letter a rune carved in humble lowercase, and the length of this mystical inscription could stretch to a vast measure\u2014not longer than one hundred thousand runes, no more. This living text, which we shall call the Great String, was the foundation of the labyrinth\u2019s arcane power.\n\nThroughout the labyrinth's endless corridors, travelers and scribes alike were tasked with two sacred decrees to manipulate or decipher the Great String. The first decree permitted one to step into the labyrinth and alter a single rune at a peculiar position, changing it to any lowercase rune they desired. This position was always within the realm of the string\u2019s length, no stranger rune should ever be summoned. The second decree was a challenge posed to those who sought deeper knowledge: given a segment of the Great String\u2014chosen by marking the path from one point to another for the labyrinth\u2019s elders\u2014a smaller pattern of runes was sought. This pattern, itself a string of lower runes, could be any length but combined across all such inquiries, their total size whispered never beyond one hundred thousand runes combined. The smaller pattern was to be found and counted, unraveling how many times it emerged within the chosen stretch of the Great String, even if these appearances overlapped like shadows woven in the dark.\n\nThe task befell the scribes: with the Great String revealed on the first page of their codex, followed by the number of mysterious queries to follow, each query arrived as an incantation either to transform a rune at a particular position or to enumerate the occurrences of a secret pattern within a specified corridor of the labyrinth\u2019s script. The labyrinth\u2019s rules numbered the runes from one at the start, moving orderly to the end, so every mark and span was traced with clarity. The travelers sought not just to find these patterns but to do so swiftly and fully, honoring the labyrinth\u2019s law to respond to every second type query with the exact count of these elusive rune sequences.\n\nTo illustrate with a saga of words: imagine the Great String etched as \u201cababababa,\u201d and there are three challenges to address. The first challenge is to count how often the pattern \u201caba\u201d can be found between the runes at the start and the seventh position of the string. The answer, three times, multiplies even as the appearances intertwine. Then comes a command to change the rune in the fifth position, the center of the word, from its original to a new rune\u2014say from \u201ca\u201d to \u201cc.\u201d After this alteration, the same pattern \u201caba\u201d is counted again between those same runes, now diminished to a single appearance. This is the living story of the labyrinth, where every change shifts fate\u2019s patterns.\n\nIn another telling from the labyrinth\u2019s annals, the string \u201cabcdcbc\u201d faced five such incantations: First, the pattern \u201cbc\u201d was sought from beginning to end, revealing two hidden places. Then a rune at position four swapped from \u201cd\u201d to \u201cb,\u201d strengthening the shadows. The pattern \u201cbc\u201d was again counted from rune four to rune seven, now discovered twice as power shifted. A further change turned the second rune into \u201ca.\u201d Lastly, a search for \u201caa\u201d from the opening runes to the fourth showed that this new pattern nested just once within the maze\u2019s twisting script.\n\nThus, every query of the second kind demanded its own solemn answer, each tallied upon a new line, echoing through the crypts of the Shifting Labyrinth. The scribes lived by the rule: to heed every transformation, and in every query, to reveal the count of the secret pattern with clarity and precision. So the chronicles continued, within a labyrinth of letters where every twist could change the fate of strings and every search might discover a pattern anew.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nGiven a string s, process q queries, each having one of the following forms:\n\n- 1 i c \u2014 Change the i-th character in the string to c.\n- 2 l r y \u2014 Consider the substring of s starting at position l and ending at position r.

        "question_title": "SUM and REPLACE",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the sprawling kingdom of Numeria, there exists a famed network of magical postcards, each carrying mystical numbers inscribed upon them. The kingdom\u2019s archivists believe these numbers hold secret properties, linked to the number of magical paths\u2014or \u201cdivisor trails\u201d\u2014each postcard can traverse in the grand system of corridors beneath the city. The richness of these trails defines the power and connectivity of each card.\n\nA curious phenomenon governs these postcards: each number upon a card corresponds to the count of its own divisor trails\u2014these invisible routes always include the origin trail starting from one, and the trail that marks the card itself. For instance, a card marked with a humble 2 leads only to two divisor trails, one originating and one at itself, while a card bearing the more complex 6 connects to four distinct divisor trails. The kingdom\u2019s archivists have a grand task: the number of postcards is vast, stretching into the hundreds of thousands, each inscribed with a number no greater than a million, reflecting the intricate paths beneath Numeria.\n\nThe archivists receive a series of commands designed to both transform and analyze their enchanted collection. Two types of edicts arrive: first, the \u201cTransmute\u201d command, which orders that within a selected stretch of postcards\u2014from one boundary marker to another\u2014the number on each card must be replaced by its very count of divisor trails. This operation can be repeated, elegantly shrinking or reshaping the mystical properties of the cards. Second, the \u201cGather\u201d command requests the grand sum of the numbers on postcards within a certain range, revealing the collective strength of this slice of the network's magic. Every command respects the order and span of the postcards, always staying within their boundaries.\n\nThe archivists must carefully fulfill these commands. They are handed a ledger with the initial count of postcards and the total number of commands. Following this, the inscriptions on all postcards are listed in order. Then come the commands, one per line: each bearing the type of command (1 for Transmute, 2 for Gather), and the start and end positions of the range it affects. It\u2019s well-known that among these commands, at least one will be a Gather command. The archivists\u2019 goal is more than just to execute these commands; they must do so efficiently and completely, ensuring every Transmute reshapes the cards as decreed, and every Gather answers with the exact summation of the numbers preserving the mystical integrity of Numeria\u2019s network.\n\nFor example, consider a realm possessing seven enchanted postcards with inscriptions: six, four, one, ten, three, two, and four. Across six commands, the archivists first fetch the sum from the entire collection, yielding a grand total of thirty. Next, a summon of the sum over the range spanning the fourth and fifth cards yields thirteen, a smaller but still potent slice of magic. They then perform a Transmute on the third through fifth cards, replacing those numbers with their divisor trail counts. A follow-up query fetches the power of the fourth card alone, now revealing a mere four paths. A second Transmute adjusts the stretch from the fifth to the seventh cards, reshaping the final stretch of magic. Lastly, a final Gather over the entire collection reveals a new total of twenty-two, showing the dynamic evolution of the postcards\u2019 arcane properties.\n\nThus, the kingdom\u2019s archivists must report every sum summoned, chronicling the vibrant and changing network of divide and unite that pulses through Numeria\u2019s mystical postcards\u2014each line in their ancient record reflecting the ever-transforming dance of divisor trails beneath their feet.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nLet D(x) be the number of positive divisors of a positive integer x. For example, D(2) = 2 (2 is divisible by 1 and 2), D(6) = 4 (6 is divisible by 1, 2, 3 and 6).\n\nYou are given an array a of n integers. You have to process two types of queries:\n\n1. REPLACE l r \u2014 for every i \\in [l, r] replace ai with D(ai);\n2. SUM l r \u2014 calculate \\sum_{i=l}^{r}a_i.\n\nPrint the answer for each SUM query.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 3\u00b7105) \u2014 the number of elements in the array and the number of queries to process, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 106) \u2014 the elements of the array.\n\nThen m lines follow, each containing 3 integers ti, li, ri denoting i-th query. If ti = 1, then i-th query is REPLACE li ri, otherwise it's SUM li ri (1 \u2264 ti \u2264 2, 1 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264 n).\n\nThere is at least one SUM query.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each SUM query print the answer to it.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n7 6\n6 4 1 10 3 2 4\n2 1 7\n2 4 5\n1 3 5\n2 4 4\n1 5 7\n2 1 7\n\nSample Output 1\n\n30\n13\n4\n22",

This stash wasn\u2019t arranged simply by serial numbers, but by a curious harmony between toys\u2019 identity codes and magical badges. Each toy bore a number, and to be considered \"worthy\" for the Sifter\u2019s collection, a toy's number had to resonate in a certain way with a given badge number, such that they shared no secret divisors other than unity\u2014an ancient rule whispered among the Toy Archivists.\n\nThe archivists set forth a challenge: for each entry in this great catalog, the Sifter was to find toys whose identity numbers were strictly greater than a given starting point, ensuring their magical badge and the toy\u2019s number had no common hidden factors. These toys must be sorted from smallest to largest. To complicate matters, the cataloguers demanded not just any worthy toy but specifically the k-th one in this enchanted sequence, counting from one, as the precise piece to include in the archive. This process would be repeated many times\u2014up to thirty thousand occasions\u2014with varying starting values, badges, and desired positions within the worthy lineup. Each value for the starting point, the badge number, and the position in the lineup was capped by a realm of up to one million, ensuring the Sifter\u2019s talents were pushed to the limit.\n\nYour task, dear compiler, is to automate this legendary Sequence Sifter: given the number of queries and for each query the trio of values\u2014a threshold beyond which toys must appear, the badge number against which worthiness is judged, and the sought position in the sorted worthy sequence\u2014you must reveal the identity number of the toy that precisely matches the k-th place in this mystical ordering. This means you don\u2019t just find one toy or any toy, but the specifically numbered toy that holds the k-th rank after filtering those with no shared divisors with the badge, strictly beyond the starting threshold.\n\nIn the form of input, you first receive the total count of these catalog requests. Then, on each ensuing line, you receive the trio of numbers: first the starting limit beyond which toy numbers must lie, then the badge number heralded as the magical filter, and finally the rank number identifying which toy in the filtered ascending lineup you must report. Your response, the output, is a list of numbers\u2014one per request\u2014each number the identity of the illustrious toy fulfilling the query's conditions.\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s revisit a classic archival challenge: three requests, each beginning just beyond seven, with a badge number of twenty-two. For the first, you seek the very first worthy toy beyond that start; it turns out to be toy number nine. The second query, under the same badge and threshold, seeks the second worthy toy, which is thirteen. The third looks for the third worthy, revealing toy number fifteen. Another batch of five requests with starting points and badges ranging in the forties and identical rank requests yield a sequence of toy identities like one hundred eighty-seven, eighty-seven, one hundred thirty-nine, one hundred twenty-eight, and one hundred forty-one respectively. These values reflect the magic compatibility between badges and toy numbers, filtered and ordered flawlessly within the constraints of the infinite stash.\n\nThus, the Sequence Sifter stands ready\u2014given your input voyage through toys and badges\u2014to conjure the precise toys that fill each place in the infinity of worthy possibilities, a retro archive eternally sorted by ancient rules of harmony.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nLet's denote as L(x, p) an infinite sequence of integers y such that gcd(p, y) = 1 and y > x (where gcd is the greatest common divisor of two integer numbers), sorted in ascending order. The elements of L(x, p) are 1-indexed; for example, 9, 13 and 15 are the first, the second and the third elements of L(7, 22), respectively.\n\nYou have to process t queries. Each query is denoted by three integers x, p and k, and the answer to this query is k-th element of L(x, p).\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 30000) \u2014 the number of queries to process.\n\nThen t lines follow. i-th line contains three integers x, p and k for i-th query (1 \u2264 x, p, k \u2264 106).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint t integers, where i-th integer is the answer to i-th query.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n7 22 1\n7 22 2\n7 22 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n9\n13\n15\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5\n42 42 42\n43 43 43\n44 44 44\n45 45 45\n46 46 46\n\nSample Output 2\n\n187\n87\n139\n128\n141",

        "question_title": "Picking Strings",
        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nBy the soft glow of the museum\u2019s dimmed corridors, Alice the night guard meticulously examines the exhibits. In her journal, she records her observations about a peculiar string of relics made up of three enchanted symbols, each representing a mysterious letter from an ancient language: the first shaped like a triangle, known as the A symbol, the second curved and gentle as a bow, called B, and the third like a pair of interlaced rings, the C. These relics are arranged in a long sequence \u2014 the revered source collection \u2014 while the master archive holds another sequence, the desired target arrangement. The task at hand is to decipher whether portions of the source can be transformed into portions of the target using the museum's arcane rules, as if rearranging, splitting, or disappearing key elements under the watchful moonlight.\n\nThe museum\u2019s secret lies in the lore of transformations. By the guidance of ancient artifacts, any continuous stretch of these symbols\u2014the substrings\u2014can be metamorphosed following a sacred ritual. The first ritual dictates that one triangle-shaped relic may change into a delicate pair of bow-and-rings relics. The second allows the bow-shaped relic to transform similarly into a triangle and a ring. The third ritual applies to the rings, transforming them into a triangle and a bow. These triads shift endlessly in the moonlit halls, revealing cryptic patterns. But the most potent incantation allows exactly three consecutive triangle relics to vanish completely, disappearing into the night, leaving the sequence shorter and the puzzle more intricate. These spells obey unbroken runs of symbols\u2014consecutive spots only\u2014and can be cast any number of times, in any order, on any segment selected from the source sequence.\n\nAlice\u2019s challenge is precise yet daunting. She receives multiple requests from the museum\u2019s scholars asking: \"For the relics resting between positions a through b in the source collection, can they be enchanted through the museum\u2019s rules\u2014through splitting, merging, and vanishing\u2014to manifest exactly as the relics between positions c through d in the target archive?\" Each query looks deeply into whether such alchemical transformation is possible, seeking not only if it can be done at all but also if it can be accomplished in a finite number of ritual steps, within the bounds of the source segment\u2019s length and composition. The source and target sequences may each contain up to one hundred thousand relics, and similarly, the museum scholars may ask up to one hundred thousand such queries, requiring Alice to be both swift and clever.\n\nThe information from the archives comes encoded as follows: First, a single line reveals the entire source sequence of relics. On the very next line, the target sequence appears. Then, the number of urgent scholarly queries arrives, followed by that number of lines. Each line details four numbers, representing positions in the source and target: from the a-th to b-th relic in the source, and from the c-th to d-th relic in the target, respectively. These five sets of information govern Alice\u2019s nightly labor. For each query, she must inscribe a \u20181\u2019 for transformations that are possible and a \u20180\u2019 otherwise. Finally, she compiles the answers into one single string, encoding the festival of successes and failures, a testament to the museum\u2019s magical rigidity.\n\nFor example, under the night\u2019s first inquiry, Alice examines relics from positions one through three in the source and tries to create the sequence from positions one through two in the target. After weaving through the transformations, using the spell that can convert one triangle into bow-ring, then adding triangles and vanishing triples of triangles, she confirms it is possible, marking \u20181\u2019. Another query questions transforming a single bow at position two of the source into a three-symbol sequence from the target; this proves impossible, recorded as \u20180\u2019. Other queries similarly walk through fragments, some yielding to the ancient rules and some with stubborn mismatches\u2014for instance, trying to turn a segment ending in bow relics into just a single triangle fails because the unwanted relics cannot be completely erased. The final response string reflects the balance of magical ease and complexity: \u201810011\u2019. Thus, beneath the soft museum lights, Alice\u2019s reports reveal the intricate dance of symbols, transformations, and vanishings, chronicling the enchanted mysteries that govern the relics' fate.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nAlice has a string consisting of characters 'A', 'B' and 'C'. Bob can use the following transitions on any substring of our string in any order any number of times:\n\n- A \\rightarrow BC\n- B \\rightarrow AC\n- C \\rightarrow AB\n- AAA \\rightarrow empty string\n\nNote that a substring is one or more consecutive characters. For given queries, determine whether it is possible to obtain the target string from source.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a string S (1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 105). The second line contains a string T (1 \u2264 |T| \u2264 105), each of these strings consists only of uppercase English letters 'A', 'B' and 'C'.\n\nThe third line contains the number of queries Q (1 \u2264 Q \u2264 105).\n\nThe following Q lines describe queries. The i-th of these lines contains four space separated integers ai, bi, ci, di. These represent the i-th query: is it possible to create T[ci..di] from S[ai..bi] by applying the above transitions finite amount of times?\n\nHere, U[x..y] is a substring of U that begins at index x (indexed from 1) and ends at index y. In particular, U[1..|U|] is the whole string U.\n\nIt is guaranteed that 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264 |S| and 1 \u2264 c \u2264 d \u2264 |T|.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint a string of Q characters, where the i-th character is '1' if the answer to the i-th query is positive, and '0' otherwise.\n\nSample Input 1\n\nAABCCBAAB\nABCB\n5\n1 3 1 2\n2 2 2 4\n7 9 1 1\n3 4 2 3\n4 5 1 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n10011\n\nNote\nIn the first query we can achieve the result, for instance, by using transitions AAB \\rightarrow AAAC \\rightarrow AAAAB \\rightarrow AB.\n\nThe third query asks for changing AAB to A\u00a0\u2014 but in this case we are not able to get rid of the character 'B'.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the dim-lit sanctum of the Ancient Archive, where scrolls whispered the secrets of symmetry and balance, a Puzzlekeeper was tasked with untangling an enigmatic script. This manuscript was peculiar\u2014etched with an even number of delicate runes, all from a sacred alphabet of the lowliest Latin glyphs. The script's length stretched far, never less than two runes and never more than a million runes multiplied by ten times ten thousand, a vast tapestry cloaked in mystery. The Puzzlekeeper\u2019s charge was to decipher how many harmonious partitions of this script existed, following the eternal laws of mirrored harmony.\n\nWithin this realm, the laws of harmony decreed that the script must be split into a series of magical fragments, an even number of them, each fragment a substring taken from the sacred runes without overlap or omission. The true arcane edict demanded that each fragment balanced perfectly with a counterpart on the opposite end of the sequence \u2014 the first fragment standing as a mirror to the last, the second as a mirror to the penultimate, and so forth, ensuring flawless symmetry. This was no trivial task, for each pairing had to be a perfect echo, and the total count of these mirrored shards had to be an even number\u2014never odd, never partial. The art was to find not just any partition but all possible partitions that honored this mirror dance throughout the entire spell.\n\nThe Puzzlekeeper\u2019s challenge was to count these balanced partitions with utmost accuracy, for their number could swell beyond the highest numbers told in legends and histories. To keep the numbers from spiraling into chaos, the count had to be revealed only after embracing the ancient modulus decree \u2014 they must be presented as the remainder when divided by a vast prime, known throughout the Archive as one billion plus seven. Every possible partition that fulfilled the sacred symmetry laws contributed to this final count, transforming the problem from a mere puzzle into a grand quest for comprehensive understanding.\n\nWhen a seeker approached to offer a script, they would first state the entire sequence of runes on a single precious line in the archive's ledger, abiding by the unyielding requirement that the spell's length was even and composed solely of these humble Latin symbols. Upon receiving this, the Puzzlekeeper would inscribe on the next line the tally of all partitions that upheld the mirrored fragment law, the number carefully reduced by the ancient prime to keep clarity and order.\n\nIn one whispered example, a simple chain of runes \"abcdcdab\" was presented. The Puzzlekeeper revealed there was but a single way to cleave it perfectly into fragments that mirrored each other\u2014split the spell as \"ab | cd | cd | ab\" to conjure symmetry at its purest. Another, more intricate incantation \"abbababababbab\" yielded a curious thrice-counted answer, for it could be divided into fragments in several harmonious ways, such as \"ab | b | ab | ab | ab | ab | b | ab,\" or \"ab | b | abab | abab | b | ab,\" or even \"abbab | ab | ab | abbab,\" each honoring the same mirrored pact.\n\nThus, the Puzzlekeeper\u2019s sacred scrolls stood testament to the harmony of reflected fragments, the counting of all symmetrical partitions woven into the very fabric of the archiving lore\u2014a riddle bound not by mere letters, but by the ancient dance of equality and balance beneath the stars of the Latin alphabet.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nGiven a string s, find the number of ways to split s to substrings such that if there are k substrings (p1, p2, p3, ..., pk) in partition, then pi = pk - i + 1 for all i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k) and k is even.\n\nSince the number of ways can be large, print it modulo 109 + 7.\n\nInput Format\nThe only line of input contains a string s (2 \u2264 |s| \u2264 106) of even length consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput Format\nPrint one integer, the number of ways of partitioning the string modulo 109 + 7.\n\nSample Input 1\n\nabcdcdab\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\n\nSample Input 2\n\nabbababababbab\n\nSample Output 2\n\n3\n\nNote\nIn the first case, the only way to partition the string is ab|cd|cd|ab.\n\nIn the second case, the string can be partitioned as ab|b|ab|ab|ab|ab|b|ab or ab|b|abab|abab|b|ab or abbab|ab|ab|abbab.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nWelcome to the Alien Zoo Containment Manual, where the conservation of peculiar energy flows between creatures constitutes the essence of peace and stability in this interstellar menagerie. Within a linear arrangement of habitats, called the Energy Array, a sequence of n alien creatures reside, each radiating a distinct positive level of energy. Here, the measure of the array\u2019s vibrancy is defined by the sum of the energy differences between each neighboring pair of habitats. Thus, the vitality of the Zoo is captured by the total of all absolute differences between the energy emissions of adjacent creatures.\n\nThe rules governing these alien habitats are strict and refined. Each creature\u2019s energy level is positive, and the habitats are arrayed in a strict line, no fewer than three and no more than one hundred thousand beacons long. Between any two adjacent creatures, the Zoo's energy pulse is influenced by the magnitude of the energy gap \u2014 measured strictly as the positive span between their emitted energies. The keepers perform two crucial operations per protocol: sometimes, they can select a contiguous set of habitats and collectively increase their energy levels by a specified magnitude, a universal boost over that range. At other times, they simulate a scenario: selecting a subrange within the habitats and a particular energy magnitude, they guess how best to enhance the energy of just one single creature within that subrange by that amount to maximize the total pulsation of energy differences between all neighbors \u2014 but this guesswork must never alter the actual energy levels at the moment.\n\nOutpost analysts have a task \u2014 to monitor q such operations. Each operation is one of two kinds: the first kind queries the highest possible increase in the Zoo's total energy pulse achievable by adding a certain magnitude of energy to exactly one habitat somewhere within a specified segment of the array. The second kind commands the real-time escalation of energy levels for every creature within a particular contiguous segment by a given amount. After each first-kind query, the analysts must report the maximal possible increase, but the true arrangement of energies remains untouched during these hypothetical assessments. The goal is to answer all these investigations swiftly and precisely, ensuring stability in containment is not compromised while maximizing vibrancy understanding.\n\nTo input the scenario, the keepers first provide the number of habitats, ensuring it lies between three and one hundred thousand. On the next line, they record the initial emissions \u2014 the positive energy values of each creature across the habitat array. Following this, the number of operations q is declared, also bound by a hundred thousand at most. For each operation, a description comes next: first, the type indicator (either 1 for a hypothetical maximization query or 2 for a real increment command), followed by two positions marking the inclusive segment within the array (strictly inside the array boundaries, not touching the very first or last creature), and finally the energy magnitude involved in that operation. The keepers know at least one operation will be a hypothesis to maximize pulsations, ensuring meaningful outputs.\n\nFor instance, consider a Zoo array of five creatures each starting at energy level one, and five operations ranging from hypothetical energy boosts on segments 2 to 4 to real increments on inner segments, resulting in answers two and eight when simulating the first kind. Alternatively, a more diverse initial setup from one through five with four operations exhibits maximal energy pulsations six and ten when assessing hypothetical boosts after increments. Each such result reveals the potential for amplifying the Zoo\u2019s energy configuration without destabilizing the current setup \u2014 a clever balance between dream and duty in alien energy containment.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nFafa has an array A of n positive integers, the function f(A) is defined as \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} |a_i - a_{i+1}|. He wants to do q queries of two types:\n\n- 1 l r x \u2014 find the maximum possible value of f(A), if x is to be added to one element in the range [l, r]. You can choose to which element to add x.\n- 2 l r x \u2014 increase all the elements in the range [l, r] by value x.\n\nNote that queries of type 1 don't affect the array elements.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 105) \u2014 the length of the array.\n\nThe second line contains n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 < ai \u2264 109) \u2014 the array elements.\n\nThe third line contains an integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 105) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nThen q lines follow, line i describes the i-th query and contains four integers ti li ri xi ( t _ { i } \\in \\{ 1, 2 \\}, 1 < l _ { i } \\leq r _ { i } < n, 0 < x _ { i } \\leq 1 0 ^ { 9 } ).\n\nIt is guaranteed that at least one of the queries is of type 1.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each query of type 1, print the answer to the query.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n1 1 1 1 1\n5\n1 2 4 1\n2 2 3 1\n2 4 4 2\n2 3 4 1\n1 3 3 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n8\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n4\n1 2 4 2\n2 2 4 1\n2 3 4 1\n1 2 4 2\n\nSample Output 2\n\n6\n10",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the ancient realm of Numeria, the Hero was summoned to undertake a trial unlike any other. The lands were shaped by a great line of enchanted stones, each bearing a secret power inscribed with a number. There were many stones, possibly as many as a million, each glowing with a radiant value no greater than the celestial peak of a billion\u2019s magnitude. The Hero\u2019s challenge was to explore the countless ways the gods could arrange these stones in a procession to observe the flow of power through the line.\n\nThe sacred law of the realm declared a mystical ritual: begin with the first stone chosen as the mark of might, and start the count at zero. Then, moving step-by-step through the stones from the second on, if the new stone\u2019s strength exceeded that of the current mark, the Hero must add the previous mark's power to a running total\u2014a tribute to the old king before the new king\u2019s claim\u2014and then set this stronger stone as the new mark. This ritual, conducted over all the divine permutations of the stones\u2014each permutation a unique festival where every stone is distinct through its place in the procession\u2014defines a grand measure of power the Hero must gather.\n\nThe Hero\u2019s quest is to find the sum of all such grand measures, accumulated over every possible sacred arrangement of stones. However, only the remainder when divided by the divine modulus of one billion plus seven must be presented to the Oracle, for the universe's balance hinges on this sacred numeric boundary. The count of stones, the strength of each stone, and the sheer immensity of the arrangements, which grow faster than the stars climb the sky, make this task a formidable test of wisdom and endurance.\n\nTo record the ancient scrolls of the trial, the first line gives the number of stones in the procession. Then, on the very next line, their powers appear in a solemn sequence. The Hero must then inscribe a single number that tells the Oracle the complete sum of the grand measures across all permutations, tamed by the mystical modulus. This ensures that the overwhelming expanse of possibilities can be held within a bounded cosmic order.\n\nIn one known tale from the archives, when the stones\u2019 powers were but two\u2014a single weak stone followed by a mightier one\u2014the sum of all the grand rituals was exactly one. In another chronicle, with three stones held, two weak and one strong, the total tribute across all permutations was four, the count born from six distinct festivals where sometimes strength shone early, sometimes late, and sometimes never shifted at all.\n\nThus, the Hero must navigate the infinite tempest of permutations, honoring every shift in mark and every tribute paid, to unveil the sacred sum beneath the vast cloak of the universe\u2019s divine modulus. Only then can the Hero claim victory in the Trial of the Enchanted Stones, bringing balance and wisdom back to Numeria\u2019s eternal light.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given an array a of length n. We define fa the following way:\n\n- Initially fa = 0, M = 1;\n- for every 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n if aM < ai then we set fa = fa + aM and then set M = i.\n\nCalculate the sum of fa over all n! permutations of the array a modulo 109 + 7.\n\nNote: two elements are considered different if their indices differ, so for every array a there are exactly n! permutations.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000 000) \u2014 the size of array a.\n\nSecond line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 109).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the only integer, the sum of fa over all n! permutations of the array a modulo 109 + 7.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n2\n1 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3\n1 1 2\n\nSample Output 2\n\n4\n\nNote\nFor the second example all the permutations are:\n\n- p = [1, 2, 3] : fa is equal to 1;\n- p = [1, 3, 2] : fa is equal to 1;\n- p = [2, 1, 3] : fa is equal to 1;\n- p = [2, 3, 1] : fa is equal to 1;\n- p = [3, 1, 2] : fa is equal to 0;\n- p = [3, 2, 1] : fa is equal to 0.\n\nWhere p is the array of the indices of initial array a.

This is because for a single element, `fa` is simply the element itself.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming:**\n   - The code iterates through subarray lengths (`length`) from 2 to `n`.\n   - For each length, it iterates through possible starting indices (`i`) of the subarray.\n   - `j` is calculated as the ending index of the subarray (`i + length - 1`).\n   - The inner loop iterates through possible split points (`k`) within the subarray.\n   - `dp[i][j]` is updated by summing the contributions from all possible splits at `k`. The contribution is calculated as `dp[i][k] * dp[k + 1][j]`, representing the sum of `fa` for the left and right subarrays multiplied together.\n\n4. **Result:**\n   - Finally, `dp[0][n - 1]` contains the sum of `fa` for all permutations of the entire array `a`. This value is returned as the answer.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Modulus:** The `% MOD` operation is used throughout the calculations to prevent integer overflow and keep the results within the desired range.\n- **Dynamic Programming:** The `dp` array stores intermediate results, avoiding redundant calculations and improving efficiency.\n- **Permutation Handling:** The algorithm implicitly considers all permutations by iterating through all possible subarray lengths and split points.\n\n\n\n",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn a world where time travelers manipulate moments in history like threads in a tapestry, there exists a strict protocol for how fragments of time can be erased to achieve the purest possible timeline. Each timeline is represented by a sequence of ancient symbols\u2014lowercase letters whispered through ages\u2014that define its essence.\n\nThe Guardians of Time hold the decree: from the original sequence, whose length may stretch into the thousands but never beyond a few thousand moments, they must perform a number of precise excisions dictated by the nature of the timeline\u2019s length. Specifically, the count of these excisions is determined by how many times the timeline\u2019s length can be halved before it becomes less than one whole moment\u2014that is, the floor of the logarithm base two of the timeline\u2019s length. For the first excision, a patch of exactly one moment must be removed; for the second, a chunk of exactly three moments; for the third, a wound of five moments; and so it continues, increasing in odd-sized segments that precisely match twice the excision count minus one.\n\nThe task placed upon you, as a custodian of these timelines, is to sever such fragments one after another, each of the exact sizes decreed by the protocol, chosen anywhere within the current sequence. These excisions must be done in sequence\u2014first the smallest odd segment, then the next larger odd segment, and so forth\u2014until all prescribed cuts are made. With every cut, the timeline\u2019s essence shrinks, but your goal is not just to comply with the ritual but to craft the timeline that is lexicographically earliest\u2014meaning the most orderly and pure chain of moments starting with the smallest letters by the ancient alphabet, as if you are weaving the history that sings the softest, most harmonious melody of time.\n\nThe experiment begins with a single line of input: the original string of moments, a melody of lowercase letters whose length may range anywhere from a single note up to five thousand intertwined threads. After carrying out all the excisions precisely as dictated, you will reveal a single line of final history\u2014the sequence of moments that remain, pared down to its lexically minimal form after this temporal refinement.\n\nConsider these chronicles of past operations:  \nFirst, the timeline \u201cadcbca\u201d began as six moments. The protocol mandated two excisions\u2014first removing a solitary moment, then a trio of moments\u2014leading finally to a serene sequence \u201caba,\u201d where the melody is as gentle and ordered as a whispered lullaby.  \nIn another saga, \u201cabacabadabacaba,\u201d richer and longer, the Guardians commanded four incisions matching the odd-sized sequence of lengths: one, three, five, and seven moments. The outcome was a refined history: \u201caabacaba,\u201d subtle yet profoundly ordered, where each excision sculpted the melody toward perfection.\n\nThrough this protocol, you are entrusted to transform any given timeline into its purest form by wisely selecting and removing these prescribed odd-length strands, rendering an endpoint that is not only correct but lexicographically the most harmonious.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a string s, initially consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. After that, you perform k operations with it, where k = \\left\\lfloor \\log_2(n) \\right\\rfloor. During i-th operation you must erase some substring of length exactly 2i - 1 from s.\n\nPrint the lexicographically minimal string you may obtain after performing k such operations.\n\nInput Format\nThe only line contains one string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters (1 \u2264 n \u2264 5000).\n\nOutput Format\nPrint the lexicographically minimal string you may obtain after performing k operations.\n\nSample Input 1\n\nadcbca\n\nSample Output 1\n\naba\n\nSample Input 2\n\nabacabadabacaba\n\nSample Output 2\n\naabacaba\n\nNote\nPossible operations in examples:\n\n1. adcbca \\rightarrow adcba \\rightarrow aba;\n2. abacabadabacaba \\rightarrow abcabadabacaba \\rightarrow aabadabacaba \\rightarrow aabacaba.",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the shadowy pages of an ancient Witch\u2019s Alchemy Book, there lies a curious riddle about numbers of peculiar beauty. These numbers are not just ordinary figures; they shimmer with a secret harmony. They come alive when their form contains an even count of mystical digits\u2014no less, no more\u2014and their essence can be rearranged to create a magical mirror, a palindrome that reads the same forward and backward. Such an enchanted number might be like the chant \u201c4242,\u201d whose digits can dance into the reflection \u201c2442,\u201d revealing its symmetrical soul.\n\nThe great sorcerer, studying these mystic integers, has set forth a challenge across the realm. The number scrolls arrive in batches\u2014one scroll tells how many enchantments must be uncovered. Each subsequent scroll carries a single grand number, already bearing an even count of digits and no leading charms of zero, assuring that hidden within the lands of numbers is at least one beautiful number just beneath it. The length of these magical strings combined shall never overflow such arcane limits as 200,000 digits, keeping the realm\u2019s balance intact.\n\nYour quest, dear seeker, is to traverse these scrolls and for each grand number revealed, summon forth the greatest beautiful number that exists just shy of that symbol\u2019s power. Not merely any smaller number will suffice; it must be the most grand, the most beautiful number before it, fitting the twin conditions of even length and palindromic potential in any digit arrangement. This is no simple counting; this is a careful dance to honor the ancient numeric symphony, ensuring no leading zero disrupts the order, and that the palindromic permutation lives within the newly found figure.\n\nThrough the coven\u2019s guidance, the input arrives thus: first, the count of mystical tests scrolls\u2014how many trials you must face. Then, each test spirit manifests as a line of digits, large and powerful, always bearing an even number of digits and free from leading zero-like curses. The task\u2019s output, the incantation you must etch on new scrolls, is the beautiful number that stands largest yet clear below each grand number called. Each answer is a single line of digits, shimmering with the palindromic magic and satisfying the ancient rules, glowing with the truth that such a number always exists in the shadows.\n\nTo glimpse the secrets through the coven\u2019s sample scrolls: with the challenge of four tests, the first calls for the grand number near \u201c89,\u201d where the largest beautiful is \u201c88,\u201d a mirrored pair that sings in twin eights. Next, from the \u201888\u2019 scroll itself springs \u201c77,\u201d stepping just one step aside to a simpler beauty. Faced with \u201c1000,\u201d the number \u201c99\u201d gleams as the beautiful sentinel closest beneath, a duo of nines holding palindromic grace. Lastly, the vast number \u201c28923845\u201d births the beautiful \u201c28923839,\u201d closely trailing, its digits rearrangeable into a symmetrical spell.\n\nThus, the haunted pages close on this numeric enchantment, where to solve is not just to find any beauty, but to summon the greatest beauty allowed, beneath the grand number heralded by each test. May your alchemical wisdom guide your hand in revealing these spellbound treasures.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYes, that's another problem with definition of \"beautiful\" numbers.\n\nLet's call a positive integer x beautiful if its decimal representation without leading zeroes contains even number of digits, and there exists a permutation of this representation which is palindromic. For example, 4242 is a beautiful number, since it contains 4 digits, and there exists a palindromic permutation 2442.\n\nGiven a positive integer s, find the largest beautiful number which is less than s.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 105) \u2014 the number of testcases you have to solve.\n\nThen t lines follow, each representing one testcase and containing one string which is the decimal representation of number s. It is guaranteed that this string has even length, contains no leading zeroes, and there exists at least one beautiful number less than s.\n\nThe sum of lengths of s over all testcases doesn't exceed 2\u00b7105.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase print one line containing the largest beautiful number which is less than s (it is guaranteed that the answer exists).\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4\n89\n88\n1000\n28923845\n\nSample Output 1\n\n88\n77\n99\n28923839",

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the forgotten heart of a once-celebrated theme park lay an ancient blueprint, detailing a series of winding paths adorned by monuments of growth and progress. These were known as the Ascending Steps\u2014stone slabs arranged in lines, each slab towering just above the last, creating a perfect upward climb. The city\u2019s elders had long recognized these steps as symbols of hope, insisting that followers walk only along sequences where every stone rises higher than the one before it. Yet time had cruelly scattered these stones, and some sequences had lost their perfect rise, crumbling into disorder.\n\nAccording to the park\u2019s laws, a path of stones could be deemed \u201calmost ascending\u201d if it could be restored to a strictly rising formation simply by removing one troublesome slab\u2014or none at all if it already met the criteria. But the city\u2019s restoration artisans were granted a secret power: they could transform any stone\u2019s height to any new magnitude they desired, repeatedly if need be. However, each transformation was costly, and their aim was to revive the Ascending Steps with as few alterations as possible. The challenge was vast, for the number of stones in a single path could stretch up to two hundred thousand, and each stone\u2019s original height could span across a realm as broad as a billion magical units.\n\nIn this realm, the elders summoned a skilled architect to examine a particular stone sequence, penned down in their mystical ledger. The architect first learned how many stones there were in the path, spoken aloud as a single number. Next, on the following line, the original heights of each stone were revealed in order. The architect\u2019s mission was clear: determine the least number of stone height changes required so that by possibly removing one flawed stone, the entire path became a flawless ascending stretch. If the path was already perfect or required no removals, the goal was to confirm that no transformations were necessary.\n\nOnce the architect completed the divine calculations, they were to announce a single number: the minimal count of height transformations needed to breathe life back into the \u201calmost ascending\u201d path. For example, when presented with a descending chain of five stones measuring five, four, three, two, and one, the architect discerned that at least three stones required a transformation to fix the path.

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the shifting chambers of the Space-Time Puzzle Labyrinth, every traveler carries a unique collection of cosmic orbs\u2014each orb named by a sacred script and bearing the essence of one of two fundamental energies: the soft or the hard. These energies govern how orbs interact and fuse within the labyrinth\u2019s maze, shaping the flow of time and space itself. A traveler\u2019s bundle, composed of many such orbs, must be carefully balanced; the labyrinth\u2019s ancient protocols decree that no two orbs differing in essence may occupy the same temporal node, as their energies would destabilize and fracture reality.\n\nNow, consider a traveler who holds a precious cache of orbs\u2014each marked by a distinctive glyph of lowercase letters, ranging in length from a single rune to a string of ten. The traveler declares how many orbs they possess, up to a century\u2019s worth, and then lists each orb\u2019s name along with its energy type, either the gentle \u201csoft\u201d or the solid \u201chard.\u201d Each orb in the cache is unique in its designation, ensuring no confusion in the labyrinth\u2019s flow.\n\nThe challenge laid before this traveler is formidable: within the constraints of their collection, they must seek the greatest number of harmonious temporal nodes to partition their orbs. Each node may only hold orbs all bathed in the same energy essence; no mixing soft and hard at a single node is permitted. The traveler\u2019s goal is not merely to arrange their orbs but to segment them into as many distinct nodes as the energies and names allow\u2014splitting into the maximum number of time-stable clusters, each cluster pure in its energetic identity.\n\nTo measure the traveler\u2019s success, they submit their list of orbs to the labyrinth\u2019s temporal core in a strict format\u2014a single number stating how many orbs are carried, given on the first temporal pulse. Following this pulse, each subsequent pulse announces one orb\u2019s name and its energy essence, separated clearly by the labyrinth\u2019s logic paths of space. The labyrinth then returns a single integer: the highest count of pure-energy temporal nodes achievable through the traveler\u2019s careful sorting.\n\nFor instance, a traveler bearing nine orbs\u2014five with the tranquil essence and four charged with a rigid force\u2014discovers they can sculpt their collection into three stable temporal nodes. Another traveler with six orbs, all solid in nature, manages to partition theirs into four nodes, extracting maximum spatial and temporal efficiency. These results showcase how the labyrinth\u2019s rule of energy purity governs the unfolding dance of orbs and the traveler\u2019s mastery in maximizing the labyrinth\u2019s nodal harmony.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nNot to be confused with chessboard.\n\nInput Format\nThe first line of input contains a single integer N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of cheeses you have.\n\nThe next N lines describe the cheeses you have.

The network\u2019s operations spread through a sprawling web of safehouses interconnected by secret tunnels. Each safehouse, from the bustling Station Two to the isolated Station N, forms a nexus in this labyrinth. This web forms a tree-like hierarchy, with the Root at the center, and every other safehouse connected by exactly one secret passage, so the entire network is connected with no cycles, ensuring stealthy passage among stations.\n\nIn this clandestine world, the chieftain plans elite heist formations called \"K-ary Divisions\" designed with layers. A Division\u2019s depth speaks to how many layers of reliable sub-leaders it holds. At depth one, even a single safehouse acting independently is considered an elite division of that order. For greater depths, the formation must prove its prowess: a safehouse leading a Division of depth M must command at least K sub-leaders, each running Divisions at a depth no less than M-1. In other words, the formation\u2019s strength grows recursively, relying on the number of capable deputies beneath it. The power of a safehouse\u2019s subtree \u2014 its haven and all connected stations beneath its command \u2014 is measured by the maximum depth of a K-ary Division it can muster there.\n\nYour mission, as the grand strategist, is to sum up the entire potential might of the network \u2014 by calculating for every possible number of required deputies, K (from a bare minimum of one to the entire number of safehouses), and for every safehouse, the greatest depth Division it can support within that safehouse\u2019s domain. You must uncover the combined strength by adding all these maximum depths across every safehouse and every K-value, aiming to reveal the total layered capacity of the network\u2019s heist formations.\n\nAs intelligence arrives, you receive the map: first, the total number of safehouses the network commands. This is followed by a list of passages connecting these sanctuaries, each line describing a direct pathway between two stations. With this map, you analyze and calculate. Your final report must be a single number \u2014 the grand total of all the maximum depths of K-ary Divisions across all safehouses and all K-values \u2014 no more, no less.\n\nConsider one such network of four safehouses connected to a hub station. When divis\u00e3o size K climbs beyond three, the maximum depth any Division attains is just one, a barebones structure barely holding together. For K equal to two, some stations can gather Divisions at depth two, some only at one. And when K is one, the depths vary among stations\u2014some can organize deeper chains of command, others less so. Adding all these respective depths together, weighted properly across stations and K-values, reveals the total force the network can muster, like the sum being twenty-one in this sample. In another arrangement where stations lie in a chain, the force value shifts to twenty-two, showing how structure shapes strength. Your challenge is to uncover these sums for any such network, revealing the hidden potential of the network\u2019s heist command tree.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou're given a tree with n vertices rooted at 1.\n\nWe say that there's a k-ary heap of depth m located at u if the following holds:\n\n- For m = 1 u itself is a k-ary heap of depth 1.\n- For m > 1 vertex u is a k-ary heap of depth m if at least k of its children are k-ary heaps of depth at least m - 1.\n\nDenote dpk(u) as maximum depth of k-ary heap in the subtree of u (including u).

        "question_content": "### Narrative format:\nIn the enchanted realm of Sugarveil, there existed a legendary Candy Factory where magical recipes were crafted from mystical numbers known as the Sprites of Bitland. The factory\u2019s master confectioners dealt with magical sets of these Sprites, each Sprite embodying a secret code between zero and a shimmering boundary shaped by the power of two raised to a certain enchanted number N. This number N could range from nothingness itself\u2014no dimensional magic\u2014to the grand limit defined by 22 spells cast upon the factory walls, granting a colossal variety of Sprites, though never surpassing that limit. The factory operated with a guild of precisely M unique Sprites, where M could never be more than all possible Sprites allowed by the mystical boundary.\n\nThe enchanted guild had a curious tradition. They would conjure connections between the Sprites depending on a delicate ritual: two Sprites would be linked by a luminous candy thread if and only if when their magic codes were combined with the ancient \"AND\" charm, the spell rendered absolutely no shared magic\u2014meaning their magical essence did not overlap at all. This was no ordinary link; it was a bond that only formed if the combined charm of the pair resulted in utter neutralization, a proof of pure distinctness in their magical bits. Each bond was unbreakable yet undirected\u2014the connection flowed equally, with no gesture of hierarchy in their sweetness alliance.\n\nWithin this Candy Factory, the grand challenge awaited: given a particular collection of M Sprites, each distinctly selected and known by their unique magical code within that sparkling range, the master confectioners sought to uncover how many distinct clusters of these Sprites existed when joined by these magical candy threads. These clusters\u2014connected communities of Sprite friends\u2014were formed through these AND-neutral connections, directly or by hopping through others. The goal was clear: discover exactly how many solitary or linked groups of Sprite magic were present within the given recipe, capturing the essence of community in the Candy Factory\u2019s mystical web.\n\nThe input to the confection was delivered through a secret parchment: first, a single line revealing N and M, defining the magical space and the count of Sprites selected. Following this, on the very next line, the unique magic codes of each Sprite were inscribed, each less than the largest code defined by the might of two raised by N, ensuring every Sprite was truly unique in its magic. The task was to output, in a single enchanted whisper, the exact count of these candy-threaded clans\u2014the connected clusters born of pure no-overlap magic.\n\nFor example, consider the slightest sugar swirl where N was two and M was three, and the Sprites\u2019 codes shimmered as 1, 2, and 3. When the master confectioners wove their bonds, they found two enchanted clusters shimmering distinctly, revealing two connected realms of Sprite magic. In a more elaborate spell with N as five and M as five, and Sprites whispered as 5, 19, 10, 20, and 12, the factory again uncovered two connected communities serenely sparkling via those neutralizing bonds. These outcomes, revealed through mystical vision, were a testament to the magical interplay within the Candy Factory\u2019s ever-enchanting recipe creation.\n\nThus, the secret of the Candy Factory was not just about mixing magical integers but understanding how their bonds formed or broke, creating clusters of sugary alliances through the sacred AND-zero charm. Every set of Sprites hummed with invisible threads, and the master confectioners\u2019 greatest joy was to unveil how many sparkling connected families danced within the magical network\u2014knowing that within their sweet world, unity was a magical recipe to treasure and count carefully.\n\n### Coding Test format:\nYou are given a set of size m with integer elements between 0 and 2^{n}-1 inclusive.
