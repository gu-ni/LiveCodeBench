For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).\n    The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)\n    includes both start and end.\n    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.\n    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two \n    intervals is a prime number.\n    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)\n    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.\n    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return \"YES\",\n    otherwise, return \"NO\".\n    If the two intervals don't intersect, return \"NO\".\n\n\n    [input/output] samples:\n    intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> \"NO\"\n    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> \"NO\"\n    intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> \"YES\"\n    \"\"\"\n",

The expression `string[:i+1]` generates a slice of the string from the beginning up to the `i-th` character (inclusive), effectively creating a prefix of the string. The `range(len(string))` generates numbers from 0 to the length of the string, which are used as the upper bound for the slice. The result is a list of all prefixes, from the shortest (a single character) to the longest (the entire string).",

The `encode()` method is used to convert the string to bytes, which is what the `hashlib.md5()` function expects. The `hexdigest()` method is then used to get the MD5 hash as a hexadecimal string. If the input string is empty, the function returns `None`."

If a number is not in the dictionary, it is added to the dictionary and the result list. This way, we ensure that each number is only added to the result list once, and the order of elements is preserved.",

In `encode_shift`, each character is shifted 5 positions forward in the alphabet. To reverse this, we shift each character 5 positions backward in the alphabet. The expression `ord(ch) - 5 - ord(\"a\")` calculates the new position of the character in the alphabet, and the expression `((ord(ch) - 5 - ord(\"a\")) % 26) + ord(\"a\")` ensures that the result wraps around the alphabet if necessary.",

The `ord` function is used to get the ASCII value of each character, and then we subtract 5 from it (to shift it back by 5 positions), take the result modulo 26 to handle cases where the character is at the end of the alphabet, and finally add the ASCII value of 'a' to get the decoded character.
