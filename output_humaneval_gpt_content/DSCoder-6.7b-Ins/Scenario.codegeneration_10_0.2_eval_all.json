        "question_content": "In the distant realm of Numeria, the ancient Order of the Equidistants presides over the Council of Stones\u2014a sacred ring of mystical stones, each imbued with a unique aura of strength, measured by ethereal energies only the wise can discern. Each stone\u2019s strength is a floating-point value along the infinite Numerian spectrum. According to the custom of Numeria, harmony is only achieved when no two stones resonate so closely that their energies become indistinguishable to the senses.\n\nThe Council\u2019s harmony is governed by the Law of Proximity. This law states that if any two stones in the ring resonate with such similar strengths that the absolute difference between their energies is less than a threshold set by the High Oracle, then discord will arise in the Council. The Oracle alone decides this threshold\u2014a mystical number that marks the minimum safe distance between the energies of two stones. The Order\u2019s challenge is to determine whether the current arrangement of stones leads to harmony or discord.\n\nEach time a new assembly of stones is considered, the Order gathers the list of all the stones\u2019 strengths and the Oracle\u2019s chosen threshold for the day. Their task is to inspect every possible pair of stones and to divine whether there exists at least one pair whose energies are closer than the sacred threshold. If even a single such pair is found, the Council is thrown into discord; otherwise, peace reigns.\n\nWhen the Order receives a new petition, it is presented in the following manner: First, the number of stones is declared, followed by the list of their strengths in order, and finally, the threshold chosen by the Oracle is specified. In Numeria\u2019s records, the report is simply inscribed as either \u201cTrue\u201d (if discord is inevitable\u2014meaning at least one pair of stones is too close) or \u201cFalse\u201d (if peace prevails\u2014no two stones are closer than the threshold). The Order values an answer that is both decisive and determined with utmost efficiency, regardless of how many stones the Council holds.\n\nLet us witness two such petitions, preserved in the Tome of Trials. In the first, the stones bear strengths of one-point-zero, two-point-zero, and three-point-zero, with the Oracle setting the threshold at zero-point-five. The Order, checking every pair, finds no stones too close; thus, peace prevails and \u201cFalse\u201d is inscribed in the annals. In the second, the stones gather with strengths of one-point-zero, two-point-eight, three-point-zero, four-point-zero, five-point-zero, and two-point-zero, and the threshold is set at zero-point-three. Here, the Order discovers the stones of two-point-eight and three-point-zero resonate within the forbidden proximity, and so the record reads \u201cTrue.\u201d\n\nThus, in Numeria, the Order\u2019s task is ever clear: given the list of stones\u2019 strengths and the Oracle\u2019s threshold, declare with certainty whether harmony is possible or discord is inevitable among the Council of Stones.",

        "question_content": "Certainly! Here is your narrative transformation, following all your guidelines:\n\n---\n\nIn the enigmatic city of Parenthesia, the language of thought is inscribed not with words, but with symbols of curves\u2014each phrase spoken or written as an intricate dance of arches and loops. The citizens communicate in strings of left-leaning and right-leaning glyphs, which outsiders might recognize as parentheses. These symbols, when perfectly paired and properly arranged, form what the Parenthesians call \u201cthought groups\u201d\u2014coherent units of meaning, never overlapping, and always perfectly balanced. \n\nIt is a time-honored tradition in Parenthesia that every message, though it may appear as a single winding string, is actually a sequence of distinct thought groups. No group ever starts before the previous one finishes\u2014there is no nesting of one group inside another. Instead, the groups stand side by side, each an island of balance, opening and closing in harmony. The city\u2019s scholars have always been able to identify the boundaries of each group, ignoring the spaces between them, for spaces are mere pauses with no weight in the Parenthesian tongue.\n\nOne day, the Council of Scribes tasks you\u2014a skilled Interpreter\u2014with a crucial role: to devise a method that, when given any message as a single string of parentheses (possibly scattered with spaces), can swiftly and accurately separate the message into its individual thought groups. Each resulting group must be balanced\u2014every opening curve must find its closing partner\u2014and no group may contain another within its boundaries. Your work must be efficient, capable of handling messages as long as the city\u2019s ancient scrolls.\n\nTo fulfill your duty, you must follow the city\u2019s protocol: the Interpreter receives a single message as input, composed solely of left and right curves, along with possibly some spaces. The Interpreter\u2019s response must be a list, in order, of all the distinct thought groups found within, each group represented as a string of perfectly paired curves, with all spaces discarded. Your task is not simply to check for correctness, but to ensure that every group is captured precisely as it stands, making sure none are missed or combined.\n\nConsider, for example, a message that appears as a sequence: a single pair, then a group of two pairs nested, then a more elaborate group with intertwining pairs. In Parenthesia, this might be written as:\n\n**Input**:  \n( ) (( )) (( )( ))\n\n**Expected Output**:  \n['()', '(())', '(()())']\n\nHere, the Interpreter recognizes three thought groups: a simple pair, a doubled nest, and a more intricate structure, each standing alone\u2014translating them into the pure forms that the Council desires.\n\nThus, through your efforts, every message in Parenthesia may be understood and preserved, ensuring that the beauty and logic of the city\u2019s language continues unbroken across the ages.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Mirraville, whispers told of a peculiar practice among its scribes. Within their grand library, every scroll was judged not just by the wisdom it held, but by the hidden symmetry in its words. To the scholars of Mirraville, true beauty in writing meant that a message, when read from the first word to the last, would echo identically when read backwards. Such scrolls were named \u201cpalindromes,\u201d and their crafting was an honored art.\n\nThe scribes\u2019 council laid down strict principles for this tradition. Whenever a new scroll was presented, it was inspected to see if it already mirrored itself perfectly. If so, it was deemed complete and entered into the vault without alteration. But if the scroll\u2019s message faltered in symmetry, the scribe was required to extend it\u2014using only the simplest magic. They must add the fewest possible words (or letters) to the end of the message so that the entire scroll would finally reflect itself perfectly. The only spell allowed: they could only append a reversed copy of the shortest possible prefix of the original message, ensuring the change was as minimal as possible. In Mirraville, even the act of completion honored the principle of efficiency.\n\nNow, each day, aspiring scribes arrived at the council chamber, each bringing a single scroll bearing a message. The council\u2019s task was always the same: for every scroll, determine the shortest way to complete its symmetry, according to the city\u2019s sacred rule. The challenge was to do so without altering the beginning, and by adding as little to the end as necessary\u2014a sign of both respect for the original words and for the city\u2019s tradition.\n\nThe council called this ritual \"Completion of Reflection.\" For every scroll brought to them, they would first check if it was already a \u201cmirrored text.\u201d If it was, the council would return it unchanged. If not, they would seek out the largest ending portion of the message that was already symmetrical, and, to honor the scribe\u2019s effort, would copy all that came before this mirrored ending, reverse it, and append it only once to the end\u2014thus forging the shortest possible palindrome beginning with the original scroll\u2019s message.\n\nThe rules were always conveyed thus: Each scribe must submit one scroll\u2014a single line of words or letters. The council would then reply with a single line: the completed, shortest palindrome beginning with the scribe\u2019s message. For example, when a scribe presented a blank scroll, the council returned it unchanged. If the message was \"cat\", the council would append \"ac\" to the end, forming \"catac\". For a scroll inscribed with \"cata\", the council would also append \"ac\", resulting in \"catac\". Thus, through this elegant ritual, the wisdom of Mirraville grew ever more beautiful in perfect symmetry.\n\nAnd so, through each day\u2019s ceremony, the library filled with messages that read the same, forwards and backwards\u2014a testament to the city\u2019s devotion to balance, beauty, and the subtle art of completion.",

        "question_content": "In the mystical village of Settonia, every year at the Festival of Ascension, the young apprentices compete to build grand piles of stones, each symbolizing their growth through the levels of magical mastery. The Elders decree that, at the start of the challenge, each apprentice receives a humble assignment: they must craft a pile consisting of a number of levels equal to a sacred number, which is passed to them at the dawn\u2014let us call this sacred count \u201cN.\u201d The success of the spellpile not only depends on the number of layers but on the precise number of stones woven into each one.\n\nThe rules, carved into the ancient codex, prescribe the ritual: the very base of the pile must contain exactly as many stones as the sacred count itself. For every level rising above, the apprentice must seek out the next magical number\u2014odd or even in eternal alternation, according to the parity of the sacred count. If N is odd, each subsequent level must be stacked with the next greater odd number than the one below, and if N is even, the quest is for the next even number each time. In this way, the pile grows in perfectly measured steps, never breaking the ritual\u2019s rhythm.\n\nThe true challenge lies not only in performing this ascending craft but in constructing the entire pile with unwavering precision, obeying the rules at every level from the base to the very pinnacle. The task set for the apprentices is thus: given the sacred count as a solitary input\u2014the number resounding through the air at the opening bell\u2014they must divine, and then report, the precise count of stones to place in each layer, from the bottommost to the highest, such that the codex\u2019s rules are followed without error. Their report takes the form of a sequence, a list marching upward through the levels, each inscribed with the number of stones it bears.\n\nThe council of Elders instructs the apprentices in the procedure for their mystical report. Each year, the test is presented thus: a scribe calls out the sacred count, and the apprentice must reply with a line recording the stones in each layer, listed in order, surrounded by brackets, numbers separated by commas. For example, if the sacred count is three, the apprentice must reply with \u201c[3, 5, 7]\u201d, for the first level holds three stones, then the next highest odd (five), then seven.\n\nLet us see how this unfolds: for a pile grown with the sacred count of three, the apprentice constructs three layers, beginning with three stones at the base, followed by the next odd numbers\u2014five and then seven for the next two levels. Their scroll, when read aloud, echoes as \u201c[3, 5, 7]\u201d, the perfect incantation for such a pile. Should the sacred count be four, the crafting begins with four stones, then rises in even steps\u2014six, eight, and ten\u2014leading to the answer \u201c[4, 6, 8, 10]\u201d.\n\nThrough the eyes of Settonia\u2019s youth, each coded test, input, and output becomes a tale of ritual creation: the input is the sacred count, quietly uttered as a whole number; the output is a list of each layer\u2019s stone tally, aligned to the festival\u2019s mystical laws. In this way, all rules and examples are encoded atop wisdom\u2019s parchment, guiding the apprentices\u2014and you\u2014toward mastery of the Festival\u2019s most storied challenge.",

The next number is then incremented by two in each subsequent level, always ensuring that the number of stones in each level follows the rules of the codex.

        "question_content": "In the Kingdom of Lexiconia, messages were sent across the land by way of Enchanted Paper Strips. These strips would often arrive from distant towns, covered with flowing phrases and punctuated pauses\u2014some marked by gentle spaces, others by the sharp tick of a comma. However, the townsfolk had grown weary of deciphering such muddled scripts, for they yearned to see each thought and word shine apart, unobscured and free, gathered in neat clusters for study or song.\n\nLexiconia's wise council thus established a clear decree: whenever a message\u2014no matter how grand or small\u2014arrived upon an Enchanted Paper Strip, it must be carefully divided. The guardians of language were instructed to split each phrase wherever a space wove its silence, or a comma cut its path. These fragments, called 'Word Jewels,' were to be collected in the order they were found, unblemished by stray gaps or the marks that once tethered them together.\n\nThe council soon recognized that travelers from afar would need a reliable way to perform this ritual. They decreed that anyone who wished to separate a script in this way must present the string of their message to the great Sorting Fountain, which would then issue, in response, an array where each element was one of the pristine Word Jewels, lined up in sequence. The Sorting Fountain would accept a single written passage as its input, and its output would be a collection of words\u2014each cleansed of spaces and commas, but otherwise untouched.\n\nTo aid petitioners, the council provided the following example incantations: when asked to divide the phrase \"Hi, my name is John,\" the Sorting Fountain would present the series: \u2018Hi\u2019, \u2018my\u2019, \u2018name\u2019, \u2018is\u2019, \u2018John\u2019. When challenged with the longer passage \"One, two, three, four, five, six,\" it would yield: \u2018One\u2019, \u2018two\u2019, \u2018three\u2019, \u2018four\u2019, \u2018five\u2019, \u2018six\u2019.\n\nThus, the council\u2019s guidance was clear\u2014when using the Sorting Fountain:  \n- The traveler must bring only the original message as their offering.  \n- The fountain would respond not with a rewritten passage, but with each word given its own place in a grand procession (an array), in the order first inscribed.  \n- In the official record, the input and output must be inscribed thus:  \n   - words_string(\"Hi, my name is John\") returns [\"Hi\", \"my\", \"name\", \"is\", \"John\"]  \n   - words_string(\"One, two, three, four, five, six\") returns [\"One\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\"]\n\nIn this way, peace and clarity were restored to Lexiconia\u2019s land, for every message could now be sorted into its true and shining parts\u2014no comma or pause left to obscure the meaning within. And so, with each story split and each word standing proud, the people of Lexiconia made communication an art both orderly and precise.",

        "question_content": "In the faded borderlands of Numeria, there was a long-standing custom among its people: whenever two travelers, let us call them the Seeker and the Gatekeeper, met at the crossing of their respective paths, they would establish a sacred range\u2014a stretch of territory defined by the farther point of the Seeker\u2019s journey and the nearer point of the Gatekeeper\u2019s watch. It was whispered that within that span, only numbers possessing a certain grace\u2014those that could be evenly split between two\u2014were ever to be selected for the ancient ceremonial dance called the Evenstride.\n\nNumeria\u2019s society held the Evenstride in high regard, for it represented harmony and balance. The Elders decreed a rule: when the Seeker and the Gatekeeper arrived with their chosen markers\u2014always positive and whole, and the interval from the Seeker to Gatekeeper inclusive\u2014a participant could be picked for the Evenstride only if it existed among them and carried the trait of evenness. More so, it had to be the largest such candidate possible, for the festival revered not just any harmony, but the fullest one the realm could offer.\n\nAs new seasons dawned, chroniclers were tasked with recording the greatest Evenstride candidate for every meeting of Seeker and Gatekeeper. If no worthy candidate appeared along their path\u2014meaning, if the territory contained no candidate that could elegantly split its own value without remainder\u2014the recorders would instead note a special mark called the Null Rune, signifying the absence of even balance for that union.\n\nTo ensure fairness and clarity, the records needed to be kept in a specific manner. The Seeker\u2019s and Gatekeeper\u2019s positions\u2014the starting and ending points of the territory\u2014would be noted as two whole positive numbers, the first no greater than the second. The result of the search, whether it was a valid participant or the Null Rune, would be logged alongside. This mirrored the ancient function: for each pairing of markers, decide if there existed a most harmonious candidate in that range, and, if so, record it; if not, mark the Null Rune. The chroniclers called the process \"choose_num,\" where they would write both the markers and the outcome.\n\nTake these moments from the record books as examples:  \n- When the Seeker chose marker twelve and the Gatekeeper fifteen, the largest compatible candidate within their shared territory was found to be fourteen, for it was not only within the range but also shimmered with perfect evenness. Thus, (\"12 15\" -> 14) was declared.\n- But on a day when the Seeker and the Gatekeeper marked thirteen and twelve respectively\u2014thus with no proper territory\u2014the Null Rune was inscribed, since no harmonious candidate could possibly join the Evenstride that day (\"13 12\" -> -1).\n\nAnd so, by observing this custom and faithfully recording each outcome\u2014whether an Evenstride candidate or a Null Rune\u2014the chronicles of Numeria preserved the pursuit of balance and wisdom for generations to come.",

The method takes two arguments `x` and `y`, which represent the starting and ending points of the territory respectively. The method checks if `x` and `y` are positive whole numbers, and if `x` is greater than `y`, it swaps the values of `x` and `y`. Then it starts from `y` and goes down to `x`, checking if each number is even. If it finds an even number, it returns that number. If it doesn't find any, it returns `-1`, indicating that a Null Rune should be inscribed.\n"

        "question_content": "In the distant land of Numeria, the Age of Binaries has dawned. Within this mystical realm, the High Mathemancers govern all through laws of reason and computation. Once each season, two sacred stones inscribed with positive numbers are drawn at random from the river\u2019s current. The ancient scrolls decree that these numbers, which we shall know as the First and Second Stones, serve as keys to unlock hidden truths.\n\nWhenever the ceremony begins, the Council of Calculation invokes the Law of Order: if the number on the First Stone is found to be larger than that of the Second, the magic of the computation fails, and a dark talisman with the mark \"-1\" is produced\u2014signaling fruitless effort and halting the ceremony. But when the stones bear numbers such that the First Stone's value is no greater than the Second, legend commands the Council to consider the whole sequence of stepping stones that begins with the First and ends with the Second. Every stone in between is included, for Numeria reveres completeness.\n\nThe sacred task is as follows: the Mathemancers must discover the average value of all these stepping stones\u2014including the first and the last. To honor the Precision Moon, this average must be carefully rounded to the nearest whole number\u2014neither falling short nor overreaching. This rounded value alone holds power, but tradition further demands that it be re-cast into the language of Binaries, the first script ever devised by Numeria's ancestors. The council ensures the answer is presented in this ancient form, beginning with the twin runes \"0b\", followed by only the sacred digits of that script. Only in this manner may the secret be revealed.\n\nFor visiting scholars who wish to seek Numeria\u2019s wisdom with their own numbers, the Council requests that the petition be written as two positive numbers separated by a space, representing the First and Second Stones. When the answer is found, it will be given back as either the mysterious \"-1\" (if no valid stones can be arranged) or as a string inscribed \"0b\" with the binary representation of the answer. In this ritual, every example is taught to apprentices: calling for stones marked one and five will yield \"0b11,\" for the sum and average of their steps is traced to three\u2014whose binary is \"0b11.\" Should the First Stone bear seven while the Second is five, the grim \"-1\" will appear, as this order is rejected by Numeria\u2019s laws.\n\nFurther tales record the test of stones ten through twenty: apprentices tally these, find their average, round as the moon commands, and write the answer in ancient digits as \"0b1111.\" Likewise, for stones with marks twenty through thirty-three, the old codes reveal the sacred answer\u2014\"0b11010.\"\n\nThus, all who enter Numeria\u2019s halls know the ritual: begin with two numbers, check that they stand in proper order, find every stone\u2019s number in between, average them, round to the nearest whole, and finally, transcribe that number into the ancient script. Through these rites, Numeria\u2019s wisdom shines anew, and the land\u2019s mysteries are preserved in both legend and logic for generations to come.",

The binary form of the rounded average is then returned, with \"0b\" as the prefix. The binary form is calculated using Python's built-in bin function, which converts an integer to a binary string. The [2:] slice is used to remove the \"0b\" prefix from the binary string.\n",

If it is, it returns \"-1\" as per the rules of the game. If not, it calculates the average of the two stones, rounds it to the nearest whole number, converts it to binary, and returns it with the \"0b\" prefix.\n"

        "question_content": "In the curious kingdom of Numeria, numbers are not just marks on parchment\u2014they are living beings, each with its own unique character. Among these digits, some are known for their even temperament: the gentler folk, who prefer their celebrations in pairs\u2014such as the twins 2, 4, 6, 8, and the even-keeled 0. The others, the odds, are more spirited, and those numbers composed solely of odd souls are prized by Numerian mystics for their unpredictably vibrant energy.\n\nEvery year, the Numerians host the Parade of Exclusives. To earn a spot, a number must present itself in full splendor, bearing only the feisty spirit of odd digits\u2014no even ones may be found within a contender\u2019s procession. Should a single even personality be hidden anywhere in a number's name, that number is kindly turned away for the year. Tradition also demands that only the proudest, most outstanding numbers\u2014those listed in increasing order\u2014march for all the city to see.\n\nThe royal council of Numeria, tasked with the Parade\u2019s lineup, receives a list of positive numbers each festival season. It is their sacred responsibility to examine each number\u2019s inner composition, sifting for even the tiniest trace of any even-hearted digit. Only when a number is proven to be untouched by any evens is it allowed to join the Parade. After their rigorous checks, the worthy participants must be gathered and arranged in ascending order\u2014Numeria\u2019s symbol of harmony and progress.\n\nCouncil scribes keep careful records of each festival\u2019s submissions and Parades. Each year, the council receives a list of numbers (the input), and after due process, posts a scroll with a list of all pure-odd participants, presented in order from smallest to largest (the output). Their process is described in the ancient code as so:  \n**Input:** A parchment listing several positive numbers, each eager to join the Parade.  \n**Output:** A sorted list\u2014always in increasing order\u2014gathering all numbers comprised exclusively of odd digits, with no exceptions. If no numbers are worthy, the parade lineup is simply empty.\n\nFor clarity, the council preserves examples in the festival chronicles. For example, when the parchment reads [15, 33, 1422, 1], the judges inspect each: \"15\" dances with a single 1 and a vibrant 5 (both odd), \"33\" is fashioned from twin 3s, and \"1\" is as pure as can be\u2014these three are invited. \"1422,\" however, has both a 4 and two 2s, and is disqualified. All worthy numbers are gathered and arranged as [1, 15, 33] before the parade begins. In another year, the parchment [152, 323, 1422, 10] is presented. Yet, every number has at least one even-spirited companion lurking; as a result, that year\u2019s Parade is a somber, empty spectacle\u2014no numbers walk the avenue, and the scroll reads only [].\n\nThus, the great Parade of Exclusives continues year after year, celebrating Numeria\u2019s oddest, most exuberant numbers, welcomed only if they bear no trace of even disposition, and always presented in order for all to admire. The council\u2019s task endures: to diligently sift each list of aspirants, preparing the roster for the city\u2019s cheers\u2014or, as sometimes happens, for a quiet, entirely empty parade.",

For each number, it converts it to a string to easily access its digits. It then iterates over each digit in the number, checking if it is even. If it finds an even digit, it sets a flag and breaks the loop. If it does not find any even digits, it adds the number to a list of odd numbers. Finally, it returns the list of odd numbers sorted in ascending order.\n",

        "question_content": "In the dawn-lit realm of Numeria, digits were not just numbers, but living sprites, each with their own unique aura and lore. Each year, the Council of Counting summoned the sprites representing the sacred digits between the first and ninth\u2014One through Nine\u2014to partake in the Ceremony of Names. Only the sprites that truly belonged within this revered range were permitted entry; wanderers or imposters bearing odd forms\u2014such as those shrouded by negative mists or carrying double-digit cloaks\u2014were politely turned away at the gates, their stories left to wait for another day.\n\nThe tradition was strict: prior to the ceremony, the eligible sprites would gather in a great line within the marble Hall of Sorting, where ancient magic ensured that younger, lesser sprites stood first, and their elders vied for position behind them. Once the order had been set\u2014each sprite knowing its place by the truth of its digit\u2014they\u2019d perform a grand spiral dance, rotating the queue so that the eldest took the lead, marching their way to the front. This was the revered Reversal, signifying that wisdom, too, has its turn in the sun.\n\nBut a ceremonial rite remained: throughout the proceedings, the sprites were not called by their ordinary ciphers, but by the ancient lyrical names endowed upon them at Numeria\u2019s birth. Thus, a sprite who bore the mark of the number eight would be hailed as \"Eight,\" while one with a single flame would be praised as \"One,\" and so forth. This naming bestowed honor, and in the final retelling, ensured their legacy would live on in song and tale.\n\nThe council\u2019s chronicler\u2014following age-old scribal traditions\u2014collected the sprites\u2019 arrival list in a scroll. The process began by presenting a record (an array of integers) representing those who appeared at the ceremony\u2019s threshold. Only those numbers between the first and ninth glyphs, inclusive, were beckoned forward; the rest quietly faded back into the shadows of Numeria. If, on a rare year, not a single sprite came forth, the roll-call returned nothing but the silence of an empty hall.\n\nShould anyone seek to capture this tale for the ages, they would be instructed: first, write down the guild of sprites who arrived, then filter out the mysterious or misplaced, letting only the true One through Nine reside. Sort these chosen as the ancient rites dictate, then spin them \u2018round so that the order is reversed, before at last transmuting each into its honored spoken name. The chronicler\u2019s return should be a list of these names, in the mystic order achieved.\n\nTo illustrate, in one memorable ceremony, the record rolled forth as [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]. Through the spell of selection, only the proper sprites survived, standing as [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8]. The dance reversed their order, and their ancient names echoed through the chamber as [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"]. On the rare dawns when no sprite appeared, as with an empty list, only the hush of potential was returned: []. And on those odd occasions\u2014such as when the arrivals were [1, -1, 55]\u2014the gatekeeper admitted only the rightful \"One,\" returning her name alone: ['One'].\n\nThus does Numeria keep its traditions alive, transmuting lists of ordinary digits into epic roll-calls, ready for any chronicler who seeks to follow the ceremonial rites\u2014be they coder or bard\u2014and ensure every sacred sprite stands tall in the story of numbers.",

        "question_content": "In the realm of Numeralis, the Council of Sages devised a most peculiar trial to test the apprentices seeking entrance into the Order of Calculation. Legends whispered that those who journeyed far enough in their studies would one day face the \u201cLadder of Numbers,\u201d a mystical staircase that demanded a demonstration of both factorial fortitude and the summoning of sequential totals. Each step on this ladder was marked not only by its position, but by the unique challenge it presented\u2014especially to minds tasked with deciphering its ever-shifting logic.\n\nHere, the Ladder stood tall with a count of steps known as N, a number selected by the Sage of Input at the start of each trial. For each step, apprentices began with the very first rung, climbing one step at a time, always keeping careful note of the position they stood upon. It was a widely respected norm in Numeralis society that each step\u2019s number (starting with the first and counting upwards) shaped its challenge: those who stood upon a step with an even number were required to conjure a deep magic\u2014calculating the factorial for that precise position, meaning they needed to multiply all whole numbers from one up to their current step. The odd steps, in contrast, posed a challenge less arduous but equally important, summoning the very sum of all numbers from one to their perch.\n\nThe Order\u2019s test called for a precise record: each apprentice, when invoking the fabled Ladder, was presented with a single parchment scroll (input), unrolled to reveal the number of steps N they must ascend\u2014nothing more, nothing less. Their task was to return to the Council not with tired limbs, but bearing a list as long as the count of steps, where the number resting at each place was earned according to the step\u2019s magic, be it factorial or sum. This scroll, the output, recorded the feat of calculation with the value for the first step, followed by the second, and so on, up to the Nth step, with no steps omitted or repeated.\n\nThough apprentices marveled at the logic that governed the Ladder of Numbers, they all understood: success depended not simply on completing the climb, but in ensuring every number was both precisely and efficiently conjured. It was not enough to finish the ladder\u2014they had to submit their record with utmost fidelity to the rules the Council decreed, using only information concerning the step they stood upon and the total number assigned. The Ladder did not tolerate shortcuts, and only the most vigilant could claim to have fulfilled the trial as completely as possible for any chosen number N, within the boundaries set by the Sage of Input.\n\nWhen they retold their trials in the Hall of Examples, a scribe would declare, \u201cGiven the calling of the ladder with a step count of five, an apprentice\u2019s scroll must list these numbers: first, one, for the triumph at the first step; next, two, the sum of one and two; next, six, the result of multiplying one, two, and three; next, twenty-four, the product up to four; finally, fifteen, which is the sum of all whole numbers up to five. Thus, when the Ladder was called as f(5), the scroll returned read [1, 2, 6, 24, 15].\u201d \n\nAnd so, the tradition continued for each new apprentice: given any number N as input, the logic of Numeralis required the creation of a list of just that length\u2014each number within sealed either by the magic of factorials for even settings, or linearly summoned sums for odd, from the bottom step to the very top. Those who mastered this trial carved their names into the annals of the Order, forever known as Arithmeticians of the Ladder.",

The `factorial` method calculates the factorial of a given number, and the `sum_up_to_n` method calculates the sum of all numbers up to a given number.\n\nThe `f` method iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and for each step, it checks if the step number is even. If it is, it calculates the factorial of the step number and adds it to the result list. If the step number is odd, it calculates the sum of all numbers up to the step number and adds it to the result list.\n\nThe `factorial` method uses a recursive approach to calculate the factorial of a number. If the number is 0, it returns 1 (since the factorial of 0 is 1). Otherwise, it returns the number multiplied by the factorial of the number minus 1.\n\nThe `sum_up_to_n` method uses the built-in `sum` function and `range` function to calculate the sum of all numbers up to a given number.\n",

        "question_content": "In the magical domain of Numeria, enchantments are woven into the fabric of every integer. Among these mystical numbers, there exist special beings known as palindromic figures\u2014numbers whose essence remains unchanged when read forwards or backwards, much as ancient prophecies that hold their meaning in any tongue. These figures are cherished by Numeria\u2019s sages, who hold yearly festivals to count and celebrate their wondrous qualities.\n\nAccording to the long-standing customs of Numeria, every palindromic figure, should it be a part of the sacred sequence that starts with the Root One and stretches all the way to a specified Summit chosen by the Council of Scribes (any whole number between the Root One and not exceeding the Great Barrier, which is one thousand), must be classified according to its even or odd nature\u2014a distinction made by the High Diviners who study the flow of magic within the numeral itself. An even palindromic figure resonates with stability and balance, while an odd palindromic figure pulses with energy and motion.\n\nThe day of the Grand Enumeration arrives when a seeker presents the Council with a Summit\u2014declaring the range of whole numbers, beginning from the Root One and culminating at their chosen Summit. The Council\u2019s eternal task is to recount all palindromic figures within this range and determine exactly how many exhibit the serene stillness of evenness, and how many burn with the fervor of oddness. The Council, precise in their rituals, will respond solemnly with an answer in the form of a twin-stone: first displaying the number of even palindromic figures uncovered, followed by the number of odd ones.\n\nFor example, when a seeker places the Summit at Three before the Council, the journey begins at the Root One and ends at Three. The palindromic figures thus found are the Root One, the Twin Two, and Brave Three. Upon examination, only the Twin Two radiates the even frequency, while the Root One and Brave Three both shine with the odd aura. The response, inscribed upon the twin-stone, is (1, 2), meaning one even and two odd palindromic figures have been found.\n\nOn another day, should a seeker dare to set the Summit at Twelve, the Council counts their palindromic treasures: the figures from the Root One through the Steadfast Nine, joined by the Mirrored Eleven. Among these, the Twin Two, the Steadfast Four, the Silent Six, and the Prosperous Eight all emit the even resonance, numbering four in all. The others\u2014five in number\u2014along with the Mirrored Eleven, make up six odd palindromic figures. The Council\u2019s reply then, carefully presented, is (4, 6).\n\nWhen conducting such rituals, the seeker must bring forth a single number, the Summit itself, as their plea to the Council. In return, they receive a twin-stone\u2014two numbers, the first for even palindromic figures; the second, for odd\u2014each inscribed with indelible magic. Through examples such as these, the enchanted laws of Numeria remain ever clear, guiding the hands of seekers and scribes alike to celebrate the wondrous balance of symmetry, parity, and mystery in their land.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling land of Numaria, the wise elders once gathered to solve a puzzle of spiritual resonance. In their enchanted villages, every family kept secret scrolls containing sequences of sacred numbers\u2014some were gentle and positive, while others bore the mark of negativity, starting with an ominous shadow. These numbers were not simply for counting livestock or recording moon cycles, but for determining who among them possessed a \"vital spark.\"\n\nThe elders, following ancient tradition, evaluated these scrolls with a ritual: for each number, they summoned forth each digit, one by one. If a number bore a dark beginning (that is, if it was negative), the very first digit carried the curse, and its value was considered negative in the sum of all digits. The remaining digits\u2014those that followed\u2014were always treated with the purity of positivity, regardless of the number\u2019s origins. Through this special calculation, the sum of the number\u2019s digits was revealed, sometimes ending in gloom (zero or below), and sometimes in life-affirming light (greater than zero).\n\nThe challenge laid before the youth of Numaria was simple, yet critical to the villagers\u2019 annual renewal festival: given a scroll of any length (perhaps even empty), count how many numbers on that scroll would awaken with a \"vital spark,\" that is, with a total digit-sum shining bright above the line of nothingness. Importantly, only those whose sum surpassed the abyss of zero were to be counted, ensuring only truly spirited numbers were included in the tally. The elders declared, with stern faces, that if the scroll contained no numbers at all, the outcome was to be read as zero, with no further ceremony.\n\nThe task was formalized as such: wise apprentices were to engrave their findings in a specific way. Given a scroll (an array of whole numbers), they would invoke their ritual by calling upon the function with the scroll as input\u2014*count_nums(scroll)*\u2014and report the number of vital sparks (those with digit-sums greater than nothing) as a single number. For example: an empty scroll would yield a count of zero; a scroll holding the numbers (negative one, eleven, and negative eleven) would provoke careful calculation: the sum for negative one is negative one, for eleven is two, and for negative eleven is negative one plus one, or zero. Thus, only one number, eleven, awakens the spark. Another scroll, imbued simply with one, one, and two, would gleam forth with three numbers, each passing the trial.\n\nThese customs ensured that every year, the scrolls provided only the most lively energies on which the festival thrived. To apprentice, the rule was clear: sort through each number using the ritual logic, count each that possesses the vital spark, and report back the tally\u2014no more, no less. The village prospered, and their tradition of numeric discernment inspired awe for generations to come.\n\nTo illuminate their method, the elders offered these examples:\n- Given an empty scroll ([]), the outcome was zero\u2014there were simply no numbers to evaluate.\n- For the scroll holding negative one, eleven, and negative eleven ([-1, 11, -11]), careful digit-summation revealed only one worthy number (since -1 gives -1, 11 gives 2, and -11 gives -1+1 = 0).\n- When handed a scroll of three vibrant numbers ([1, 1, 2]), each digit-sum shone above zero, resulting in a tally of three vital sparks.\nThus, young and old alike learned to wield the ritual, and Numaria\u2019s days sparkled with clarity and purpose.",

For each number, it first checks if it is negative. If it is, it converts the number to positive and then calculates the sum of its digits, treating the first digit as negative. If the number is not negative, it simply calculates the sum of its digits. If the total sum is greater than 0, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.\n",

For each number, it converts it to a string and iterates over each digit. If the number is negative, it subtracts the digit from a running total. If the number is positive, it adds the digit to the running total. After processing all digits, it checks if the running total is greater than 0. If it is, it increments a count.

If the number is negative, we convert it to a string and iterate over each digit (excluding the negative sign). If the number is positive, we convert it to a string and iterate over each digit.

        "question_content": "In the ancient Kingdom of Ordina, the people held an annual ceremony known as the Parade of the Silver Spheres. Each noble house in the land would send a prized silver sphere marked with a unique insignia, and these spheres would be arranged upon the grand Array Path\u2014a line of mysterious floating plinths. On the day of reckoning, the spheres would be placed in an order not of the houses' choosing, but at the whim of fate, their sequence unpredictable and uncontrollable.\n\nIt was an unbreakable tradition that the honor of \u201cMost Harmonious House\u201d could be awarded only if the spheres, by some series of magical moves, could be arranged so that each insignia grew no smaller than the one before it as you walked the Array Path from start to finish. The ancient spell, known as the Right-Hand Gale, allowed the entire array of spheres to be shifted: with each casting, every sphere slid one plinth to the right, and the last sphere circled to rest at the very first plinth. The wizards of Ordina decreed that this wind could blow as many times as needed\u2014so long as all the spheres remained uniquely marked\u2014and the nobles could use any number of such gale-turns in pursuit of harmony. \n\nYet there were strict limits: the Parade could feature any number of spheres, from not a single one to gatherings counted in the tens of thousands\u2014though none could bear the same house\u2019s insignia. If, in the rare case, the Parade Path was empty of all spheres, the kingdom would declare victory by default, for emptiness is, themselves believed, the purest symmetry. In all other cases, the challenge remained: by shifting the order as many times as desired using the Right-Hand Gale, could the spheres ever be arranged to ascend in honor from least to greatest, without ever decreasing?\n\nYour task as Master Arbiter is to determine for any given arrangement whether harmony is attainable by these means. The input to your Oracle\u2019s tablet shall be a list of the spheres' insignia, laid out as numbers in their current order. The Kingdom expects your Oracle to answer either \u201cTrue\u201d (meaning harmony is possible through the allowed shifting) or \u201cFalse\u201d (if no sequence of wind-turns can achieve the noble goal). The Oracle always interprets an empty list as immediately harmonious, returning \u201cTrue.\u201d For example, if the input list is `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`, two right-hand winds can send the smaller insignias to the front, resulting in perfect non-decreasing order\u2014so the Oracle would answer \u201cTrue.\u201d For another input such as `[3, 5, 4, 1, 2]`, no number of shifts would ever yield the required order, and so the Oracle\u2019s stern judgment would be \u201cFalse.\u201d\n\nTo report your results, the Oracle requires you to feed in the arrangement as a list of integers, and will return one word: \u201cTrue\u201d or \u201cFalse,\u201d corresponding to whether the Parade can reach a harmonious sequence. The input format is thus a list such as `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`, and the output is a single True or False. For each arrangement provided, it is your solemn duty to report back the possibility of reaching the harmonious order, using the rules of the Right-Hand Gale as your guide.\n\nIn closing, let us revisit the fates of two ancient parades: For the set `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`, the Master Arbiter announced \u201cTrue,\u201d having observed that with two wind-turns, the parade fell smoothly into ascending honor. However, for the unfortunate gathering `[3, 5, 4, 1, 2]`, the wizards wrung their hands, unable to conjure harmony, earning a verdict of \u201cFalse.\u201d And so, as the silver spheres gleam across the Array Path, it is by your wisdom and swift calculation that Order or Discord is revealed in Ordina\u2019s grand Parade.",

If it finds such a pair, it means that the array can be sorted by shifting the elements to the right, which is the definition of \"harmony\" in the problem. If it doesn't find such a pair after checking all possible splits, it returns False, meaning that the array cannot be sorted by shifting elements to the right.\n",

If any element is not equal to its index plus one, it means that the array is not in ascending order and the function returns False. If the function iterates over the entire array without finding any elements that are not equal to their indices plus one, it returns True, indicating that the array is in ascending order.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because in the worst case scenario, the function needs to iterate over all elements of the array once. The space complexity is O(1), as no additional space is used that scales with the size of the input.\n",

This method takes a list `arr` as input. If the list is empty, the method returns `True`, because an empty list is already in ascending order. If the list is not empty, the method iterates over the list and checks if each element is greater than the previous one. If it finds an element that is not greater, the method returns `False`, because this means the list is not in ascending order.

Each scroll bears a sequence of mystical glyphs, where only the glyphs of Light and Shadow\u2014represented by the radiant \"one\" and the silent \"zero\"\u2014may be inscribed. These scrolls, always of equal length, are said to hold the secrets to unlocking new knowledge when properly combined.\n\nThe scribes of Bitlandia abide by a ceremonial rule when interpreting scrolls together: for every mark upon the scrolls, if the same glyph appears at the same position on both scrolls (either both Light or both Shadow), the union at that position must remain in complete darkness\u2014a \"zero.\" Yet, should the glyphs contrast at that spot (one scroll shows Light, the other Shadow), the result at that position shall become radiant\u2014a \"one.\" This process, known as the Ritual of XOR, must be performed for each glyph position, from the first to the last.\n\nThe council\u2019s challenge is thus: given two scrolls of equal length, each composed only of these binary glyphs, decipher the resulting scroll by performing the Ritual of XOR as described, constructing a new scroll with glyphs that reflect the mystical union. The goal is to interpret every glyph position according to the ritual\u2019s rule and assemble the complete resultant scroll, as efficiently and accurately as possible.\n\nThe Council of Binary Scribes expects all petitioners to present their input scrolls in a specific manner. First, both scrolls are recited on a single line, separated by a space. The council then awaits the single line that contains the glyph sequence of the resulting scroll after the ritual has been performed. This both ensures clarity and preserves the ancient order.\n\nFor instance, a junior scribe once brought forth two scrolls, each bearing three glyphs: one inscribed \"zero, one, zero,\" and the other \"one, one, zero.\" After applying the Ritual of XOR at each glyph position, the resulting scroll shone with \"one, zero, zero.\" Thus, the input presented to the council would be:  \n`010 110`  \nAnd the expected output, the new scroll, would be:  \n`100`\n\nIn this way, the wisdom of Bitlandia is preserved, and the scribes continue to unveil the secrets hidden within the mystical patterns of Light and Shadow.",

        "question_content": "In the mystical archipelago of Numeria, two neighboring islands\u2014Evenora and Oddalia\u2014were famed for their unique traditions. Each year, representatives from both islands carried their sacred stones, marked with the power of numbers, to the Festival of Exchange. Evenora revered balance and serenity, inscribing only even-valued stones as a symbol of harmony. Oddalia, on the other hand, prided itself on unpredictability, embracing both even and odd stones with equal gusto.\n\nAt the heart of the festival lay a peculiar custom: the leaders of Evenora and Oddalia would gather all their stones into two distinct collections. Tradition dictated that stones could be exchanged freely between the islands, with no restriction on the number of stones swapped. However, there was one unbending rule from Evenora\u2019s Council\u2014their final pile must consist solely of even-valued stones, no matter the cost or the scale of the exchange.\n\nYour task, as Numeria\u2019s chief mediator, is to judge whether such a glorious transformation is possible. Presented with the inscriptions on the stones from both Evenora and Oddalia\u2014each collection handed to you as a list of numbers\u2014you must decide if an exchange exists that will leave every single stone in Evenora\u2019s possession bearing an even number.\n\nTo express your decision, you must craft a message. Should it be possible to make all of Evenora\u2019s stones even through exchanges of any number of stones between the two islands, the decree must simply state: \u201cYES\u201d. If, however, some odd-marked stone is doomed to remain on Evenora, then you must reply with \u201cNO\u201d. These judgments are to be offered for every set of collections brought forth, using the precise input and output format as follows: you will be given two lists of numbers (Evenora\u2019s and Oddalia\u2019s, in that order), and must return \u201cYES\u201d or \u201cNO\u201d accordingly.\n\nFor example, suppose the heads of state bring you collections listed as `[1, 2, 3, 4]` for Evenora and `[1, 2, 3, 4]` for Oddalia. After some shuffling and swapping, it is found that all of Evenora\u2019s stones can be made even, prompting you to deliver the answer, \u201cYES\u201d. Alternatively, if the stones read `[1, 2, 3, 4]` for Evenora and `[1, 5, 3, 4]` for Oddalia, the available exchanges cannot accomplish Evenora\u2019s dream, and you respond with \u201cNO\u201d.\n\nThus, you weigh the collections, and your proclamations maintain the festival\u2019s harmony. Every time collections are presented, you must analyze and judge: input arrives as two lists of numbers\u2014Evenora\u2019s and Oddalia\u2019s stones\u2014and your output is simply either \u201cYES\u201d or \u201cNO\u201d, determined by the possibility of creating an all-even Evenora through unrestricted exchanges.",

        "question_content": "Long ago, in the ancient city of Glyphoria, the Keepers of Letters managed the grand Hall of Whispers\u2014a wondrous vault in which letters traveled as tokens of memory and intent. Every day, rows upon rows of tiny parchment slips, each marked by a single, lowercase glyph, would arrive and be scattered across the marble tables. These slips were always arranged in long, winding trails, separated by spaces, resembling serpentine riddles awaiting unraveling under the golden lanterns of the Hall.\n\nThe Keepers held a singular responsibility: to quietly observe these parades of glyph-marked slips and to seek out those letters that appeared the greatest number of times within any one message. It was their tradition, born of logic and order, to create a tally for each kind of glyph. Whenever the marble tables were cleared and a new set of slips was laid, the Keepers would count how many times each unique glyph had nestled itself among the others. Should two or more glyphs achieve the highest tally, all would be honored equally and recorded with pride.\n\nThe most ancient law of the Hall dictated that a Keeper must firstly decipher the procession by separating each glyph from its companions, using spaces as the mark of distinction. Then, a record needed to be inscribed, not just chronicling any one glyph, but listing all those that stood shoulder-to-shoulder with equal and highest frequency, along with the precise count of their appearances. But should a silent procession arrive\u2014if no glyphs were presented, and only emptiness lay on the marble\u2014no record would be made that day.\n\nThose who sought wisdom from the Hall would approach with a single line\u2014a chain of space-separated, lowercase-lettered slips\u2014and expect, in return, a royal decree in the form of a collection or ledger. Each honored glyph would stand as a keeper in this ledger, paired with the number of its appearances: a perfect mirroring of fairness. This sacred list would be handed back as a *dictionary*\u2014an unadorned but powerful Keeper\u2019s record. If ever an empty parchment was brought, a blank record, symbolized by a barren ledger, would be returned.\n\nFor instance, when a procession of \"a b c\" was examined, each glyph strode forth exactly once, and thus the record showed 'a': 1, 'b': 1, and 'c': 1. In the case where \"a b b a\" marched through the Hall, it was seen that both 'a' and 'b' shared the highest honor, each appearing twice, so the Keeper\u2019s ledger read 'a': 2 and 'b': 2. When the slips read \"b b b b a,\" only 'b' strode four times in the procession, and the ledger honored it alone with 'b': 4. For a solitary, silent day\u2014with no glyphs at all\u2014the ledger returned was an empty page.\n\nThus, a seeker to the Hall of Whispers would present their procession, as a string containing letters separated by spaces, and expect a Keeper's record to be returned as a dictionary. For example:  \n- Request: \"a b c\" yields {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}  \n- Request: \"a b b a\" yields {'a': 2, 'b': 2}  \n- Request: \"a b c a b\" yields {'a': 2, 'b': 2}  \n- Request: \"b b b b a\" yields {'b': 4}  \n- Request: \"\" yields {}.  \nThrough these practices, the Keepers ensured that the most prominent whispers were never lost, and fairness reigned even among the humblest glyphs of Glyphoria.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Lexiconia, there was an old custom among its citizens known as *The Purity Test of Words*. Here, whispers told of a magical script inscribed upon scrolls (these were simply called phrases) and a special list of forbidden glyphs, handed down by the council of Keepers. Upon the coming-of-age of each scroll, the Keeper would bring forth the forbidden glyphs and, with a gentle hand, erase every mark within the scroll that matched any symbol from this dreaded list.\n\nThe laws of Lexiconia were precise: first, the scroll\u2014call it the Song of Letters\u2014must be presented alongside the Sheet of Exclusions, the council\u2019s latest record of forbidden glyphs. The Keeper would then perform the ritual: every occurrence of a marked glyph from the Exclusion Sheet would be purged entirely from the Song of Letters, as though it had never existed. No stone could go unturned, and the purification must be thorough\u2014every letter in the scroll scrutinized for a match.\n\nBut the ritual was not done at the cleansing alone. Afterward, the Keeper would gaze upon the newly purified phrase and conduct a test both ancient and profound\u2014the Reflection of Symmetry. This required the Keeper to examine whether the phrase, when read from the first letter to the last and from the last to the first, appeared identical in every detail. If so, the phrase was to be crowned a \u2018Perfect Mirror\u2019. If not, it received no fanfare, but the preservation of order was celebrated nonetheless.\n\nThe council always required that every time this ceremony was conducted, the Keeper announce the results formally, in pairs: first, the remaining purified phrase as the Keeper now read it, and second, a proclamation\u2014*True* if it possessed the Perfect Mirror quality, or *False* if, heartbreakingly, it did not. These pairs were always recorded as (resulting phrase, True/False), a tradition mirrored down the generations, never altered for any reason, no matter the phrase or exclusion.\n\nLet the tales of those who sought wisdom from this rite pass on as example: When young Lyra came with the scroll \u201cabcde\u201d and the forbidden glyphs \u201cae,\u201d her purified phrase became \u201cbcd,\u201d and symmetry escaped it\u2014thus the conclusion was (\u2018bcd\u2019, False). Another, Marcus, offered \u201cabcdef\u201d and the forbidden glyph \u201cb\u201d; once cleansed, the phrase became \u201cacdef,\u201d and again, it lacked perfect reflection\u2014so the council wrote (\u2018acdef\u2019, False). Yet once, when old Eldrin brought forth the storied \u201cabcdedcba\u201d and eliminated \u201cab,\u201d the phrase that remained, \u201ccdedc,\u201d astounded the council with perfect symmetry\u2014a judgement of (\u2018cdedc\u2019, True).\n\nAnd thus, the saga continues\u2014each ceremony a test of purity and harmony, where every phrase and forbidden list, once presented, must yield a record of its fate: the remaining phrase, and the truth of its reflection, inscribed for all to see.",

If they are not equal, it means the `song` is not a perfect mirror, and the method returns a tuple containing the `song` and `False`.\n\nThis solution assumes that the `song` and `exclusion` are strings, and that the `exclusion` string contains only characters that are to be removed from the `song`. The `song` string may contain any characters, including those that are not forbidden.\n"

        "question_content": "Once upon a time, in the whimsical realm of Numeria, the Archivists of Curiosity gathered daily to peruse scrolls sent from every corner of the world. Each scroll was peculiar in that it contained nothing but a sequence of runes, yet every rune was a digit from one to nine or the ciphered symbol for zero. These scrolls, while seemingly simple, were said to hold the secret to determining the \u201cOddness Quotient\u201d of Numeria\u2014a magical property highly prized among the folk, for it governed curiosities, mishaps, and delightful oddities.\n\nThe people of Numeria followed a tradition tied to an ancient charm: for each scroll brought before them, they would tally up those numeric runes that were not evenly divisible by the mystical number two. These runes\u2014one, three, five, seven, and nine\u2014were known as \u201csingular echoes\u201d among the Numerians, representing all things odd and unpredictable in the world. Each scroll could be of any length, and there could be as many scrolls as one dared bring. But the Archivists\u2019 challenge was always the same: for every scroll, they must declare, in issued proclamation, exactly how many singular echoes it contained, using Numeria\u2019s peculiar turn of phrase.\n\nWhen the scholars received a new batch of scrolls, they would prepare a sequence of reports, each repeating the following sentiment but with a twist: wherever the cryptic \u201ci\u201d appeared in their traditional phrase, it must be replaced with the actual count of singular echoes\u2014both in the phrase and in any related term, such as \u201cstr1ng\u201d or \u201c1nput.\u201d Thus, a statement about, say, a scroll holding exactly four singular echoes might read, \u201cthe number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput.\u201d Each declaration was thus a personalized incantation, harmonizing with the mystery of the runes themselves.\n\nThe Archivists\u2019 method was simple: given a stack (which outsiders might call a list) of scrolls (strings of digits), **they would announce a sequence of statements matching the number of scrolls presented. For the k-th scroll, they would declare**:  \n_\"the number of odd elements Xn the strXng X of the Xnput.\u201d_  \n**Here, X is to be replaced with the number of singular echoes (odd digits) in that particular scroll.**\n\nConsider, for instance, that a wanderer brought a single scroll baring the digits \u201c1234567.\u201d The Archivists, after a moment\u2019s counting, noted that among these digits, one, three, five, and seven sparkled with the oddness aura. Four in all! Thus, their proclamation was:  \n\u201cthe number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput.\u201d\n\nOn another day, someone delivered two scrolls: the first with \u201c3,\u201d the second with \u201c11111111.\u201d The first was quickly recognized to contain a single singular echo, and the second, eight, for each rune was a one. The Archivists declared:  \n\u201cthe number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.\u201d  \nand  \n\u201cthe number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput.\u201d\n\nThus, whenever a visitor arrived bearing a collection of digit-filled scrolls, the Archivists would respond with an **orderly stack of proclamations**\u2014one for each scroll\u2014crafted as above. In Numeria, this tradition is held as both a curious entertainment and a powerful means of recognizing the oddness threaded through the land\u2019s everyday mysteries.",

        "question_content": "In the distant highlands of Numeria, there lies the ancient Guild of Sums, a secretive order whose members are tasked with mastering the deep magic within mystical ledgers. Each ledger is a scroll inscribed with a sequence of enchanted numbers\u2014the numeric spirits known as 'nums.' These spirits are neither always benevolent nor malevolent, but their collective energies\u2014when grouped\u2014hold immense power.\n\nThe Guild initiates each apprentice by presenting them with a single ledger, where entries may weave together blessings and curses (that is, positive and negative numbers). The lore within Numeria states that a true master can divine the weakest current among these numbers: to find, among all runes read together in succession and without skipping, the gathering which burdens the soul with the lowest possible sum\u2014a challenge akin to finding the gloomiest shadow in a gathering storm.\n\nTo pass their trial, apprentices must uncover not just any poor combination, but the poorest: the lowest tally that can be summoned by taking at least one consecutive stretch of spirits from the ledger. There are whispers of ledgers with a single entry, and legends tell of scrolls heavy with thousands of spirits\u2014yet the rule demands that even among vast numbers, the same unwavering search is followed. The apprentice must be prepared: the entries can number as high as ten raised to the fifth power, and each invoked sum shall be drawn from any uninterrupted passage of spirits, however brief or long\u2014so long as it holds at least one.\n\nTo demonstrate mastery, the Guild requires all initiates to provide their answer in the ancient format: first, the input ledger must be inscribed as a bracketed procession, such as `[2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]`. Then, the summoning must yield a single integer\u2014an unmistakable declaration of the lowest sum conjurable from within the ledger. Thus, the input and output follow the form:  \n`minSubArraySum(nums)`  \nwhere `nums` is the presented sequence and the answer is an integer, imparted on the wind for all Guild scribes to record.\n\nFor example, when apprentice Fiona is given `[2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]`, she recognizes the faintest darkness lies with the solitary spirit, '1'\u2014so she answers `1`. Meanwhile, when a young wizard faces the daunting scroll `[-1, -2, -3]`, he bravely binds all three sorrowful spirits, revealing the lowest sum, `-6`. Each apprentice knows: to become a true master, they must always find the dreariest whisper within any scroll, and must do so as efficiently and accurately as the Guild\u2019s magic demands.\n\nThus, the trials and teachings of Numeria endure: every scroll of magical numbers brings a new challenge, but the rule remains\u2014seek the smallest sum that a consecutive gathering of spirits can conjure, and declare it with certainty. But heed this well: your answer must always bring forth the most potent gloom the ledger holds, lest the Guild\u2019s trust fade like mist at sunrise.",

        "question_content": "Long ago, in the verdant valley of Aquatara, there stood an orderly field of wells\u2014each one representing a separate family\u2019s promise for a bountiful season. Rows of wells were set out in neat columns upon the fertile earth; every shimmer in the dark water below a testament to both fortune and effort. Within each well, droplets of water lay waiting, some hidden, some sparkling in the morning light, while stretches of empty stone marked where water once was or had yet to seep in. The villagers marked the presence of water with bright pebbles, so a pebble in a well\u2019s row meant a single unit of precious water ready for the taking.\n\nThe Council of Aquatara, known for their precise regulations and unity, decreed that every family would be given a bucket of a specific, unyielding size\u2014no more, no less. All buckets in the land would carry the same, fixed capacity, known to the families as the \u2018limit of a single draw.\u2019 Each time a bucket was lowered into a well, it could scoop up at most this many units of water, regardless of how much water shimmered enticingly below. Thus, emptying a family's well became a matter of patience and planning\u2014a test of careful counting and efficient drawing.\n\nIt was tradition, then, for a gatherer to stand above their well at the start of each moon cycle, viewing the colored pebbles and calculating: for every well, how many times must I lower and raise my sturdy bucket to retrieve its water completely, given the bucket\u2019s limit? They understood that, in practice, if a well was shallow or drought-stricken\u2014holding no water at all\u2014no effort was required and the bucket could remain beside the well unused.\n\nThe challenge for every Aquataran was to determine, for the entire field of wells, the fewest number of bucket-lowering actions required to render every well completely dry\u2014all pebbles gone, nothing left behind. Each draw, whether it brought up many units or just a lone droplet, counted as a single descent. The gatherers strove always for efficiency, for extra draws cost time and strength that could be spent on other communal labors. Their goal was steadfast: minimize the total number of bucket descents across all wells.\n\nIt was customary to recount the tales of clever gatherers through examples. On one occasion, three wells held pebbles arranged as: [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]. With a bucket that held but one unit, the gatherers learned they must lower buckets a total of six times to clear all the water. On another occasion, the pebbles were arranged as [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], and with sturdier buckets holding two units, only five draws sufficed. Yet, sometimes, in years of drought and empty stones, as in [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]] with a bucket able to hold five, not a single draw was needed at all.\n\nThus, in Aquatara, given a field of wells\u2014each well marking its water with pebbles, and each villager equipped with a bucket of specified capacity\u2014everyone prized the art of calculating the minimal number of bucket descents needed to collect all the water. For each new arrangement of wells and bucket size, a gatherer would write down the pebbles\u2019 pattern and the bucket\u2019s capacity, and after careful thought, announce the number of draws\u2014the output of their village\u2019s ancient wisdom.",

If the element is 1, it means there is water in the well and we increment the count by 1. After we have counted all the wells, we calculate the total number of bucket descents needed by dividing the count by the capacity.

If the cell contains water (represented by 1), it starts a loop to empty the well by lowering the bucket and removing the water from the grid. The number of draws is incremented each time the bucket is lowered. The bucket is lowered by setting the corresponding cells in the grid to 0 and in the buckets matrix to 1. The solution assumes that the grid is a 2D list where 1 represents water and 0 represents dry land. The capacity parameter is the maximum number of cells that the bucket can carry at once.

Then, it iterates over each column in the grid, and for each column, it simulates the process of lowering and raising the bucket until all wells are empty. The number of bucket descents is counted and returned as the result.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n*m*c), where n is the number of rows in the grid, m is the number of columns in the grid, and c is the capacity of the bucket. This is because for each column, we may need to raise the bucket multiple times until all wells are empty. The space complexity is O(n*m), as we need to store the state of each well in the `buckets` array.\n",

The `max_fill` function then iterates over each column in the grid, and for each column, it iterates over each row from top to bottom. If the bucket in the current cell is not full, it lowers the bucket into the well and adds the amount of water from the well to the bucket. The function keeps track of the number of bucket descents by incrementing a counter. The function returns the total number of bucket descents.\n",

It first initializes a 2D array `buckets` to keep track of how much water each well has. Then, it iterates over the grid to calculate the number of drops needed for each well and the total number of drops. After that, it enters a loop where it tries to move water from a well to its neighbors until no more water can be moved. The loop continues until no more water can be moved, which means all wells are empty. Finally, it returns the total number of drops.\n",

If the cell contains water (represented by 1), it calculates the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered and raised to empty the well. This is done by dividing the current bucket's capacity by the capacity of the bucket. The result is then rounded up to the nearest whole number, as you can't have a fraction of a bucket. This number is then multiplied by the bucket's capacity to get the total number of drops required for the well. This value is added to the total number of drops. The process is repeated for all cells in the grid. The function finally returns the total number of drops required to empty all wells.\n",

For each row, it iterates over each element in the row. If the element is 1, it means there is water in the well and we need to lower the bucket.

Then, for each bucket, it iterates over each well in the grid. If the bucket is not full and there are still pebbles in the well, it adds a move and fills the bucket. The solution assumes that the grid represents the number of pebbles in each well, and that the bucket can hold up to `capacity` pebbles. The function returns the total number of moves needed to fill all the wells.\n"

        "question_content": "In the distant realm of Numeria, the Council of Celestial Scribes keeps a vast register of magical stones. Each stone is inscribed with an ancient numeral\u2014a non-negative integer from the language of the Old Code. It is said that these stones possess hidden auras, and that the sages can perceive their true nature by reading the binary flame that flickers within each stone: only the wisest know how many times the sacred fire of \u201cone\u201d dances within these binary flames.\n\nThe scribes have developed a unique tradition to organize their stones, guided by cosmic harmony. They insist that when an array of stones is to be arranged, the ordering follows the intricate choreography of the binary fire. Specifically, a collection of stones must be lined up such that those with the least number of glowing \u201cones\u201d in their inner binary flame stand first. If two or more stones exhibit identical numbers of \u201cones,\u201d then, in accordance with the Law of Secondary Harmony, the stones must be arranged among themselves according to their face value\u2014their inscription\u2014ascending from least to greatest.\n\nThe challenge for any apprentice scribe is clear: given a precise list of stones, one must reorder them so that the Council\u2019s tradition is fully realized. The apprentice is provided a scroll depicting the initial lineup (as a list of non-negative numerals), and is expected to transmute this into the newly harmonized sequence. When the scribe invokes this rite, the input is always a collection of numbers, and the output must be a reordered sequence matching Numeria\u2019s law of binary and numeric harmony.\n\nFor example, when a batch of stones inscribed with the numbers one, five, two, three, and four arrives at the Hall, the Council expects the apprentice to process them into the order: one, two, three, four, five. This is because \u201cone\u201d in binary has a single spark, \u201ctwo\u201d and \u201cfour\u201d each have the same count, but their face values differ, and so on. As another case, if the stones bear negative inscriptions\u2014such as negative two, negative three, negative four, negative five, and negative six\u2014the apprentice should still respect the law, even if their binary flames tell a cold and different tale. Likewise, if presented with zero, one, two, three, and four, the output must strictly follow the ceremonial order, starting from the stoneless aura of zero.\n\nIn the tradition's records, both the input and the expected arrangement are always shown as two arrays\u2014one before, and one after the ceremony, both written in the language of numerals in brackets, such as `[1, 5, 2, 3, 4]` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The Council expects the same format for both input and output, to ensure that future apprentices may review and study the process.\n\nHere are the ceremonial examples, recast through Numeria\u2019s lens: The stones `[1, 5, 2, 3, 4]` must be reordered to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`; the sequence `[-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]` transforms to `[-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]`; and `[1, 0, 2, 3, 4]` becomes `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. Through this discipline, Numeria\u2019s harmony of numbers and their hidden flames is forever maintained.",

            "```python\nclass Solution:\n    def sort_array(self, arr):\n        # The key function for sorting is to count the number of ones in the binary representation of the number\n        # If the counts are the same, then the numbers are sorted by their value\n        arr.sort(key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))\n        return arr\n```\n\nThis Python solution uses the built-in `sort` function of Python lists. The `key` parameter of the `sort` function is a function that takes an element of the list and returns a value that will be used for sorting purposes. In this case, the `key` function is a lambda function that returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the count of ones in the binary representation of the number, and the second element of the tuple is the number itself. The `sort` function uses these values to sort the list.\n\nThe `bin` function is used to convert the number to its binary representation as a string. The `count` method of the string is used to count the number of ones in the binary representation. The `lambda` keyword is used to define a small anonymous function.\n\nThe `sort` function is a method of the list class in Python. It modifies the list it is called on. The `sort` method does not return a new list, but it returns `None`. This is why the `sort` method is called on `arr` and the result is returned.\n",

This event, beloved by poets and linguists alike, took place in the grand Hall of Strings, where tapestries wove together tales from every spoken word whispered beneath the sun. The quest was simple in its premise but meticulous in its demand, as it called the citizens to test their attention to the intricacies of language and the hidden power of consonants.\n\nTradition in Lexiconia decreed that any tale, chant, or phrase presented for the Quest must be carefully examined not for its meaning, but for the arrangement of its words. Every phrase would be cleaved apart, each word weighed for the number of strong, unobtrusive letters\u2014the consonants, those guardians that shape the flow of speech while yielding to the brightness of the vowels. The judges would silently count, their fingers tapping once for every consonant: the bold b, the quick c, all the way through to the zealous z, ignoring the gentle vowels a, e, i, o, and u that drifted like clouds through the words.\n\nThe rules were exacting: from any tale unfurled in the Hall, choose only those words that house precisely as many consonants as the master requested that day. If, say, the number three was spoken, then only those words where three consonants could be found\u2014no more, no less\u2014would earn applause and safe passage to the next round. Any phrase devoid of words entirely would bring silence, for there would be nothing to judge.\n\nThe task, presented to all who attempted the Quest, was thus: \u201cGiven a string of words and a number signifying the sought count of consonants, return each word that possesses exactly that number of guarding consonants, and reveal them in the order they had been spoken. Should the string contain no words at all, respond with an empty collection. Remember, only letters and spaces are honored in the Call; symbols, numbers, and other marks are unable to pass through the Hall\u2019s gates.\u201d\n\nAs guidance, the elders of Lexiconia spoke the following tales as examples, each demonstrating the ritual in full clarity:  \n\u2003\u2013 When the phrase \u201cMary had a little lamb\u201d was spoken with a call for four consonants, the word \u201clittle\u201d alone emerged, honored by the Quest ([\u201clittle\u201d]).  \n\u2003\u2013 For those seeking three consonants in the same phrase, both \u201cMary\u201d and \u201clamb\u201d stepped forward ([\u201cMary\u201d, \u201clamb\u201d]).  \n\u2003\u2013 The request for two consonants from \u201csimple white space\u201d left the Hall silent\u2014no word met the charge, and so an empty collection was declared ([ ]).  \n\u2003\u2013 When \u201cHello world\u201d was judged for four consonants, \u201cworld\u201d was the sole champion ([\u201cworld\u201d]).  \n\u2003\u2013 In \u201cUncle sam,\u201d the call for three led only \u201cUncle\u201d to the light ([\u201cUncle\u201d]).\n\nThus, every participant in the Consonantal Quest would present their string\u2014called s\u2014and their chosen number\u2014known as n\u2014to the masters, who would respond with the list of words that met the strict consonant count, in precisely the order they appeared. In Lexiconia, such discipline ensured language was honored by both detail and devotion, and so the legacy of the Quest would continue, word by consonantal word.",

        "question_content": "In the fabled city of Letrathia, words were not mere elements of speech; they held the keys to secret pathways and hidden treasures. In this world, vowels and consonants belonged to rival guilds, forever intertwined in a dance across the scrolls of the Grand Lexicon. The tradition of the Distant Whisper dictated that only those who could decipher the \u201chidden vowel\u201d\u2014one snuggled between two consonants and yet closest to the Far Gate (the right end of the word)\u2014could unlock certain cryptic doors.\n\nAmong the ancient laws etched in the Book of Seals, there were strict customs regarding which vowels could serve as a Whisper. Firstly, only the vowels that found themselves flanked on either side by stoic consonants could be considered. These chosen vowels must not occupy the sacred positions at either the very start or very end of a word, as the elders believed that guardians at the borders could never serve as true intermediaries. Furthermore, for a vowel to participate in the ritual, not only must it be couched between consonants, but the search for this vowel must commence from the rightmost end, for only the closest to the Far Gate was honored in the Distant Whisper rite.\n\nTo determine the champion vowel, the town\u2019s Scribes would receive an incantation, written as a simple word\u2014a string of English letters, where cases (like \u201cA\u201d and \u201ca\u201d) carried distinct magical energies. The objective was to scan, beginning from the Far Gate (that is, from the final letter on the right), and seek the first instance of a vowel securely nestled between two consonants. Should it transpire that the word bore no such vowel\u2014whether because its vowels all stood isolated, or any fitting candidates were placed at the beginning or end of the procession\u2014the Scribes would declare their search fruitless and respond with an empty parchment: a blank signifying no appropriate Distant Whisper could be raised.\n\nThe Scribes would announce their ritual as follows: when presented with a single word (the input), their task was to return, in a delicate script, the first qualified vowel they unearthed from their scan, scrutinizing from rightmost to left. If they found none, their response was but an empty sigil, denoted as a vacant string. For those wishing to witness examples of this custom, the Scribes might demonstrate: invoking the rite upon \u201cyogurt\u201d would result in \u201cu,\u201d as it is the nearest secret-holding vowel ensconced between consonants from the end. Presenting the word \u201cFULL,\u201d the outcome would be \u201cU,\u201d as tradition and case remain vital. In the case of \u201cquick,\u201d no such vowel fits the strictures, so the Scribes return an empty string. For \u201cab,\u201d with no vowel ever cradled between consonants, the response is likewise void.\n\nTo formalize their chronicles, the Scribes would express their responses as such:\n\n**Input:**  \nA single word of English letters.\n\n**Output:**  \nEither a single character\u2014the vowel discovered between two consonants (as per the ritual)\u2014or, if unmet, a blank string.\n\n**Examples:**  \nWhen the incantation is \u201cyogurt,\u201d the answer is \u201cu.\u201d  \nFor \u201cFULL,\u201d the result is \u201cU.\u201d  \nWith the utterance \u201cquick,\u201d the Scribes respond with \"\" (empty string).  \nAnd for \u201cab,\u201d the reply is also \"\" (empty string).\n\nThus, in the halls of Letrathia\u2019s Grand Lexicon, every scribe and seeker knew the laws of the Distant Whisper\u2014ensuring that only through the closest, consonant-framed vowel might a word\u2019s silent power be set free.",

        "question_content": "In the distant city of Parensia, every citizen communicates by exchanging intricate ribbons, each adorned only with two colors: emerald loops and sapphire knots. The emerald loop is drawn as a curve to the right\u2014much like an opening parenthesis\u2014while a sapphire knot twists back to the left, emulating a closing parenthesis. The Elders of Parensia decree that when citizens greet each other, they must join their ribbons together, and the result must be seamless: each emerald loop paired and embraced by a matching sapphire knot. Only then is the greeting considered harmonious by the town's ancient customs.\n\nOne fateful day, two envoys come to the Elders with their own ribbons\u2014each consisting only of these loops and knots, though the arrangement might differ. The ceremonial task is that the envoys must connect their two ribbons, one after the other in any order they choose, so that the final tapestry tells a perfectly balanced story; not a single emerald loop may be left unmatched, nor may any sapphire knot ever attempt to close a story that was not begun first. The tapestry is only \"good\" when, reading from start to finish, the story never falters\u2014never does the closing outpace the opening, and in the end all tales are sealed perfectly.\n\nThus, the Elders set the challenge, formalized as follows: Given a list containing exactly two sequences of woven ribbon\u2014each written as a string using only the symbols of emerald loops and sapphire knots\u2014the envoys must decide if there is *any* order in which they can tie these two sequences to produce a harmonious ribbon. In simpler terms: Is it possible that, by choosing which goes first and which goes second, the joint ribbon is balanced from start to finish\u2014without ever having an unmatched knot, and with no lingering loops unfulfilled at the end?\n\nYour own role, honored scribe, is to prepare an oracle known as `match_parens`, which shall accept a list bearing two such ribbons as strings. The function must then return 'Yes' if the envoys can find even one arrangement to create a harmonious storytelling ribbon, and 'No' if there is no such hope. \n\nThe output must directly state this verdict using the words 'Yes' or 'No', corresponding exactly to whether a harmonious ribbon is possible. When presenting your decision, always use the following format:\n\n```\nmatch_parens([ribbon_one, ribbon_two]) == 'Yes'  # if possible\nmatch_parens([ribbon_one, ribbon_two]) == 'No'   # otherwise\n```\n\nConsider, for example, these trials from recent Parensian history:\n- When the two ribbons are `'()('` and `')'`, the envoys can place the first ribbon before the second, yielding the solemn sequence `'()( )'`, a perfectly balanced tale. In this case, the scribe must record:  \n  `match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'`\n- If instead, the ribbon pair is comprised of `')'` and `')'`, then no arrangement can ever render a harmonious story\u2014each knot seeks to close an opening that was never made. For such a case, the scribe must solemnly write:  \n  `match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'`\n\nIn this way, by weaving together both the logic and the ceremony of the Parensian greeting, every envoy\u2019s arrival is judged justly; harmony prevails only when every loop finds its knot, and every knot closes a loop.",

If an open bracket is encountered, the counter is incremented. If a closed bracket is encountered, the counter is decremented. If the counter ever goes negative, this means there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns 'No'. After checking both strings, if there are any unmatched brackets, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.\n",

            "```python\nclass Solution:\n    def match_parens(self, lst):\n        # Initialize counters for open and close brackets\n        open_count = close_count = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over the first string in the list\n        for char in lst[0]:\n            if char == '(':\n                open_count += 1\n            else:\n                close_count += 1\n        \n        # Iterate over the second string in the list\n        for char in lst[1]:\n            if char == '(':\n                open_count += 1\n            else:\n                close_count += 1\n        \n        # If the number of open brackets is equal to the number of close brackets,\n        # then it's possible to create a balanced string\n        if open_count == close_count:\n            return 'Yes'\n        else:\n            return 'No'\n```\n\nThis solution works by iterating over each character in the two strings. If the character is an open bracket, it increments the open_count. If the character is a close bracket, it increments the close_count. After iterating over all characters, if the open_count is equal to the close_count, it means that the strings can be balanced, so the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.\n",
            "```python\nclass Solution:\n    def match_parens(self, lst):\n        stack = []\n        for ribbon in lst:\n            for char in ribbon:\n                if char == '(':\n                    stack.append(char)\n                elif char == ')' and len(stack) > 0 and stack[-1] == '(':\n                    stack.pop()\n                else:\n                    return 'No'\n        return 'Yes' if not stack else 'No'\n```\n\nThis solution uses a stack to keep track of the opening parentheses. It iterates over each character in the input strings, pushing an opening parenthesis onto the stack and popping it off when a closing parenthesis is encountered. If a closing parenthesis is encountered without a corresponding opening parenthesis on the stack, or if there are any unmatched opening parentheses left on the stack at the end, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.\n",

It first checks if the list contains exactly two strings. Then it checks if the strings contain only '(' and ')' characters. After that, it checks if the number of '(' and ')' characters in both strings are equal. Finally, it checks if the first string ends with ')' and the second string starts with '('. If all these conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes', otherwise it returns 'No'.\n"

        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Luminara, the citizens cherished stories above all else. Each year, during the Festival of Tales, storytellers would gather in the grand plaza, each bringing with them a scroll inscribed with their most cherished tale. The city had a peculiar tradition: while everyone could present their story, only one scroll would be chosen to be read aloud beneath the silver lanterns\u2014the scroll that held the longest tale. If, by chance, several stories were equally lengthy, the first storyteller to arrive would be honored, and their story would fill the night air. Yet, should no storytellers appear, the plaza would remain silent, the lanterns dimmed in fair acknowledgment of an empty stage.\n\nFor this festival, the rules were clear and set by the city\u2019s elders. A council scribe would receive a parade of scrolls, each inscribed with a tale of varying length\u2014some might be as brief as a whisper, others winding on for many lines. The order in which scrolls were handed to the scribe was strictly observed, a nod to the city\u2019s respect for tradition and punctuality. If the scribe received no scrolls at all, the council would note the absence, and no tale would be chosen. \n\nThe scribe\u2019s solemn task was to examine the collection of scrolls and determine which held the lengthiest tale. If multiple scrolls contained stories of identical length, the very first such scroll\u2014delivered before the others\u2014would be selected as the winner. The community understood that the festival valued not only the grandeur of a story but also the swiftness with which a storyteller declared their intent.\n\nTo participate in this tradition, each storyteller would write their name and story upon a scroll and line up in their chosen order. The scribe would receive the full list of scrolls, one after another. If the line was empty, the scribe would quietly announce that no story could be chosen. Otherwise, the scribe would select the single, longest tale, favoring the earliest arrival in the event of a tie. The outcome\u2014either the honored scroll\u2019s tale or a declaration of silence\u2014would then be proclaimed to the awaiting crowd.\n\nFor clarity, the city\u2019s council described this process as follows:  \n- At the start of the festival, the scribe is handed a series of scrolls, each bearing a tale (the input).  \n- If there are no scrolls, the outcome is silence (no tale is read aloud).  \n- If every scroll holds a tale of the same length, the scribe reads the first one.  \n- If some scrolls are longer than others, the scribe selects the very longest, and in case of a tie, honors the earliest arrival.\n\nConsider the following festival mornings:  \n- On a morning when no storyteller arrives (the list is empty), the plaza remains quiet\u2014no story is chosen.  \n- When three stories of equal brevity are offered\u2014say, \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"\u2014the first tale, \"a\", is read, in keeping with tradition.  \n- If the scrolls presented were \"a\", \"bb\", and \"ccc\", the third scroll, \"ccc\", would be chosen, as its story is the longest of the day.\n\nAnd so, the Festival of Tales in Luminara continues, upholding tradition with clarity and respect for both length and order, ensuring the city\u2019s greatest stories are always heard\u2014and heard in the fairest way possible.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeria, where numbers are cherished like rare gems, there exists a grand tradition among its citizens. Each year, the council of Numeria challenges its finest mathematicians\u2014known as the Enumerators\u2014with a unique quest: from a sprawling ledger of numbers recorded through the year, they must seek out the most extraordinary values. This ledger is a magical parchment, home to an array whose length is always at least one and never exceeds a thousand entries, with each entry ranging from the icy depths of minus a thousand to the blazing height of a thousand.\n\nThe council's rules are strict yet simple, rooted in Numeria\u2019s logic. Every season, the council announces a special number known as the \u201cCrown Count.\u201d This number, always positive and never greater than the total entries in the magical ledger, dictates exactly how many of the most potent numbers the Enumerators must retrieve. These chosen numbers will be celebrated and displayed in order, from the least to the greatest, so every citizen can marvel at their magnificence and see every step in the ladder of greatness.\n\nThe Enumerators' sacred task is this: from the magical ledger, they must select precisely as many of the greatest numbers as the Crown Count decrees. If there are numbers of equal value contending for a spot, every instance must be counted\u2014such is the law of fairness in Numeria. Once chosen, these numbers should be arrayed in ascending order, demonstrating both their selection and their progression.\n\nTo communicate their findings to the council\u2019s Scribe, the Enumerators are instructed to present their results following the traditional script: the Scribe first receives the full magical ledger and the value of the Crown Count. The response must be a list of the selected numbers, meticulously sorted from smallest to largest, as the council expects no less than full transparency and order.\n\nLet us peer into three notable chronicles from Numeria's archives, where future Enumerators can learn the art. Once, the ledger held the enchanted sequence of negative three, negative four, and five, with the Crown Count set at three\u2014so the heroes returned the trio of numbers: negative four, negative three, and five. Another year, the register recited four, negative four, and another four, with two seekers declared; both highest numbers, each a four, were marked and returned. In a further tale, from the list of negative three, two, one, two, negative one, negative two, and one, the Crown Count of one meant only the greatest single value\u2014two\u2014was chosen as Numeria\u2019s champion.\n\nThus, in the great city, to master the Enumerators\u2019 challenge is to distill, from any sequence of magical numbers and a given Crown Count, the most illustrious values\u2014arranged so all citizens might trace their rise to eminence. This logic serves as the backbone of Numeria\u2019s progress, and its full rules\u2014the ledger\u2019s size and range, the protocol for equal numbers, and the ritual of sorted presentation\u2014are all woven into the city\u2019s tradition, guiding Enumerators on their annual quest.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling Moonstone City, numbers weren\u2019t just tools\u2014they had lives, personalities, and unique social customs. Every year, the Grand Parade of Integers threaded through the cobblestone avenues, with each number striding in a grand line, proudly taking its assigned spot by the city elders. In this parade, every spot along the line was counted from the beginning, starting with the very first. Tradition held that even though the parade-goers all looked quite similar to the uninitiated, the real magic happened based on both a number\u2019s position in the line and its own odd or even spirit.\n\nWithin Moonstone society, odd-natured numbers were seen as curious and unpredictable, while even-spirited ones embodied order and harmony. But\u2014unbeknownst to outsiders\u2014a special honor was reserved each year for those eccentric odd-integer citizens who stood in **even-numbered positions** (counting the first spot as the initial position in the line). The Grand Mathemagician tasked a chosen scribe with tallying a secret sum: only the values of those odd friends standing on the second, fourth, sixth, and so on.\n\nYour challenge, as the Parade Scribe, is straightforward\u2014but requires precision. You are handed a parchment containing the full list of the parade\u2019s order, a non-empty congregation of integer denizens, one after another. Your task is to record the total influence\u2014the sum\u2014of all the odd numbers who have taken up residence in the evenly-numbered positions of the lineup.\n\nBut tread carefully! The city\u2019s customs set clear limits for you. Every year, the list always includes at least one participant, and all numbers on the list are proper Moonstone citizens\u2014always whole numbers, never empty spots, nor foreign symbols. To fulfill your sacred role, you\u2019ll write a function called `solution` that receives the city\u2019s current parade lineup, a list of numbers in the order of their appearance. You\u2019ll then return a single integer: the grand sum of the odd-numbered citizens in even positions, or zero if none march there.\n\nLet\u2019s view how the parade traditions play out. Imagine the list `[5, 8, 7, 1]`: spot one holds five, spot two hosts eight, spot three is filled by seven, and spot four by one. Here, seven (at position three) and one (at position four) are both odd, but only the position-four marcher stands on an even spot\u2014so we add just one, as well as five on spot one paired with none (since it\u2019s not even-indexed in this custom). However, by parade logic, the sum is twelve, for both seven and five are counted. In `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, every marcher is odd, but only those at positions two and four are counted, giving a total of nine. On the other hand, if the parade order is `[30, 13, 24, 321]`, neither thirteen nor three twenty-one are on the right spots for this honor, so the sum is zero.\n\nThus, as the Parade Scribe, you must look past the surface, heed these traditions, and deliver the honored sum as clearly as Moonstone\u2019s morning bells. The list comes in, the sum goes out\u2014your chronicle of Moonstone\u2019s quirkiest and most exceptional marchers.",

Each spring, guild members would bring an assortment of rare treasures to the ceremonial table, placing them in a line one after another\u2014never less than a single trinket, and never more than one hundred, for tradition dictated these boundaries most strictly.\n\nAs the first rays of dawn lit the hall, the guild\u2019s master announced this year\u2019s challenge. \u201cFrom the very start of this array of marvels,\u201d he declared, \u201cselect a particular number of items\u2014your choice may be any count, so long as you take no fewer than one and no more than the total array laid out before you.\u201d This chosen number was revered as the Key, a sacred integer known in Numeria\u2019s code as K.\n\nBut the rules of collection were as old as the guild itself: among the items taken from the head of the array, only those whose values could be described with just one or two marks upon the Numerian counting scroll (that is, any artifact with a worth less than a hundred, be it a single or double-digit fortune) could be gathered for the tally. The larger treasures, with three or more symbols, though tempting, were strictly forbidden from the calculation of this year\u2019s sum.\n\nThus, the master enjoined the guild: within the sacred limit of the first K treasures, gather all you may whose measure bears but two signs or fewer, then sum their values together. The goal was to maximize this gathered sum within the stated margin, swiftly and efficiently according to the old logic of Numerian accounting.\n\nFor the scribes, recording each ritual\u2019s result was paramount. The process would always begin with two entries: first, the orderly line of treasures\u2014written as an array of numbers\u2014and, second, the Key, the count of treasures to inspect from the start. The scribes would then inscribe the final sum gathered from those items which met the festal condition. In Numerian terms, one might see:\n\n    Input: arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], k = 4  \n    Output: 24\n\nHere, the tally derives from the sum of twenty-one and three, the only two treasures among the first four with worths within the prescribed two-mark range. So, the Collectors\u2019 task each spring was ever the same: from the head of the procession, pluck out and sum all the marvels that counted as \u201csmall wonders,\u201d according to the rules penned by their founders.",

        "question_content": "In the mystical kingdom of Arithmia, there existed a peculiar ancient game known as the Chain of Destiny, beloved and whispered about by mathematician-monks and puzzle-mages alike. The game began with a single noble number\u2014known by the monks simply as the \"Spark.\" From that Spark, a magical journey would unfold, with each subsequent step strictly dictated by the Laws of Parity: when the current number in the sequence was a creature of even form, it would shrink to half its size. If, instead, it was odd and proud, it would be transformed into an even more formidable presence\u2014tripled and increased by one.\n\nLegend had it that, regardless of the initial Spark, the sequence always journeyed down the winding road until it eventually returned to the singularity\u2014an audience with the ancient monarch, One. The Chain of Destiny thus endlessly fascinated the thinkers of Arithmia, who believed the rules must follow unbreakable logic. It was the pride of the kingdom that, no matter where a Spark began, the journey always ended back at the throne of One.\n\nThe learned council, seeking records for future generations, set forth a decree: for any chosen Spark, a scribe must record only the moments of oddness during its journey through the Chain\u2014those times when the journeyer wore the garments of an odd number, whether at the outset or upon transformation. Furthermore, tradition dictated these moments must be presented to the council in perfect ascending order, as testimony to the elegance underlying the kingdom\u2019s mystical patterns.\n\nWhen a scribe approached the Council Hall with a Spark in hand, the process of using the Chain began like this: The Spark would be set upon the path, and its every transfiguration faithfully observed, following the rules of shrinking or tripling-plus-one depending on whether it stood as an even or odd number after each metamorphosis. Along the way, every occasion that the Spark\u2019s power level was odd would be noted and quietly collected, until the Spark finally mellowed at the throne of One. The scribe\u2019s rigorous training ensured that only these moments\u2014marked by oddness\u2014were kept. At the end, the scribe would carefully arrange their notes in order, lowest to highest, before depositing them in the great archives.\n\nTo clarify their methodology, the scribe was required to follow a scroll format: the Spark\u2019s number would be fed as a single positive integer, and the scribe\u2019s list of odd moments would be returned as a roster of integers, sorted in order. For instance, should a scribe begin with a Spark of five, the moments would unfold as: first five, then sixteen, then eight, four, two, and finally one. Only five and one among these would wear the mantle of oddness. Thus, upon being asked for a record, the scribe would declare:  \nInput: 5  \nOutput: [1, 5]  \n\nSo it became clear to all in Arithmia: every Spark\u2014be it a humble one or a mighty giant\u2014must have its journey through the Chain told in this way, so that the story of oddness and the inexorable path to One might never be forgotten.",

The Collatz Conjecture is a mathematical conjecture named after Lothar Collatz, who first proposed it in 1937. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\nThe program starts with a given number `n` and generates the sequence by applying the following rules:\n\n- If the current number is even, divide it by 2.\n- If the current number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.\n\nThe program also checks if each number in the sequence is odd. If it is, the program adds it to a list. Finally, the program returns the list of odd numbers in the sequence.\n"

        "question_content": "In the ancient kingdom of Calendaria, timekeeping was a sacred art known only to the Archivists of the Grand Clocktower. Each Archivist was tasked with deciphering scrolls inscribed with dates, for these dates determined when the sun festivals began, when taxes were due, and even when the Gates of Fortune would open. But the scribes of Calendaria were a forgetful bunch, and errors would slip into their scrolls. Thus, a Grand Rule was established: every date submitted to the Council must pass the Test of Validity, ensuring the seamless rhythm of the kingdom\u2019s calendar.\n\nThe Grand Rule had many parts. First, no scroll could be submitted blank; every inscribed slate needed etched numbers. Second, each was to follow a sacred pattern\u2014the Month first, followed by the Day, and finally the Year, separated by the mystical dashes inscribed by the Clocktower\u2019s scribe (\u201cmm-dd-yyyy\u201d). Using any other mark, like a slash or a dot, was strictly forbidden, as it confused the time-spirits. Third, the Kingdom was divided into twelve Houses, one for each moon-month; no date could reference an unknown month, neither lower than the first nor higher than the twelfth. Days within each House, too, were strictly regulated. Most Houses\u2014those of Sprouts, Blossoms, Harvest, and so on\u2014harbored no more than thirty or thirty-one days, while the House of Dewdrops, known elsewhere as the second month, thrived on twenty-nine days at its fullest.\n\nThe Council demanded that all Archivists master the Test of Validity, which they practiced as an incantation called \"valid_date.\" This incantation required a single strip of parchment inked with a date string; its magic would whisper \u201cTrue\u201d if the parchment bore a valid date, and \u201cFalse\u201d if not, ensuring the Clocktower\u2019s archives stayed pure. All submissions were meticulously checked, with no empty slates, no misformed dates, and every day and month falling within the bounds decreed by the moon and sun.\n\nTo train young students in this sacred duty, the senior Archivist demonstrated with lessons: Should a parchment be marked with \"03-11-2000,\" the incantation would thunder \u201cTrue\u201d! But \"15-01-2012,\" where the month claimed to be beyond the twelfth House, would be rejected with a resounding \u201cFalse.\u201d Likewise, \"04-0-2040\" would fail the ritual, for there is no zeroth day; but \"06-04-2020,\" gliding along the proper format and day, would be accepted warmly as \u201cTrue.\u201d If a scribe accidentally used slashes, as in \"06/04/2020,\" the magic would not recognize it, and \u201cFalse\u201d would be returned.\n\nThus, the lesson for all was clear: in Calendaria, the Test of Validity was not only a matter of tradition but also a safeguard against chaos. Whenever called upon, the magic of \"valid_date\" would illuminate the path, ensuring only honored dates would enter the kingdom\u2019s chronicles. The archivists would reflect on the sample scrolls, understanding why \"03-11-2000\" and \"06-04-2020\" were permitted, while \"15-01-2012,\" \"04-0-2040,\" and \"06/04/2020\" were banished\u2014thus preserving the order and harmony demanded by both the Council and the cosmos.",

It then checks if these parts can be converted to integers. If not, it returns `False`.\n\nNext, it checks if `month` is between 1 and 12 (inclusive). If not, it returns `False`.\n\nThen, it checks if `day` is between 1 and 31 (inclusive). If not, it returns `False`.\n\nNext, it checks if `month` is one of the four months with 30 days and if `day` is greater than 30. If so, it returns `False`.\n\nNext, it checks if `month` is February and if `day` is greater than 29 (unless the year is a leap year). If so, it returns `False`.\n\nFinally, it checks if `day` is greater than 31. If so, it returns `False`.\n\nIf all these checks pass, it returns `True`, indicating that `date` is a valid date.\n",

        "question_content": "In the winding alleys of Lexiconia\u2014a city where language itself gives shape to reality\u2014there is an ancient guild known as the Order of Dividers. Their duty is to unlock the meaning hidden in every utterance that passes through their gates, for the city is governed by rituals of segmentation and parsing: only by the rules of the Order may a phrase be properly interpreted.\n\nThe guild follows intricate customs to determine how each message must be deciphered. First, they approach each inscription by seeking spaces\u2014those tangible gaps that, once found, clearly separate words within the scrolls and parchments. When a phrase has such open divides, the guild declares each segmented piece its own 'word,' and records them together, preserving their original order.\n\nHowever, not every text comes bearing spaces. Some messages are tightly wound, with words pressed together by the presence of commas alone. In those cases, the Order applies a special blade, sharpening their focus on the commas to delicately split the phrase, thus forming an array of units, just as they would with spaces. Each resulting segment stands as its own word in the ledger.\n\nBut on rare and particularly mysterious occasions, a message arrives with neither space nor comma to guide the guild. When this occurs, a more esoteric Leonian tradition takes place. The guild\u2019s scribes quietly count a particular subset of the lower-case runes: those whose standing in the alphabet is an odd number (imagine that the first letter of the rune, 'a,' is declared naught, the second, 'b,' is one, and so forth to 'z', which is twenty-five). For each such rune whose position is odd, a tally is made. The total becomes the single value representing the unbreakable message, for no division was granted by the text\u2019s form.\n\nMembers of the Order are known for their meticulous logging. Each spell or message they receive is presented as a string\u2014one uninterrupted enchantment\u2014and their task is always to return either a list of words as divided by spaces or commas, or, if such unbreakable strings arrive, the count of lower-case runes with odd placements. The ledger is presented in a specific format: a list of words (when split) or a single number, always matching the examples provided by the senior scribe. If a phrase reads \u201cHello world!\u201d the response is a list: [\u201cHello\u201d, \u201cworld!\u201d]. If it reads \u201cHello,world!\u201d the delimiter changes, but the result parallels the first. When faced with the truly indivisible \u201cabcdef\u201d, the tally method applies, and the response becomes the number three.\n\nThus, the Order stands vigilant, parsing every utterance that passes their threshold. Their ledgers read as follows:\n\n- Faced with \u201cHello world!\u201d, the text contains spaces, so they return the words as: [\u201cHello\u201d, \u201cworld!\u201d].\n- Presented \u201cHello,world!\u201d, since there is no space but a comma is found, they return: [\u201cHello\u201d, \u201cworld!\u201d].\n- Upon receiving \u201cabcdef\u201d, devoid of any divide, they note that the runes at positions one (\u2018b\u2019), three (\u2018d\u2019), and five (\u2018f\u2019) are odd, resulting in a tally of three.\n\nAnd so Lexiconia thrives, its meaning ever preserved by the Order\u2019s careful logic and unwavering dedication to the rules of segmentation.",

The count is returned as a single integer.\n\nThe ASCII value of a character can be obtained using the `ord` function. The ASCII value of 'a' is 97, 'b' is 98, and so on. Therefore, the ASCII value of a character minus the ASCII value of 'a' gives the position of the character in the alphabet (with 'a' being at position 1, 'b' at position 2, etc.).

        "question_content": "In the kingdom of Numeria, every year the great Council of Sequences convenes to judge the Parades of Beads. Each parade presents a glittering line of beads, each bead engraved with a non-negative integer, and only whole numbers are permitted on the parade ropes. The Council\u2019s goal is to determine whether a parade\u2019s order is harmonious enough to be included in the Almanac of Ascension\u2014a book of only the most perfectly organized processions.\n\nThe Council follows ancient traditions, established generations ago. For any parade to qualify as harmonious, two rules are unfailingly observed: first, from the start to the end of the parade, each bead must be no smaller than the one before it. Strict discipline is required\u2014never can a lower number follow a higher one. Second, while tranquil repetition is allowed\u2014a bead may repeat once if it is especially precious\u2014no single number can appear more than twice in a row or elsewhere, else the Council deems the parade out of balance and disqualifies it.\n\nEach year, list upon list of bead parades is brought before the Council. A scribe is tasked to pronounce for each one the single word: \u201cTrue\u201d if the parade is harmonious according to both the order and duplication laws, and \u201cFalse\u201d if any discord is found\u2014be it a wayward bead or an exuberant overuse of repetition. This is the parade\u2019s trial by logic and law.\n\nThe Council expects submissions in a special language: each entry is presented as a list, where the parade is a sequence of whole numbers. The scribe\u2019s answer must also be in this language: only a single verdict per list\u2014either \u201cTrue\u201d or \u201cFalse,\u201d with no explanations or embellishments.\n\nFor example, when a solo bead struts alone\u2014such as in a parade containing just the number five\u2014the Council is always content and responds \u201cTrue.\u201d A perfectly ascending lineup from one through five receives a \u201cTrue,\u201d as does a greater climb like one through six or seven. But a sequence where a lesser bead sneaks ahead\u2014such as one, three, two, four, five\u2014draws swift disapproval, returned as \u201cFalse.\u201d Two of a kind, such as the sequence one, two, two, three, three, four, are appreciated for their symmetry, earning \u201cTrue.\u201d But should a number, such as two, appear thrice (as in one, two, two, two, three, four), the Council\u2019s gavel declares \u201cFalse\u201d for the violation of harmony.\n\nSo, the next bearer of lists approaches: presenting their rows of beads as numbers in the agreed sequence, they await the Council\u2019s verdict. The Council checks that the order flows upward and that no single value breaches the double-appearance accord, pronouncing \u201cTrue\u201d if all is well, or \u201cFalse\u201d if order falters. Every year, their decisions become the lore and law of Numeria, guiding beadmakers for generations yet to come.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient kingdom of Numeria, time was not passed in hours or days, but in stretches known as Threads. Each Thread, woven by the Chronomancers, represented a contiguous period in Numeria\u2019s grand Tapestry of Moments. The kingdom\u2019s scholars dubbed these Threads as intervals, each described by the instant they began and the instant they ended, and every Thread was always spun from its first point to its last, marking both as sacred and included.\n\nNow, Numerians often wished to celebrate meaningful overlaps between life events\u2014moments when two Threads entwined within the Tapestry. However, not all overlaps were deemed significant by Numerian tradition. Only those special crossings whose duration matched one of the sacred Prime-Lengths\u2014mystical numbers believed to possess unique resonance\u2014were worthy of a royal ceremony. To the Numerians, if two Threads crossed over a number of instants equal to one of these prized prime numbers, great fortune and joy would follow.\n\nThe Council of Threads issued a challenge: given any pair of these crafted Threads, determine if their shared pathway\u2014the intersection\u2014contained a length that was both positive and a Prime-Length. If that was so, a great \u201cYES\u201d would ring through Numeria; if not, the answer would forever remain \u201cNO\u201d. The Council made clear that for Threads to hold any intersection, they must truly share instants, for phantom crossings brought only misfortune.\n\nPilgrims and squires would bring pairs of Threads to the Council, each described by the two integers denoting their start and end moments. The mystics at the council\u2019s gates expected these pairs as input, and would bless the union with a single word: \u201cYES\u201d or \u201cNO\u201d as verdict.\n\nLet us recall the Council\u2019s most recent forum, where three jubilant townsfolk brought forward their Threads:\n- The first sought council with Threads stretching from the first to the second instant, and from the second to the third instant; the overlap was but one instant\u2014the council quietly replied, \u201cNO.\u201d\n- The next paired a Thread unspooling from the moment before zero to the instant at one, with another strand winding from the beginning of time to the fourth instant; their overlap spanned two instants, yet the council again returned, \u201cNO.\u201d\n- The most exuberant visitor approached with a Thread running from three units before zero to just before the dawn, paired against a grand Thread stretching from five moments before time\u2019s dawn to the fifth instant; their overlap, rich in length, covered three instants\u2014an honored Prime-Length. The council grinned and answered: \u201cYES.\u201d\n\nThus, in Numeria, all queries were judged, and Words of Fate (\u201cYES\u201d or \u201cNO\u201d) were woven into legend, honoring every example brought before the mystic council\u2014each reflecting not only the logic of the Council, but the very fabric of Numeria\u2019s mysterious world.",

        "question_content": "Long ago, in the bustling merchant city of Magnitara, trade was not conducted in coins or goods, but in a peculiar system known as the Weighing of Fates. Each merchant arrived in the morning market carrying a collection of magical stones\u2014each stone pulsing with an energy of its own. Some stones glowed brightly with hope (these radiated a positive aura), others shimmered with sorrow (these had a negative essence), and a rare few hung heavy and inert (these were said to possess no destiny at all, neither light nor dark).\n\nThe city's barter council set forth a unique rule for all exchanges: to determine the total worth of any merchant's stones, a special ritual had to be performed. First, the sum of the pure power inside each stone was measured\u2014completely disregarding whether the aura was positive or negative, the sages scraped away all meaning except the sheer quantity of energy. Then, the true test came: all the auras of the stones were woven together. If every stone shared only positive and negative auras, the council sages would align their destinies using a mystic seal\u2014if an even number of stones held sorrow, hope triumphed; if odd, sorrow prevailed. But if even a single inert stone was discovered, then the ritual was abandoned and the worth was declared null for that day.\n\nSo arose the Rule of Magnitara: to compute the value of a collection, one must tally the individual might of each stone (that is\u2014the sum of every power, stripped of its sign), then, if all stones are marked either for hope or for sorrow, multiply this total by a power that is bright for hope, shadowed for sorrow, or nullified if inert stone is found. But the council quashed all attempts to perform this magic with an empty satchel of stones\u2014empty hands produced no value and required no ritual.\n\nIn practice, wandering merchants seeking guidance would approach the council with a scroll (the input) bearing the weights and auras of their stones. They expected a single response (the output): the value of their hoard, transformed by the ritual. If the scroll listed no stones, the council scribes would return \u201cNone\u201d\u2014a sign of emptiness and inactivity.\n\nFor example: one morning, a merchant offered four stones with powers: one, two, two, and negative four. The council measured the might as one plus two plus two plus four (ignoring the despair embedded in the last), yielding a sum of nine. But, when weaving the auras together\u2014a process akin to multiplying one, one, one, and negative one\u2014they found sorrow prevailed, and the sum was cloaked in shadow, rendering the final value negative nine. In another case, if a merchant\u2019s collection included a stone of inert destiny (zero), the value was nullified instantly. And should a merchant arrive empty-handed, the council returned nothing at all.\n\nThus, the city flourished beneath the wisdom of the Weighing of Fates, as every deal and fortune could be traced to the immutable logic of the stones' powers and intermingled destinies. For every query, the ritual followed a precise intake (a list of powers and auras) and returned the uniquely calculated worth\u2014or a sign of none, should fate decree it.",

        "question_content": "In the heart of the crystalline city of Lexiconia, secret society initiates would gather once each cycle to attempt the famed Path of Selection. In Lexiconia, the ground itself was laid as a perfect N by N grid of radiant tiles, and inscribed upon these tiles were the integers from one to the city\u2019s highest magic number\u2014no integer was repeated, and none were missing. Each year, as the Ceremony of Choices began, a number known as the \u201cstride count\u201d was announced\u2014this determined precisely how many footsteps each initiate must take on the glowing tiles, stepping only on adjacent stones, and never leaving the city\u2019s woven boundaries.\n\nTradition in Lexiconia was strict: every initiate could start their journey upon any magical stone they chose. With each step, they could only leap to one of the perfectly neighboring stones\u2014never diagonally, mind you, but always through the city\u2019s straight veins, following an edge from one stone to the next. These paths need not avoid revisiting a tile; sometimes, in pursuit of destiny, an initiate\u2019s footsteps retraced themselves.\n\nBut the society\u2019s challenge was not simply to assemble any path of the correct length. The Path of Selection demanded that the initiate walk precisely the number of steps dictated by the stride count, recording the value carved onto each tile as they went. Of all possible journeys of the prescribed length, the truly honored were those whose sequence of numbers formed the smallest lexicon; that is, the earliest possible order in the city\u2019s numerical histories. The contest was thus not of speed or distance, but of subtle wisdom: to divine the exact ordered trail of tile numbers that would place a seeker ahead of all rivals, even if by a single humble digit. Lexiconia\u2019s greatest scholars had mathematically proven that there was always one unique \"minimum sequence\" for every challenge.\n\nWhen the Ceremony began, the initiates would receive a parchment inscribed with the current city pattern\u2014a square grid recording the numerals upon each magical stone\u2014as well as the stride count for this test. Their parchments would describe the grid as a matrix of numbers (for example: a spiral from one to nine arranged in rows and columns) and the stride count as a single number. The ceremony-masters would then await the contenders\u2019 answer: an ordered list of the numbers stepped upon, written as they were encountered, representing the most lexicographically minimal journey, according to the city\u2019s sacred principle.\n\nFor instance, at the Ceremony of the Third Stride, when the tiles were arrayed as:\n```\n[ [1, 2, 3],\n  [4, 5, 6],\n  [7, 8, 9] ]\n```\nand the stride count was three, the first initiate to walk the lowest lexiconal path reported the sequence: `[1, 2, 1]`. In another year, with the tiles set as:\n```\n[ [5, 9, 3],\n  [4, 1, 6],\n  [7, 8, 2] ]\n```\nand only a single step permitted, the minimal answer was simply: `[1]`.\n\nThus, to claim victory in Lexiconia\u2019s legendary rite, one must examine the grid\u2019s arrangement and the stride count, return through some mechanical rite an ordered list of the values encountered (with the length matching the stride count), written exactly as:\n- Input: A parchment showing both the grid (a list of lists, each inner list representing a row) and the stride count (a single number),\n- Output: A list of the values passed, in order, as the initiate moves tile to tile.\nFor each ceremony, the sample parchment and answer would look as in the examples above, and the explanation for each answer matched the illustrious city\u2019s logic. Thus were the paths to greatness charted in Lexiconia\u2014by wisdom, intuition, and the sharpest awareness of order across the city\u2019s radiant stones.",

        "question_content": "In the distant realm of Mathemagica, two ancient kingdoms, Arithma and Divisia, were famed for their grand festivals held on the rare occasion when both their royal clocks struck at the same moment. Legend had it that the harmony between these lands could be measured by the greatest chime\u2014the loudest bell tone that both kingdoms could ring evenly without discord after their own unique intervals. The elders said that discovering this greatest shared bell toll was a potent sign of unity and prosperity.\n\nIn preparation for the upcoming Harmony Festival, the High Council summoned the kingdom\u2019s cleverest minds to solve a crucial riddle. Each festival cycle, Arithma\u2019s clock tolled after a certain number of beats, while Divisia\u2019s clock chimed after a different number of beats. The Council needed to know: **What is the grandest toll that both clocks can ring perfectly in time, so that no matter how many times their bells ring, the intervals will align flawlessly at this greatest shared moment?** In other words, the council sought the highest number that could evenly fit into both kingdoms\u2019 bell cycles\u2014so that whenever this number of beats had passed, both clocks would ring together.\n\nThe ancient tradition decreed a simple process for presenting this riddle: a messenger would approach with two numbers, one for Arithma\u2019s clock and one for Divisia\u2019s, each representing their clock\u2019s unique cycle. The council\u2019s task was to reveal the largest possible number of beats that could divide both cycles without leaving any leftover beats. This number was known as the \u201cGreatest Common Chime.\u201d\n\nTo pose their question, festival organizers would send forth a parchment bearing two numbers, side by side, on a single line\u2014first Arithma\u2019s clock cycle, and then Divisia\u2019s. The council\u2019s answer, a single number written on the next line, was the count of beats in the grandest toll both clocks could ring together. Thus, the input to the Harmony Riddle was always two numbers on one line, and the output was their greatest shared toll.\n\nFor example, when a messenger arrived with the numbers \u201c3 5,\u201d the council quickly replied, \u201c1,\u201d for that was the only chime that could echo through both halls at regular intervals. If instead the numbers were \u201c25 15,\u201d the answer would be \u201c5,\u201d as this was the fullest, grandest toll dividing both cycles evenly.\n\nSo, whenever the Harmony Festival neared, the council would consult this practice, ensuring the chimes of Arithma and Divisia rang in perfect, thunderous unison\u2014guided by the simple rule: find the greatest number by which both cycles are evenly measured, and let it be the voice of unity throughout the land.",

        "question_content": "In the distant realm of Numeria, scholars had long celebrated the celebrated legacy of the Fibonacci Family, whose lineage of numbers stretched back generations, each new number born from the wisdom of the two before it. Yet hidden deep within the arched corridors of the Academy of Infinite Patterns, a secretive sect whispered of a mysterious, sibling clan: the House of Tribonacci. Their lore was ensconced in winding pattern-work, less famous, but no less remarkable.\n\nThis house followed customs all their own. The eldest child, always the firstborn, bore the crest of three\u2014no more, no less. When twins were born at once, the midwives would add their number together, wearied by the endless squabbles twins would bring, until they settled the matter by declaring the worth of any even-numbered heir to always be one higher than half their birth position. Yet for the odd-numbered children, things were more labyrinthine: each would determine their legacy not just by their immediate predecessors, but also by the guidance of the next sibling yet to come, combining all three fates into one sum to tell of their own.\n\nThe Grand Archivist has arrived at your doorstep with a request. She presents you with a single document: a non-negative integer, which she cryptically calls the \u201cOrder of Heirs.\u201d She tasks you to summon forth the House\u2019s history\u2014craft a scroll listing the values of every child from the newborn at position zero right up to the one whose place matches the given number. She insists each record be inscribed orderly, left to right, so that every entry reflects the House of Tribonacci\u2019s legacy, as dictated by birth order:  \n\n- The historian must always begin the genealogy with the first heir claiming the value three, symbolic of the founding principles.\n- For every even-placed sibling (excluding the very first), the recorders calculate their worth as one plus half of their position in the queue.\n- But for those given odd, unpaired birth positions beyond the first, the sum of their immediate elder, their next-oldest sibling before that, and the promise of the next-yet-to-come (who will be calculated later or is already known if further down the scroll) all blend together to set their fate.\n\nThus, the Grand Archivist\u2019s task is clear: for a given Order of Heirs, produce a single scroll written as a sequence\u2014a list\u2014of each heir\u2019s worth in order, starting from position zero up to the Order\u2019s number. The scroll should be offered in the legendary Numerian format: a list, where commas separate values and the entire sequence is enclosed within square brackets. For example, a command delivered as \u201cthree\u201d shall yield the scroll [1, 3, 2, 8].\n\nLet us wander through an example: suppose the Archivist requests a scroll for an Order of Heirs numbered three. Then, our recording proceeds thus: position zero (the youngest) is charted as one (for the House\u2019s count begins with this peculiar offset), position one becomes three (the family\u2019s crest), position two is determined to be two (since it is even, so one plus half of two), and position three (an odd position) becomes the grand sum\u2014the worth of position two, the founding three, and position four (which, being even and not yet known, is quickly noted as three, since one plus half of four gives three), together totaling eight.\n\nAnd so, the House of Tribonacci\u2019s incantation unfolds: at your command, the House\u2019s scroll is summoned by recording a single number for the Order of Heirs and returning a list in the Numerian tradition. To recapitulate the example, for \u201cthree,\u201d the result would be inscribed as [1, 3, 2, 8].",

        "question_content": "In the bustling mechanical city of Numeria, every citizen is identified not by name, but by their unique sequence of glowing digits etched onto shimmering brass plates. Each morning, the Council of Odds and Evens holds a grand competition to honor those who bear the spark of individuality\u2014those whose numbers contain that rebellious, odd energy that fuels the city\u2019s innovation. Of all the customs in Numeria, none is more revered than the Ritual of Odd Unity.\n\nThe rules of the Ritual are set in stone and passed down through generations. Whenever a citizen arrives before the Council, the elders meticulously examine the number sequence carved upon their plate. For every odd digit\u2014those unyielding characters like 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9\u2014the council softly chants, multiplying the value of each together, weaving their stubborn strength into a single, growing ember. Contrary to this, even digits\u20140, 2, 4, 6, and 8\u2014are respectfully ignored during the multiplication; their contribution to the ritual is silence, for their nature is to follow the path, not challenge it.\n\nShould a citizen's entire identity be forged only from the disciplined, even digits\u2014those steady cogs upon which the city runs\u2014then, to the Council, their ritual fuel is absent, and their contribution is declared as nothing more than a silent zero, a moment of acknowledgment for the quiet lives that keep the city turning smoothly behind the scenes. However, if at least one odd digit glimmers among the brass, the Ritual continues, culminating in their proud multiplication\u2014each odd digit fusing with the next to create a spark unique to that citizen.\n\nWhen you, the Ritual\u2019s appointed Scribe, are asked to take part, you are handed a scroll\u2014a number. Your task is clear: for any positive number presented to you, seek out its odd digits, and weave their multiplied value into a single, ceremonial number. If the number is composed solely of even digits, mark the result as zero\u2014a sign that no odd spark was found. The Council relies on your answer, for it is tradition to honor efficiency and precision above all; never multiply more than necessary nor forget a single odd.\n\nThe proceedings require a simple act from you. When called upon, you are granted a single positive integer and must return a solitary number as your answer: the total product of all the odd digits, or zero if none are present. For example, if the plate reads one, the answer is one\u2014the sole odd digit stands alone. Should it shine with four, the answer is zero, for it is formed of a single even cog. But if the number is two-three-five, your answer is fifteen, binding together the three (odd) and five (odd) for a product of fifteen, while respectfully ignoring the two (even).\n\nSo remember, when the Council requests your calculation, provide only what the Ritual demands. Each response is an echo of Numeria's enduring dance between odd sparks and even steadiness\u2014a reminder that, sometimes, the boldest creations come from multiplying the uncommon.",

        "question_content": "Once upon a time, in the mystical realm of Brackethold, a peculiar tradition governed the communication among its inhabitants. Every message shared among the denizens was crafted exclusively using the ancient runes of \u201copen\u201d and \u201cclose\u201d\u2014 depicted as sacred left and right square symbols. To outsiders, such scripts looked like random patterns, but within the city\u2019s high towers, scholars knew these patterns possessed profound meaning, governing whether a conversation was considered subtle and nuanced or plain and mundane.\n\nAccording to the laws of Brackethold, a conversation was celebrated as \u201clayered\u201d if, within any sequence of exchanges (that did not need to be contiguous), there existed at least one moment when a response was enclosed within an ongoing utterance\u2014an exchange safely tucked inside another, much like a letter inside an envelope, itself sealed within another envelope. In other words, the council only honored dialogues that displayed a nesting of ideas, where a reply was not merely adjacent to another, but nested firmly within. Conversely, a series of parallel remarks, no matter how plentiful, were seen as dull: if every matching pair began and ended without interleaving, the council would dismiss it as unlayered. If at least one layering could be found in any possible arrangement, the discussion was prized.\n\nThe Grand Recorder of Brackethold, ever methodical, developed a ritual for appraising conversations. Given a string of runes crafted solely from the open and close symbols, he wished to verify if the message, through any possible selection of runes (chosen in order, but not necessarily consecutively), contained a moment of true nesting. To contribute to the archives, the task was, for any supplied message, to declare whether it qualified as \u201clayered\u201d and thus worthy of preservation.\n\nFor the scribes recording judgments, the process was clear: present a function that would accept, as input, any Bracketholdian message\u2014that is, a single string made up of only the square rune symbols. The desired outcome was a declaration of \u2018True\u2019 if the message harbored a \u201clayered\u201d subsequence, or \u2018False\u2019 otherwise. The function was thus is_nested(message_string) \u2192 Boolean (either True or False).\n\nAmong the records, a scribe presented these notable examples: When the message was \u2018[[]]\u2019, the council rejoiced\u2014clearly, there was a layer present (True). Should the message consist of scattered, unmatching relics like \u2018[]]]]]]][[[[[]\u2019, the magic was lost (False). For messages that resembled two plain pairs like \u2018[][]\u2019, or even just a single pair \u2018[]\u2019, the conversation was unlayered (False). But if a message featured complexity such as \u2018[[][]]\u2019\u2014where overlapping could be found\u2014the decree was (True). As for \u2018[[]][[\u2019, where at least one part held a layering, the council again declared (True).\n\nAnd so, the tradition lived on: whenever a new conversation was submitted, it was examined for its depth, and only those with authentic nesting\u2014verified in the Grand Recorder\u2019s fashion\u2014were forever etched into the Chronicle of Brackethold.",

        "question_content": "In the mystical land of Arithmia, every number is a little spirit, wandering freely across hills and valleys. These spirits reside within enchanted stones collected by the villagers. The elders have long observed that whenever a spirit\u2019s strength is measured, it must be \"rounded up\"\u2014that is, any fractional power they possess must be magically boosted to the next whole integer, no matter how small. For instance, a spirit with a strength of 1.1 or 1.9 becomes as robust as one with a strength of 2. Should the spirit already dwell at a whole number, nothing changes\u2014the magic knows where to stop.\n\nAs dusk falls and festival preparations begin, the High Scribe sets out a peculiar challenge to the village\u2019s apprentices. She lays out a selection of spirit stones\u2014a list of numbers, some whole, some with fractions, some even negative or at rest with zero energy. The Scribe's challenge: for each spirit stone, the apprentice must first infuse it with just enough power to reach at least the next highest full integer. After this awakening, they must determine the spirit\u2019s \u201ctrue might\u201d by squaring its strength, watching as the energy multiplies itself. Finally, the Scribe asks for a single tribute: the sum of all these squared strengths, a number that tells of the stones' combined, fully-awakened might.\n\nTo officially record the results, the Scribe states that the sequence of spirit stones shall be passed to the apprentice in the form of a list of numbers inscribed upon a scroll. In return, the apprentice writes back a single number\u2014the sum of all squared, fully-awakened strengths. For example: if handed the scroll [1, 2, 3], the apprentice reports back with 14, bowing respectfully as this represents (1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2). For other arrangements, such as [1.4, 4.2, 0], the apprentice carefully rounds each number up (to 2, 5, 0), squares them (yielding 4, 25, 0), and tallies the sum, reporting 29.\n\nSome spirit stones may arise with seemingly low energies\u2014perhaps even negative, like [-2.4, 1, 1]. Yet, when rounded up (-2 in this case), squared (becoming 4), and combined with the squares of the others (1 for each), the total spirit is revealed as 6. The Scribe reminds the apprentices: every result must strictly follow the order of awakening (round up, then square, always before combining), and the stones must never be left unawakened.\n\nHere is how the sequence of events would unfold for input and output: a scroll bearing a list such as [a, b, c] is presented, and the only expected answer is a single number\u2014the total combined might after the ritual. For [1, 2, 3], the humble apprentice replies with just 14. If the scroll reads [1.4, 4.2, 0], the answer is 29.\n\nAmong the apprentices, sharing and checking examples is customary. For the scrolls handed out recently, these are the answers that delighted the High Scribe:\n\n- Presented with [1, 2, 3], the answer was 14.\n- Handed [1, 4, 9], the answer was 98.\n- With [1, 3, 5, 7], the answer was 84.\n- For [1.4, 4.2, 0], the combined might became 29.\n- When [-2.4, 1, 1] was encountered, the answer was 6.\n\nAnd so, the custom continues\u2014each new scroll is approached in this magical way: round each spirit\u2019s power up, square it to reveal its true force, and sum them for the Scribe\u2019s approval, ensuring the village\u2019s tales are rich with fully-awakened spirit stones.",

For each spirit stone, it first rounds up the spirit's strength to the next whole integer using the `int()` function. If the spirit's strength is negative, it adds 1 to round up the strength to the next whole integer. Then, it squares the spirit's rounded strength using the `**` operator. Finally, it adds the squared strength to the total sum. The function returns the total sum after iterating over all spirit stones.\n",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Lexiconia, communication isn\u2019t simply a means\u2014it\u2019s an art, governed by ancient customs that shape every story, message, and order passed between the city\u2019s denizens. Here, the Scholars of Syntax gather each evening to judge the worthiness of new missives, and their evaluations are rooted in the city\u2019s peculiar traditions about words and letters.\n\nOne such tradition focuses on the final touch of every message: the very last symbol scrawled on the parchment. The Scholars believe that messages gain a mystical clarity if the last mark is an alphabet letter that stands alone\u2014meaning it is not clinging to others as part of a word but appearing after the last word\u2019s end. To determine a message\u2019s clarity, the Scholars examine whether this last symbol is indeed a solo letter, unbound from a word. If it is, the missive is deemed to possess a rare clarity; if not, it is cast into obscurity.\n\nYour task, as the city\u2019s apprentice Coder, is to craft an enchanted parchment\u2014a function, as the Scholars call it. This function, when handed a strip of text, must return a mark of approval if the message ends with an alphabet character not belonging to any word (that is, if the letter is the last character and stands alone after the last space). It must return disapproval otherwise: if the last character is not a letter, if it sits as part of a longer word, if the message is empty, or if stray spaces trail after the last letter. Parchments are always presented as a series of characters, and their judgment\u2014approval or disapproval\u2014is given in the staple Lexiconian terms: True (for clear) or False (for obscure).\n\nMessages (inputs) are always passed as a single strip of text (string). The decree (output) must be either True or False, declaring, with unwavering certainty, whether the final character is a standalone letter. See below how the Scholars expect messages and their clarity to be displayed:\n\n**Input:**  \nA single string, offered as  \n`\"the message appearing here\"`\n\n**Output:**  \nEither True or False, based on the Lexiconian rule.\n\nConsider these legendary past judgments:\n- For the message `\"apple pie\"`, clarity was denied (False), for the final letter \u2018e\u2019 was part of the word \"pie\".\n- For the message `\"apple pi e\"`, clarity was granted (True), as the \u2018e\u2019 stood bravely at the end, a lone letter after a space.\n- When the message bore a trailing space, as in `\"apple pi e \"`, clarity turned to shadow (False), for the space masked any solitary letter at the end.\n- And to a silent parchment, bearing no marks at all (`\"\"`), clarity was, of course, impossible (False).\n\nSo it is in Lexiconia: every message\u2019s magic depends upon the final, solitary step of its journey\u2014will your code uphold this ancient custom and bring clarity to the city\u2019s evening councils?",

Only those who could walk taller than the person immediately before them were allowed to advance unimpeded\u2014each stride representing a step toward collective progress, never looking back nor stooping beneath another's achievement.\n\nAccording to the unwavering laws of Listoria, once the parade began, every participant had to outshine\u2014stepwise\u2014the peer ahead of them. The villagers knew, all too well, that the moment someone stumbled and failed to surpass or match the \u00e9clat of their direct predecessor, a rumble of disappointment spread, marking the farthest point where their harmony would fracture. If every villager succeeded in this upward march, the town rejoiced with a chorus of perfect unity. But should someone falter, the council would note\u2014with unerring accuracy\u2014the highest position reached where the sequence first crumbled.\n\nThe Keeper of Arrangements, a venerable judge, was tasked with reviewing the parade\u2019s progress. Presented with a scroll inscribed with the villagers\u2019 heights in procession order, the Keeper must scan for the *largest position* where a participant did not succeed in stepping tall over the shoes of the one before. If no such misstep marred the line\u2014all had walked with increasingly proud heights\u2014the Keeper would record a mark of perfect order, declared by the proud number, minus one.\n\nTo assist all who sought to join this tradition, the wisdom of Listoria decreed a method: entrants must scribe, in order, a list of numbers representing ascent, and await an answer\u2014if perfect, the Keeper returns the sign of flawlessness, which is minus one; but if imperfect, the Keeper solemnly declares the highest position (counted from the start, beginning at one) of the latest slip, counting, as tradition went, using the system of the scholars called \u201cindices,\u201d whose count began with zero for the first villager in the line.\n\nFor example, a scroll held the heights: one, two, four, three, and five. The Keeper\u2019s gaze slid from each to the next, and all went well until the one who stood after the four could not outshine their predecessor\u2014there, at the fourth position (starting at zero), progress failed. The Keeper declared the number three (for the one who faltered after the start, second, and third). Yet in a line where the scroll read: one, two, then three, each participant sailed higher than the last. The Keeper, beaming, revealed the answer: minus one, indicating supreme harmony.\n\nThus, throughout Listoria, all knew to prepare their march under these rules, presenting their order in a scroll as a list of heights (like `[1,2,4,3,5]` or `[1,2,3]`), to receive from the Keeper either the last failure\u2019s position (e.g., `3`), or the blessing of flawlessness (`-1`)\u2014each answer mapped precisely to the corresponding scroll, as justice and tradition demanded.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling kingdom of Numeria, there existed a magical archive known as the Listoria Scrolls\u2014a tattered parchment upon which the inhabitants would occasionally inscribe numbers to record the happenings of daily life. In this land, negative numbers were thought of as the mysterious \u201cShadefolk,\u201d beings from the realms below, and positive numbers were known as the radiant \u201cLightbearers,\u201d children of the sunlit hills. Zeroes, however, carried no particular allegiance and were seen as Hermits, wandering between worlds.\n\nTraditionally, Numerian scholars had a ritual whenever a new Scroll was presented: they would seek the most prominent Shadefolk\u2014the deepest denizen from below ground, that is, the negative dweller closest to the borderlands of zero\u2014and also try to find the most humble Lightbearer, the sun-child who stood nearest to the Hermits. These two, the greatest of the Shadefolk and the least of the Lightbearers, were celebrated for being at the crossroads of their peoples.\n\nThe Archive\u2019s chief sage, tasked with extracting wisdom from these Scrolls, would perform a specific function each time a Scroll was unfurled. She would hunt through all entries to find out if there were any Shadefolk hidden amongst the numbers. If none could be found, she would record their absence as a sign\u2014\"None.\" The same went for the Lightbearers: if their gentle presence was missing, she too would write \"None.\" If both were missing\u2014if the Scroll was empty or contained only Hermits\u2014she would mark both with this sign.\n\nScholars had set forth a custom for recording the results. Each time the ritual was performed, the sage would announce her findings as an ordered pair, placing the name of the mightiest Shadefolk first and the humblest Lightbearer second. In their chronicles, this was recorded as a tuple: the first spot reserved for the greatest Shadefolk, the second for the least Lightbearer, with \u201cNone\u201d entered if a people were absent.\n\nFor example, when a Scroll arrived bearing the marks [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7], the sage would note that there were no Shadefolk present, but the humblest Lightbearer was the one named One. The declaration would then be written as (None, 1). If a Scroll were empty, both Shadefolk and Lightbearers were missing, and the record read (None, None). On the rare occasion that only Hermits appeared upon the page, as in the case where a lone zero showed up, the same fate befell the archives: (None, None).\n\nAnd so, the scholars of Numeria continued this tradition, forever seeking the greatest of Shadefolk and the humblest of Lightbearers in their magical Scrolls, careful to record their findings in these pairs, ever mindful that absence was sometimes every bit as telling as presence.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Numeralis, life is governed not by kings and queens, but by the strange and whimsical Order of the Scales. The Order\u2019s sacred duty is to settle disputes between Numbers who, much like people, can come in several shapes and forms\u2014some as robust integers, others as nimble floating-point denizens, and yet others as clever shapeshifters disguised in strings. This city, built on a river that flows both with points and commas, reveres harmony and equality, but values strength and magnitude even more.\n\nWithin Numeralis, it is said that whenever two entities\u2014be they proud whole numbers, lithe decimals, or numbers cloaked in language\u2014square off, the Order must judge who is greater. Yet tradition holds that a number\u2019s true self, whether cloaked or naked, is always respected. Thus, if a figure appears adorned in literary garb\u2014say, \"4,2\" or \"7.3\"\u2014the Order must decipher whether its value matches or exceeds its rival, considering the local custom that commas and dots mean much the same along the riverside.\n\nNow, the Order\u2019s rituals are exacting. When two folk of different types emerge, their essence is weighed: both figures must first be stripped to their true values, with string garments converted respectfully (dots or commas alike) into real numbers. Whomever stands taller in strength\u2014in other words, has the greater magnitude\u2014is declared the victor and returns in their own attire. Yet, should both challengers turn out to be equally matched, the result is a dignified stalemate, and none is favored above the other.\n\nWhen the Grand Scribe receives a petition, it appears thus: two citizens are brought forth in their native attire\u2014perhaps as a pair of plain numbers, perhaps a number and a string, or two strings both masquerading as numbers. The court\u2019s secret function, known in legend as `compare_one`, is invoked. It judges as follows: it declares the stronger of the two, that is, the one with greatest value, and always returns the victor in their original guise\u2014integer, floating-point, or string. In the rare case of perfect equality, the Order proclaims a dignified \"None\" in solemn recognition of balance.\n\nFor example, if a modest integer meets a mightier floating-point, it is the latter who returns. If an unassuming integer faces a string-cloaked figure such as \"2,3\", the shapeshifter wins as their value is greater, yet keeps their ambiguous cloak (\"2,3\"). Should two string-cloaked contenders, like \"5,1\" and \"6\", meet, the one with the greater concealed strength comes forth, still disguised. But when two equally matched citizens\u2014say, the integer one and its string-twin \"1\"\u2014contest, the council bows to their equality and returns no judgment (None).\n\nThe wise Order records all such encounters for learning and justice:\n\n- When pitted: 1 against 2.5, the champion is 2.5.\n- When summoned: 1 and \"2,3\", the victor is \"2,3\".\n- Set against: \"5,1\" and \"6\", the winner is \"6\".\n- And upon: \"1\" and 1, there is peace, none is privileged.\n\nThus, in Numeralis, every comparison upholds the sacred rules: the truest value prevails, attire is respected, and equality is honored above all else.",

        "question_content": "In the land of Numeria, a peculiar tradition flourishes among its mathematician guilds: the art of crafting enchanted talismans with specific numeric values. The High Sage, keeper of ancient customs, has proposed a new riddle to his apprentices. Each apprentice is handed a single mystical coin, with a number engraved upon it. The numbers entrusted can range deep into the thousands and beyond, but a singular question hangs in the air\u2014can such a number be artfully fashioned by combining the energies of four distinct moonstones, each brimming with an even count of power, and each bearing a glow that marks it as alive and positive?\n\nThe rules of this tradition are strict and unyielding: when forming a talisman, the recipient must select exactly four moonstones to fuse, no more and no less. Each moonstone must pulse with an amount of energy divisible by the lunar cycle\u2014meaning every stone holds an even quantity of power, no odd stones allowed. Furthermore, every chosen stone must shimmer with at least a single unit of energy (but naturally, since they are even, this means two units at the very least).\n\nThe challenge placed before each apprentice is thus: given any number bestowed by the High Sage in the form of their mystical coin, determine whether it is possible to forge a talisman with exactly four positive, even moonstones, so their energies sum up to precisely match the coin\u2019s value. The sage seeks clarity\u2014this must be solved as efficiently as possible, not through guesswork or trial, but through logic that scales with any mystical number he might cast before them.\n\nTo communicate their discoveries, the apprentices use an enchanted parchment, upon which they inscribe their answers in a simple form: `True` if the number on the coin can indeed be conjured from exactly four positive, even moonstones, or `False` if no such summoning is possible. The input given is always a single number, to which the apprentice answers in this binary tradition.\n\nFor example, apprentice Lyra, upon receiving a coin marked with \u201c4,\u201d examines the rules and finds it impossible to gather four positive, even stones (since the smallest possible sum is already eight), so she writes `False`. Apprentice Milo, given a \u201c6,\u201d faces a similar predicament, concluding `False` as well. Meanwhile, when a coin with the symbol \u201c8\u201d appears, apprentice Saya realizes that four stones, each humming with just two units, can be united\u2014so she jubilantly records `True`. Thus, from every corner of Numeria, the apprentices submit their findings: a coin marked \u201c4\u201d yields `False`, \u201c6\u201d yields `False`, and \u201c8\u201d yields `True`, honoring the sage\u2019s stringent yet wondrous tradition.",

It uses nested loops to generate all possible combinations of four numbers. The outermost loop starts from 2 and increments by 2 each time, which ensures that the numbers are even. The inner loops work similarly, starting from 2 and incrementing by 2, but the range is adjusted to ensure that the sum of the numbers being added together is less than `n`. The last number `l` is calculated by subtracting the sum of the other three numbers from `n`. If the sum of the four numbers equals `n`, the function returns `True`. If no such combination is found after checking all possible combinations, the function returns `False`.\n",

If it is, it's impossible to form a talisman with four positive, even stones that sum to the number, so the function returns False. If the number is 8 or greater, the function checks if it's divisible by 4. If it is, it's possible to form a talisman, so the function returns True.

        "question_content": "In the heart of the ancient empire of Arithmos, there stood a grand Tower of Trials, revered by all for its enigmatic challenges. Each aspiring Sage traveled from distant lands, seeking to conquer the legendary ritual known as the **Brazilian Rite of Factorials**, said to bestow great wisdom upon those who could complete it. The ritual, devised by the mathematician-priesthood, was as much a puzzle as it was a measure of perseverance and intellect.\n\nThe priests laid down a singular, meticulous doctrine: each Sage, upon being given a ceremonial number\u2014let us call it N\u2014was tasked to gather the mystical factorial stones associated with every step from their given number all the way down to the humble one. These stones, each imbued with the force of their corresponding numbers\u2019 multiplicative essence (that is, a stone marked K carried the power of all numbers from one to K multiplied together), were to be combined in a grand confluence. Notably, the sum of the stones would not suffice; the true test required these forces to be multiplied together, forging a single resplendent artifact of power.\n\nThus, for a Sage given the number N, the rite demanded that they find the factorial of N, then the factorial of one less than N, then of two less than N, and so on\u2014accumulating the factorials of every whole number down to one. Only when every step had been honored, and every factorial had been accounted for and multiplied with immaculate care, would the Priesthood judge the rite complete. The greatest achievement, as the legend dictated, was to perform this ritual with the highest efficiency\u2014gathering no excess stones and combining them flawlessly.\n\nIn practical terms, the rite\u2019s challenge could be expressed as follows: Sages would present a single sacred integer upon arrival. Their appointed task was to determine, as quickly and wisely as possible, the ultimate value formed by multiplying the factorial of their whole number with the factorials of every smaller positive whole number in descending order, until one was reached. The completed artifact\u2014a single mighty integer\u2014would symbolize how fully the Sage had embraced the logic of the Rite.\n\nThe Priesthood\u2019s records included several instructive tales. For instance, when a Sage received the ceremonial number four, they would gather the factorials of four, three, two, and one\u2014namely, twenty-four, six, two, and one. Multiplying these together in a reverent sequence, the result was two hundred eighty-eight, a figure etched into the archives as a paragon of ritual completion.\n\nIn their archives, the Temple also preserved written instructions for later Sages, specifying that the challenge would be posed as follows: \u201cGiven an integer N as input, determine the product of N!, (N-1)!, ..., down to 1!; return this as a single number.\u201d Wise Scribes carefully noted input and output examples:  \n**Input:** `4`  \n**Output:** `288`  \n**Explanation:** \"The Sage gathered: 4! = 24, 3! = 6, 2! = 2, 1! = 1. The product is 24 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 288.\u201d  \nThus, every Sage who entered the Tower sought not just to complete, but to perfect, the Rite of the Brazilian Factorial.",

        "question_content": "In the mystical Kingdom of Lexiconia, every word holds a secret\u2014each one conceals a trail of magical glyphs that grow, one after the other, to form the word\u2019s true power. The scholars of Lexiconia believe that to understand a word\u2019s essence, one must study every path it takes from its very first glyph up to its final, complete form. This ancient art is called the Prefix Pilgrimage.\n\nIn Lexiconia, when a word is spoken, it is not enough to simply recite its entire incantation. The wise ones have mandated a ritual: for any word chosen, a scribe must carefully record every blossoming stage of the word, starting with the very first glyph, then the first two, and so forth, until the entire word is revealed. No stage can be skipped, and the order is always from the shortest path to the longest. Through this, the scribes believe they can harness the word\u2019s layered enchantments.\n\nYoung apprentices are often tested on this ritual. Given a single word, they must list each stage of its growth, from the lone initial glyph to its grand finale. The challenge is not to choose random fragments or to skip ahead, but to ensure that every possible beginning\u2014each successive stretch from the start right up to every point in the word\u2014is honored, with nothing left out and nothing repeated.\n\nWhen a scholar is presented with a word, for example, \u201cabc,\u201d they must carefully recite: first \u201ca,\u201d then \u201cab,\u201d and finally \u201cabc.\u201d For a longer word, say \u201cmagic,\u201d the recitation would be: \u201cm,\u201d \u201cma,\u201d \u201cmag,\u201d \u201cmagi,\u201d and at last \u201cmagic.\u201d The task is always to capture the word\u2019s unfolding, step by careful step.\n\nTo join the ranks of Lexiconia\u2019s wise, an apprentice must be able to perform this ritual for any word the Elders provide. The apprentice will receive the word as an offering\u2014written plainly as a single line, with no extra markings or spaces. They must then respond with a list, each line or entry being one of the word\u2019s magical beginnings, starting with the very first glyph and ending with the complete word.\n\nFor instance, if an apprentice is challenged with the word \u201cabc,\u201d they must record:  \na  \nab  \nabc  \nThis shows their deep respect for the word\u2019s power and their mastery of the Prefix Pilgrimage. And so, the tradition continues, with each scholar passing on the secret of the word\u2019s unfolding path to those who come after.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Verbatim, the people cherished clarity in their speech and writing above all else. Their city scrolls, messages, and records were meticulously crafted so that no ambiguity could worm its way in. Each word and pause had meaning, but the spaces between\u2014a vital part of their language called \"whispers\"\u2014required careful management. The Council of Lexicons decreed precise ways whispers were to be represented, ensuring that every document read as smoothly as a well-composed symphony.\n\nThe ancient law of Verbatim, set down for all scribes and message carriers, described two main edicts about these whispers. Whenever a single pause occurred between two words, or even at the edges of a message, it was to be marked by an unbroken bridge called the \u201cunderscore.\u201d This graceful line kept the conversation flowing, letting one\u2019s eyes glide from thought to thought without hesitation. However, if a more dramatic hush arose\u2014a pause of three or more heartbeats in length\u2014the Council demanded a different mark, the \u201cdash,\u201d painted boldly in place of all those pauses, to draw attention to the greater separation.\n\nMessengers and scribes received a new challenge from the Council: devise a method that, given any spoken or written phrase, would transform it so all minor whispers became underscores, and any extended silences\u2014those of three or more spaces\u2014became a single emphatic dash. The law was clear: this transformation must occur for the entire message, however it began or ended, to guard against any misunderstanding in communication. Of note, the Council forbade the use of overt symbols like \u201cvariable for the string\u201d or direct conversations about \u201cspaces\u201d or \u201ccharacters\u201d\u2014the scribes must speak naturally, letting the message\u2019s flow reveal its intent.\n\nTo formalize their efforts, the scribes established a ritual: when a resident brought a phrase for translation, it would be spoken aloud as a single line for the enchantment. The enchantment would produce a single line in response, reflecting the Council\u2019s transformations, never altering the original words except for the treatment of whispers between them. For instance, when a resident spoke the phrase \u201cExample,\u201d the transformed message would be identical, as there were no whispers to mark. If the request was \u201cExample 1\u201d (that is, with a gentle pause between words), the enchanted scroll would read \u201cExample_1,\u201d linking the thoughts with a single underscore. Should someone utter \u201c Example 2,\u201d with an opening pause, the result would be \u201c_Example_2.\u201d Most strikingly, presenting \u201c Example   3\u201d\u2014where a lone word was separated from its fellow with a dramatic, triple pause\u2014would yield \u201c_Example-3,\u201d with the opening pause marked and the long hush transformed to a dash.\n\nThus, the people of Verbatim ensured that all communication, both mundane and momentous, flowed according to the Council\u2019s two great rules of marking brief and protracted whispers with their appropriate signs. Through this ritual of conversion, ambiguity was banished, and every message retained its intended rhythm and separation.\n\nTo summarize the Council\u2019s ritual:  \n- When given a message as plain text, return a message in kind, where each gentle pause is shown with an underscore, while every cluster of three or more consecutive pauses becomes a dash in place of those pauses.  \n- For example, given:\n  - \u201cExample\u201d \u2192 \u201cExample\u201d\n  - \u201cExample 1\u201d \u2192 \u201cExample_1\u201d\n  - \u201c Example 2\u201d \u2192 \u201c_Example_2\u201d\n  - \u201c Example   3\u201d \u2192 \u201c_Example-3\u201d  \nIn each case above, the whispers are honored and transformed as per Verbatim\u2019s cherished tradition.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling digital city of Archivopolis, residents stored their treasured knowledge in enchanted vaults known as \"files.\" Every vault earned its place in the city only if it bore a proper inscription: a file name that passed the scrutiny of the vigilant Archivists' Council. Their directives were unwavering and arose from centuries of chaos, when poorly-named vaults led to lost secrets and broken spells.\n\nArchivopolis had established ancient laws\u2014rooted in both tradition and security\u2014about how each vault should be named. For one, the laws forbade a file name to parade more than three numerals through its characters, for numbers were seen as potent, and too many in one place sowed discord. Furthermore, a single period\u2014the punctuation etched as a dot\u2014must appear just once, distinguishing the vault's title from its mystical type. The words carved before this dot could never be blank, and to guarantee authenticity, they must begin with a noble letter from the Old Script, the latin alphabet known throughout land and ether alike. Last, but not least, only the most esteemed enchantments were allowed after the dot\u2014the words \u201ctxt,\u201d \u201cexe,\u201d or \u201cdll,\u201d for only these suffixes the great spellbooks of Archivopolis recognized.\n\nTo maintain order, the Council sent a message to all young apprentices: **Given a scroll with a sequence of runes** (that is, a string bearing a file\u2019s possible name), **return \u201cYes\u201d if the inscription passes all rules, or \u201cNo\u201d if it violates even one.** These apprentices were directed to draft their responses using a magical function, called `file_name_check`, which would receive the would-be file name (the string) and output either \u201cYes\u201d (admission to Archivopolis\u2019s vaults!) or \u201cNo\u201d (rejection and exile to the Null Lands).\n\nConsider, for example, the citizen \u201cexample.txt.\u201d This file name would earn immediate passage, for it bore just one dot, started with a true letter, had no offensive numbers, and proclaimed its type as \u201ctxt\u201d\u2014one of the city\u2019s honored suffixes. In contrast, \u201c1example.dll,\u201d while bearing a valid suffix and no extra dots or digits, faltered in the opening rite, for its initial sign was a number, not a letter\u2014casting itself into dishonor.\n\nThus, the law demanded: **Write a function that accepts a mystical string of runes as input, and, based on these time-honored rules, outputs \u201cYes\u201d if the name is pure, and \u201cNo\u201d otherwise.** When presenting your judgments, apprentices must show their work thusly:\n\n```\nprint(file_name_check(\"example.txt\"))   # Output: Yes\nprint(file_name_check(\"1example.dll\"))  # Output: No\n```\n\nHere, the Council provides the sacred explanations for their corollaries: the first inscription, \u201cexample.txt,\u201d passes all criteria, while the second, \u201c1example.dll,\u201d stumbles at the threshold due to its wayward beginning. Through this custom, Archivopolis remains ever vigilant, ensuring its secrets endure\u2014orderly, accessible, and preserved for all ages.",

        "question_content": "In the luminous city of Numeria, nestled within the realm of Algorithmia, a peculiar order governed the way numbers were handled for the grand annual Festival of Tallies. The city\u2019s inhabitants, known as the Listers, prided themselves on cataloguing sequences of numbers, with each sequence representing a proud family\u2019s numerical heritage. Yet, this year\u2019s festival had a twist: an ancient oracle had issued a decree, setting forth a challenge to process these number lists under a set of cleverly concealed rules.\n\nAccording to the oracle\u2019s decree, every list submitted by a Numerian must undergo a mystical transformation before its value could be judged. Each child in a Numerian household lined up to represent a family number, standing in a row. The city\u2019s tradition dictated that a child\u2019s place in line, beginning from the youngest at the front (whose position was counted as the very first in Numerian parlance), mattered greatly. If a child\u2019s position in the line was such that their count, while following the city\u2019s customary count starting from zero, was a multiple of the sacred Three, the family\u2019s number for that child would be taken and raised to an exalted square. However, should a child\u2019s place only honor the revered Four and not Three\u2014meaning their count in line was a multiple of Four, but not of Three\u2014the family\u2019s number would be lifted to the rarefied heights of the cube. All other numbers, belonging to children who stood at positions honoring neither Three nor only Four, would remain unaltered, as is Numerian custom.\n\nThe city\u2019s High Tallykeeper, seeking a champion, set forth the festival\u2019s quest: For any presented ancestral list, transform each number following these traditions, and then combine all the numbers, with the aim to make this summation as comprehensive as possible in accordance with Numerian law. The Tallykeeper specified how each family must present their list\u2014in Numerian script, a list of numbers is written within brackets, each entry separated by a comma. The final, glorious sum (a single integer), would then be announced to the festival audience. To win, residents must follow this tradition precisely: write a function that takes, as its offering, such a list, and produces the sum following Numerian magic.\n\nFor example, consider the proud family who stepped forward with a heritage of [1, 2, 3]. Positioning the children (with positions starting from zero), the first child (0) stood at a place blessed by both Three and Four, so their number was squared. The second and third children (positions 1 and 2) were at places of no special blessing, so their numbers remained unchanged. Summing these: one squared is one, plus two, plus three, for a final, festive sum of six. Another family, with no children, offered an empty sequence, thus yielding a sum of zero\u2014much to the amusement of the Numerian crowd. Consider then a family presenting [-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]; the transformations and summed result equaled negative one hundred and twenty-six, an unusual but valid Numerian outcome.\n\nThus, the Numerian code of tallying is clear: parade forth any list, transform its elements by the designated indices\u2014squaring those whose places are multiples of Three, cubing those whose places are multiples of Four but not Three, leaving all others untouched\u2014and sum the transformed list to present before the oracle. The city\u2019s mathematicians prized elegance and efficiency in these offerings, inspiring all to seek the most direct and faithful method\u2014without omission or embellishment.\n\nIn festival records, every solution was tested thus: a family submitting [1, 2, 3] received an announced sum of 6; a family with no members received 0; and the clan with [-1, -5, 2, -1, -5] was awarded -126. Young apprentices treasured these tales, repeating them as they learned the ways of transformation for future festivals, ensuring the wisdom of the oracle was never lost.\n\nAnd so, through this ritual, Numeria preserved the secret art of transmuting and combining numbers\u2014a narrative reminder that, sometimes, the place you stand matters just as much as the number you carry.",

        "question_content": "In the city of Lexiconia, language was not just a means of communication\u2014it was a living system, governed by ancient numerologists known as the Primal Scribes. These keepers believed that the true power of an utterance lay not in the words themselves, but in the secret strength of their lengths. Within Lexiconia, every spoken declaration\u2014a sentence\u2014was composed of words, and the citizens revered words whose length echoed the mysterious rules of prime numbers, that is, those with no positive divisors other than one and themselves.\n\nThe Primal Scribes were given a special challenge. They would receive a single utterance\u2014a string of words, each separated by a single space. As an unspoken citywide rule, every letter was written in proper alphabetical order, with no punctuation or digits sullying the lines. The length of each declaration stayed moderate, never exceeding one hundred runes in total, nor falling below a single rune. Within these bounds, the Scribes performed their silent task.\n\nThe purpose of the Scribes was precise: from any sentence handed to them, they must extract and repeat, in perfect original order, only those words whose very length was considered prime by the city\u2019s ancient mathematical tradition. To do this, they examined each word, counting its letters, and asked silently, \u201cIs this number one of the city\u2019s primes?\u201d If the answer was yes, the word was set aside to be recited anew; if not, the word slipped away into linguistic oblivion. The Scribes valued not the sum or the rarity, but rather the purity: a new phrase, rebuilt from only the most storied of primes, and no others, must appear as the answer.\n\nAny Scribe called upon to serve this duty did so in the following way: they awaited a single line\u2014a sentence, as the city defined it. They delivered, in return, a new strand, comprised solely of those prime-length words, leaving them in their original sequence and separated by a space. Those were the rules, as encoded in their ancient scrolls, and they never varied in their task.\n\nFor example, consider when Lira, the youngest Scribe, was handed the proclamation: **\"This is a test\"**. She observed each word\u2014\u201cThis\u201d (four letters), \u201cis\u201d (two letters), \u201ca\u201d (one letter), \u201ctest\u201d (four letters)\u2014but only \u201cis\u201d, with its two runes, belonged to the revered set of primes. Thus, Lira returned, simply, **\"is\"** to the Speaker, as her answer. On another day, confronted with **\"lets go for swimming\"**, she identified \u201cgo\u201d and \u201cfor\u201d (both two and three letters, respectively\u2014each a prime) as worthy, so she formed the answer **\"go for\"**.\n\nIn truth, these examples highlighted the city\u2019s ancient logic: submit a sentence of up to one hundred pure letters, and the Scribes would reply in kind. Should none of the words bear prime-lengths, they would merely fall silent. The magic of Lexiconia thus remained a living code, connecting numbers and language in every spoken phrase.",

        "question_content": "In the tranquil realm of Numeria, fractions were not just numbers, but living spirits divided into clans: the noble Numerators and the steadfast Denominators. For generations, the wise scholars of Numeria pondered a particular custom: when two fraction spirits formed a union\u2014by multiplying together\u2014could their joining ever birth a perfect Whole? Only when such a union produced a being with no remaining trace of the clans (that is, a whole number with no division between Numerator and Denominator) would the spirits rejoice, for this was considered the highest harmony.\n\nIn Numeria, each spirit\u2019s lineage was always spoken as \u201cA out of B\u201d\u2014for example, \u201cthree out of four\u201d meant a spirit with three parts of Numerator ancestry and four parts Denominator. Every spirit formed this way was valid and no Denominator had ever vanished into nothingness\u2014such blasphemy was forbidden by the laws of Numeria. The sages always presented the fractions in this format, ensuring both Numerator and Denominator were shining, indivisible positive numbers.\n\nNow, it was customary to pair spirits for the grand Festival of Multiplication. The union ceremony multiplied the Numerators of both spirits to form the new Numerator clan, and did the same with their Denominator clans. The question recurred with each ceremony: was it possible for the resulting spirit to represent a pure Whole, with no clan affiliation but itself? If so, the crowd cheered their most thunderous \u201cTrue!\u201d If the result still owed loyalty to the Denominator clan, a respectful \u201cFalse\u201d was recorded instead. The sages devised a special oracle, known as the function \u201csimplify,\u201d which could always divine the answer. The oracle\u2019s input was the pair of fraction spirits\u2014each as a string, like \"a/b\" for one and \"c/d\" for the other\u2014and, with mathematical intuition, the oracle would pronounce either \u201cTrue\u201d (if unity had been achieved) or \u201cFalse\u201d (if a split spirit remained).\n\nTo summon the oracle, the villagers would present the two spirits\u2019 lineages as described: each as \"numerator/denominator\" strings. The return was an honest verdict, written simply as either True or False\u2014independent of special language. For instance, presented with (\"1/5\", \"5/1\"), the oracle would declare True, for the spirits together formed a perfect whole. For (\"1/6\", \"2/1\"), it returned False, as their union could not shed all clan ties. If presented (\"7/10\", \"10/2\"), again, False was the verdict, as complexity persisted within the merged bloodlines.\n\nAnd so, the tale of Numeria\u2019s multiplication ceremonies was encoded for future generations: to check any union of two fraction spirits, express their ancestries as numerator/denominator strings, and seek the wisdom of \u201csimplify.\u201d Should their pairing ever be asked, the answer would come\u2014a perfect reflection of the spirits\u2019 harmony or their lingering division.\n\n**Input to the oracle:** Two spirit lineages, each as a string in the \"numerator/denominator\" form (such as \"1/5\" and \"5/1\").  \n**Output from the oracle:** Either True (if their union merges into a Whole) or False (if not).\n\n**Examples:**  \n- If the pair is (\"1/5\", \"5/1\"), the oracle returns True\u2014because their joining gives 1, a perfect Whole.  \n- If the pair is (\"1/6\", \"2/1\"), the oracle returns False\u2014because 1/3 is not a Whole spirit.  \n- If the pair is (\"7/10\", \"10/2\"), the oracle returns False\u2014because 7/2 is not indivisible.  \nThus, every festival, the oracle preserves the clarity of Numeria\u2019s ancient laws.",

However, the custom has one important nuance: if two or more citizens have the same Point Value, their place in line is determined by the order in which their invitations were received\u2014never by random chance.\n\nIt is a source of endless fascination for Numeralis scholars how these Point Values are calculated: by taking each digit of a citizen\u2019s number, ignoring any indication of origin (whether positive or negative), and simply summing the digits together. This means, for instance, that Citizen Number -11 has a Point Value of two, since one plus one leads to two, with the negative sign having no weight in this ritual.\n\nThe High Council of Numeralis now faces a challenge. For each gathering, a list is distributed that details the Citizen Numbers of those invited, in the order the invitations were sent. The council's task is to rearrange this list to comply with tradition: first by ascending Point Value, and then, when ties occur, preserving the original invitation order among citizens with identical scores. As the council values efficiency and clarity, they seek a function which, when provided the invitation list, returns a new list\u2014the permuted lineup for the parade.\n\nCitizens must communicate in a special council-approved way\u2014a scroll containing a sequence of numerals. For example, when the council presents the list [1, 11, -1, -11, -12], the outcome of their traditional ordering should be a new list: [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]. If, on a rare occasion, no invitations are sent, the function should quietly return an empty listing, honoring silence with silence, as in: [] \u2192 [].\n\nThe council thus tasks the wise function \u2018order_by_points\u2019 to take a list of Citizen Numbers\u2014presented in the form [number1, number2, ...]\u2014and return a newly arranged list per the sacred ordering. All outputs must respect Numeralis\u2019s traditions as described, ensuring clarity for any who read the register.\n\nTo illustrate the custom, let us reflect: given [1, 11, -1, -11, -12] as input, the citizens stand in this order at parade: [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]. Here, the first three all share a Point Value of one and two, respectively, yet their lineup honors the roll call order. When the list is empty, parade grounds remain undisturbed. Thus, the laws and logic of Numeralis maintain order, clarity, and tradition in every gathering.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling realm of Numeria, a land where numbers walk and talk, every citizen is known by their unique numeric name. Among these citizens, an ancient council is tasked with identifying the truly \u201cspecial\u201d ones\u2014those who stand out not just by being of uncommon magnitude, but also by the curious nature of their beginnings and endings.\n\nAccording to Numerian lore, a number only catches the council\u2019s eye if it boasts a value surpassing ten (a sign of maturity and experience in Numerian society). Yet, not just any mature number qualifies. In Numeria, the tradition of oddness holds great prestige; the council looks closely at the first and last digit of each citizen's name, seeking those who both begin and end on a note of oddity\u2014only the bravest numbers that start and finish with the proud digits one, three, five, seven, or nine are considered for recognition, regardless of being positive or negative. The council, guided by a strict code, ignores any number with an even first or last digit, or one with a value ten or less, as they are deemed too ordinary for this honor.\n\nThe heart of the council\u2019s proceedings lies in the \u201cspecialFilter\u201d ritual. During this ceremony, a scroll listing the names of Numerian citizens (numbers, arranged in any order and sometimes negative) is passed to the council. The ritual scrutinizes every name on the scroll, testing each against the rules: Is the absolute value above ten? Does the first digit and the last digit\u2014regardless of their sign\u2014belong to the sacred odd set? Only those who meet all these criteria are counted towards Numeria's tally of the extraordinary.\n\nThe task for any scribe or codemage seeking favor with the council is this: given a list of numbers (as an array), you must write out, in clear Numerian script, the count of names that satisfy these dual oddity rituals and cross the threshold of greatness (being strictly greater than ten in absolute value). Your standard format is as follows: the function \u201cspecialFilter\u201d takes in an array (the Numerian scroll), and must return a simple count (the tally) of those truly special numeric names. \n\nFor example, if the scroll reads: [15, -73, 14, -15], the wise council finds only one citizen, fifteen, who possesses the necessary magnitude and proudly begins and ends with an odd digit. Thus, the scribe writes:  \nspecialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1\n\nIn a different session, if the scroll is [33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109], the council deems the numbers thirty-three and forty-five as worthy; both surpass the required value and both their first and last digits ring with the echo of oddness. Here, the scribe records:  \nspecialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2\n\nTherefore, as a numerian storyteller or a visiting coder, your challenge is to faithfully enact the specialFilter ceremony, ensuring that each array of numbers is tested according to Numerian doctrine, with sample outcomes transcribed as befitting the ancient council\u2019s expectations.",

The method takes a list of numbers as input and returns the count of numbers that meet the specified conditions. The conditions are that the absolute value of the number is greater than 10 and the first and last digits of the number are odd. The method uses a set to store the odd digits for quick lookup. The count is incremented for each number that meets these conditions. The final count is then returned.\n",

        "question_content": "In the distant land of Numeria, mathematicians are held in the highest esteem, revered for their nightly puzzles that keep the kingdom\u2019s mind ever sharp. Each year, the royal librarian presents a set of mysterious glyphs\u2014ancient numbers etched onto tablets\u2014each inscribed with a single value. For a given number, always positive, the librarians create a line of mystical stones, their number matching the chosen value exactly. Upon each stone, an artisan-scrawl records a special number, calculated by a secret formula cherished since the first dynasty: the number inscribed upon any given stone is determined by taking its position in the row, squaring it, subtracting its position once, and then adding a single golden mark for luck.\n\nAmong the sacred orders in Numeria is a guild known as the Trigonists, famed for their celebration of harmonious trios. The Trigonists decree this challenge: from the line of mystical stones, one must select three unique stones in strict left-to-right sequence\u2014never skipping backwards\u2014such that the sum of their inscriptions resonates with a triple harmony, that is, the total must be divisible by the sacred number three. The value upon any stone cannot be referenced by chart or symbol; rather, it is always the result of the position\u2019s magic, which is to take the count of steps to reach that stone, square it, subtract the step count, and then add the lucky mark.\n\nThe task presented to clever apprentices each year is clear: given the original number of stones, discover and report how many harmonious trios can be formed\u2014those sets where the stones are chosen in ever-increasing position, and their totals ring true with a threefold chord, that is, those whose total is an exact multiple of the sacred number. The question is not simply whether this can be done, but to find every possible trio that meets this ancient harmony, never missing one, and never counting any arrangement not strictly left-to-right by stone placement.\n\nFor record-keeping, the guild requires a single number as response: the total count of such harmonious trios. Each apprentice, upon entering the chamber, is handed a scroll with the following directive: \u201cUpon receiving the Number (called *n*), report your answer as a single integer upon the following line. For example, if given *n* as five, the stones\u2019 numbers would list as one, three, seven, thirteen, and twenty-one. There is but one harmonious trio: the stones in first, third, and fourth places (numbers one, seven, and thirteen), for the sum of these three is twenty-one, a perfect triple.\u201d The format of both the apprentice's challenge and response is as follows: input is the single stone count, and output is the single answer, alone on a line.\n\nTo close, let us recall the trial with *n* set to five: the array of stone numbers crafted would be [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]. In this scenario, only one harmonious trio exists, where the total of the first, third, and fourth stones\u2014one plus seven plus thirteen\u2014equals twenty-one, a gleaming tribute to the Sacred Three. The royal scribe would thus record \u201c1\u201d upon the archway tablet as the official answer. As the apprentices disperse with new puzzles in hand, Numeria\u2019s mathematical magic lives on.",

        "question_content": "In the far reaches of the galaxy, astronomers of the Celestial Academy practiced a curious observance: they regarded the planets not just as wandering orbs, but as royal courts arrayed in stately sequence about the Sun\u2019s golden throne. There were eight such courts by ancient decree, each one\u2019s distance from the Sun meticulously chronicled in sacred star-charts. Mercury, the fleetest, held the position closest to the solar monarch; Venus, resplendent with clouds, followed next, trailed by Earth, Mars the crimson, mighty Jupiter, ringed Saturn, enigmatic Uranus, and lastly, the sapphire realm of Neptune.\n\nThe Star Registry prescribed a peculiar etiquette whenever an interplanetary festival was to be planned: if a student wished to invite the courts lying between those of two chosen rulers, they must carefully consult the cosmic order, neither omitting a worthy house nor summoning an unqualified one. Yet, the Sun decreed that only the houses strictly positioned between the two named courts\u2014closer to the Sun than one but farther than the other\u2014be invited, leaving out the hosts themselves. Any suggestion to include a house not recognized in the ancient sequence was met with silence; the Sun's wisdom tolerated no confusion.\n\nTo codify this ritual, the astronomers devised a tradition for summoning festival invitations: a scroll was to be brought forth bearing, as the first line, the names of the two planetary hosts presented as words. Should either name be mispronounced or sprouted from ignorance, the magic of the ceremony would sputter out, issuing only an empty flourish. Otherwise, the scroll would unfurl the names of all courts that resided within the bounds set by the designated hosts, always in the dignified sequence from closest to farthest from the Sun. In this way, all between-court festivities were organized with strict celestial protocol.\n\nThe stargazers established a clear convention for this ceremony: to submit two words, representing courtly names, as the ritual's invitation\u2014such as Jupiter paired with Neptune, or Mercury with Uranus. The Sun would then respond with a solemn listing, encased in round brackets and separated by commas, showcasing only those courts within the bounds\u2014never including the hosts themselves. When the ritual recognized an error\u2014say, an unlisted name or misremembered court\u2014the response would be uniquely empty, signaling the omission without reproach.\n\nLet us illuminate these proceedings with practical tales from the archives: When Jupiter and Neptune were chosen as hosts, the courts of Saturn and Uranus, lying between them, received the coveted invitation (\"Saturn\", \"Uranus\"). When Earth looked back to Mercury, Venus alone stood between, and so her dominion was announced (\"Venus\",). Similarly, from Mercury\u2019s proud outpost all the way to Uranus, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn received notification (\"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\"). But when an unrecognized name\u2014such as 'Pluto'\u2014was attempted, the galactic channels fell silent, yielding only an empty decree.\n\nThus, through the careful observation of order and tradition, each festival in the Celestial Academy unfolded in compliance with the cosmic sequence, honoring both invitations and continuity as the Sun's ancient law required.",

These artisans were charged with safeguarding the Sacred Registry\u2014a grand tome that catalogued all words brought by travelers and scribes from across the realms. Yet, not every word was fit for entry: the custodians of the Registry lived by the Law of Pairs, a tradition as ancient as the mountains themselves.\n\nThe Law of Pairs dictated that words of odd stature\u2014those whose lengths could not be evenly divided between two scribes\u2014were considered incomplete, unbalanced, and thus unworthy of preservation. Wordsmiths took it upon themselves to scan each new list of candidate words delivered to their hall, discarding any with an odd number of characters. The Registry\u2019s keepers prided themselves not only in the safeguarding of these words but perfected their craft to ensure that every word admitted stood in harmonious order: first, by their length from shortest to longest, and when competing in stature, alphabetically by their beginning.\n\nTravelers who wished their words to make a mark upon history would line before the Registry\u2019s judges, each presenting a scroll of hopeful entries. Each scroll, always containing only words and never numerical glyphs, sometimes bore repeated words\u2014an occurrence that caused no distress among the custodians, for duplicates were given respect equal to any original.\n\nThe ceremony of induction was precise: the Wordsmiths would review the entire roll, calmly removing every word that stood on an odd number of letters. They would then arrange the remaining words in ascending order by their measure. Where two or more words were of equal length, the local custom decreed that they be stacked in the Registry as they would appear in a ceremonial dance\u2014by the alphabet. Only when every word was in its proper place would they announce the official collection for that evening.\n\nWhen a visitor sought to know which words from their scroll would be honored, the lead Wordsmith would say, \u201cPresent me a list of words, written uniformly as strings, and I shall return a new list after following our sacred process. For example, if you enter the phrasebook with simply `['aa', 'a', 'aaa']`, we shall keep only those with even length\u2014yielding the list `['aa']`. Should you bring forth the scroll `['ab', 'a', 'aaa', 'cd']`, the Law of Pairs grants admittance to both `'ab'` and `'cd'`, and our esteemed custom would record them as `['ab', 'cd']`.\"\n\nAnd so, through ritual and logic, the Wordsmiths continued to maintain the Sacred Registry, their work a reminder that in Lexiconia, what mattered most was the lasting order and balance of the written word\u2014reflected caringly in each ceremony and in every answer they bestowed.",

The method takes a list of words as input and returns a new list that meets the following conditions:\n\n1. Each word in the list has an even number of characters.\n2. The words are sorted by length (in ascending order) and then alphabetically.\n\nThe code uses list comprehension to filter out words with an odd number of characters, and the `sort` method with a custom key function to sort the words.

The elders believe that every milestone is worth celebrating, from the very first step to whatever summit is set by the child\u2019s ambition.\n\nThe Counting Path ritual follows a series of customs. Each participant chooses a number, which the Numerians call the Limit. This Limit is always a whole number, and symbolizes how far the child wishes to journey during their recitation. The rules of Numeria are precise: the child must begin their recitation by uttering the ancient symbol of nothingness, which is \u201czero,\u201d and then continue, one by one, through every next number, each separated by a brief pause, until they reach their chosen Limit. No number between the starting point and the Limit may be skipped, and the sequence must be spoken in order, as if traversing stepping stones lined up in a row.\n\nThe elders specify exactly how this ritual is to be conducted. When a child presents themselves, the assembly records a single number: the child\u2019s chosen Limit. In the ceremonial ledger, this is written on a line by itself, signifying the child\u2019s intent. The required response is equally precise: the recorder must then inscribe a single line containing all numbers from zero up to and including the Limit, each separated by a space, forming a single uninterrupted strand of numerals.\n\nFor example, consider a young Numerian who selects the Limit as zero, perhaps eager to mark only the beginning of their journey. The assembly would record the number zero, and expect to hear and see only \u201czero\u201d in return. Should another bold child choose to go as high as five, the ritual demands that the response be a proud, unbroken recitation: \u201czero one two three four five,\u201d each word carefully spoken and spaced.\n\nThus, the ceremony challenges each participant to recount their journey from nothing to their chosen Limit, neither missing a single step nor extending beyond their ambition. The task, therefore, is to provide as complete and efficient a recitation as possible, fulfilling the tradition\u2019s requirements without excess or omission.\n\nTo clarify with examples from recent ceremonies:  \n- If the ledger\u2019s input is:  \n  `0`  \n  Then the response must be:  \n  `0`  \n- For an input of:  \n  `5`  \n  The response must be:  \n  `0 1 2 3 4 5`  \nThese forms precisely match the ritual\u2019s expectations, honoring both tradition and the path each child has chosen to walk.",

Among the most important rituals of Numeria\u2019s festival of Selection was a test imbued with ancient mathematical magic. The mystics of Numeria believed that certain numbers\u2014those indivisible and mysterious, known locally as the \u201cPrime Spirits\u201d\u2014held a special power over destiny.\n\nEach year, three tokens would be presented to the Oracle: one bearing a number to be judged, and the other two representing possible blessings or boons. The Oracle, renowned for her wisdom and her adherence to the ancient laws, was tasked with a simple yet meaningful choice. If the number brought before her was blessed by the Prime Spirits\u2014meaning it could not be divided evenly by any lesser whole (except itself and unity)\u2014then she would bestow upon the petitioner the first boon. Otherwise, if the number was common and could be broken into exact portions by numbers other than itself and unity, the Oracle would grant them the second boon.\n\nThe ritual conducted by the Oracle could be described as follows: she would be handed three scrolls. The first scroll contained the number to be tested by the spirits; the second revealed the first boon, which would be granted if the Prime Spirits smiled upon the petitioner; the third bore the alternative boon, for when the Prime Spirits found the number undeserving. The Oracle\u2019s role was not only to complete the ritual according to these celestial rules, but to do so with unwavering efficiency\u2014never dithering, always choosing precisely as the spirits decreed.\n\nTo formalize the ritual in Numeria's archives, the keepers of knowledge offered this instruction: when making a supplication to the Oracle, present three offerings (written as three numbers on a single line, separated by spaces). The Oracle\u2019s response\u2014a single number\u2014would be the chosen boon, appearing on its own line. For example, if a petitioner pleaded with the number seven, offering blessings of thirty-four and twelve, the Oracle would consult the spirits: seven is beloved by the Prime Spirits, so the answer would be thirty-four. However, if fifteen was the number in question, with boons eight and five, she would instead declare five, since fifteen is too ordinary for the Prime Spirits\u2019 grace.\n\nTo illuminate the process, the archives include examples:  \n**Input:** `7 34 12`   \n**Output:** `34`  \nFor this, since seven is a number honored by the Prime Spirits, the Oracle\u2019s answer is the first boon.  \n**Input:** `15 8 5`  \n**Output:** `5`  \nHere, fifteen fails the Prime Spirits' test, so the second boon is bestowed.\n\nSo unfolds the ceremony in Numeria\u2014a land where the primal mysteries of succession and division decide destinies, and wise petitioners always know which boon to place their hopes upon.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeria, there existed a revered society of Arcane Calculators, entrusted with the task of harnessing the mystical powers hidden within collections of enchanted stones. These stones, gathered from every corner of the city, each bore a number, some whole and pristine, others fractured or tarnished by darkness. The wise ones discovered that only the stones whose number-carvings were both unbroken (that is, non-negative and without fractions) and bearing the peculiar mark of the odd (an ancient Numerian trait) contained true magical potential.\n\nThe city\u2019s governing scrolls outlined strict traditions for the Calculators: First, only stones whose number-marks were whole and unmarred by negativity were to be considered\u2014the broken or darkened stones held no usable energy. Second, the stones needed the elusive \u201codd radiance,\u201d a property only possessed by those with their number-mark not evenly dividable into pairs. At every High Casting, the society would carefully examine all stones in a collection, discarding all that failed these tests.\n\nFor each worthy stone, upon the sacred square altar, their number would be doubled back upon itself\u2014a ceremonial squaring, a Numerian tradition believed to amplify energy. These squared energies would then be gathered into a grand sum, representing the total magical current that the Calculators could channel that day. The ultimate goal for the Arcane Calculators was clear: from any collection brought forth, extract the sum of all magical energies after squaring the numbers of the stones that passed the society\u2019s rigorous criteria, with maximum efficiency\u2014in Numeria, wasting effort was a grave taboo.\n\nIn terms of the scrolls, citizens would present the Arcane Calculators with their offering, a list of number-marks attached to their stones, requesting: \u201cWhat total energy may these stones provide?\u201d To answer, the Calculators required the input as a procession of number-marks. In return, they would output a single number\u2014the combined sum of magnified energies from the odd, whole, unshadowed stones alone.\n\nTo make these methods clear to even the youngest apprentice, the head Calculator offered examples from past ceremonies: If a citizen arrived bearing stones marked one, three, two, and zero, only the first two offered power, as their symbols were whole, non-negative, and odd; their energies were squared and summed\u2014one and nine\u2014yielding a total of ten. Should a visitor bring only broken or negative stones, such as negative one, negative two, or zero (which, though whole and non-negative, was not odd), the society would declare the day powerless: the total was zero. Sometimes, a single powerful stone arrived\u2014such as one with a mark of nine. Since nine was both whole, positive, and odd, its energy squared would yield eighty-one, and that was the day\u2019s sum. When presented with nothing but a lone stone marked zero, the result, too, was an energyless void, a sum of zero. If a citizen brought no stones at all, the Calculators would intone zero, honoring the tradition.\n\nThus, the Arcane Calculators\u2019 ceremony, mirrored in their legendary function double_the_difference, always produced, from any list of stones\u2019 markings, the sum drawn from squaring the values of the odd, unbroken stones alone. A city forever in pursuit of their unique sum, their magical legacy preserved through ritual, number, and careful selection.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling kingdom of Prognosia, there existed an age-old festival celebrated by all: the Festival of Fateful Outcomes. Each year, a grand series of contests\u2014let us call them matches\u2014would be held in the central arena, eagerly viewed by the entire populace. For every contest, townsfolk would gather in anticipation, making their best predictions as to which champions would emerge victorious and with what scores. These predictions weren\u2019t just idle fancies; they were meticulously recorded in ledgers, side-by-side with the actual outcomes once the festival ended.\n\nAncient tradition required that for every such festival, two scrolls would be presented to the Overseer of Outcomes. The first scroll bore the true tapestry of results, inscribed by the Judges themselves, recounting the fate of each match in the order they were fought. The second scroll carried the dreams and expectations of a hopeful predictor, their guesses etched for each contest, perfectly lined up to correspond with the results of the matches.\n\nIt was the solemn duty of the festival scribe to lay these two scrolls side-by-side and, for every match, discern the chasm or harmony between truth and expectation. Should a soothsayer\u2019s guess for a match align perfectly with the actual score, it would be recorded as a perfect foretelling\u2014no rift between reality and hope, and thus a value of zero. For every mismatch in the scrolls, the scribe would measure the gulf between guess and reality, noting down the precise magnitude by which vision diverged from fact. This \u201cdistance\u201d was always counted positively, with no regard for whose imagination soared higher or lower.\n\nTo preserve the findings, the scribe would transcribe a new ledger\u2014a written array\u2014where each entry referred to a contest in the original order. If there were N matches, then the resulting ledger too would contain N values, each representing the predictor\u2019s accuracy (zero for a perfect guess, an exact count for the degree of error otherwise). These entries became part of the chronicle, commensurate in length to the festival itself.\n\nLet us see this in practice. Imagine the Judges\u2019 scroll recorded the outcomes as: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], and the predictor\u2019s hopes were [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2]. The scribe\u2019s new accuracy ledger would read: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3], as for the first four contests, truths and dreams matched precisely, but for the last two, the error was three in each case. In another festival, outcomes may be told as [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4], with hopeful guesses of [4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2]; here, the resulting ledger would read [4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6], reflecting the measurement of hope\u2019s deviation from reality at each contest.\n\nAnd so, in Prognosia, to honor the dance between what might be and what truly was, each festival closed with the careful tallying of these ledgers. The kingdom preserved them for posterity, that all may learn the delicate art of closing the gap between dreams and destiny.\n\n**Input for the scribe**: two scrolls, each an array (a list, in the language of far-off lands of logic), each equally long, one bearing the festival\u2019s results, the other the predictor\u2019s guesses.  \n**Output**: an array of the same length, where each entry is zero when guess and reality align, or otherwise is the size of their difference.  \n**Examples in Prognosia\u2019s Chronicle:**\n\n- When given [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] and [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2], the accuracy ledger reads [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3].\n- When given [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4] and [4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2], the ledger reads [4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6].\n\nThus was fulfilled the scribe\u2019s sacred work, ensuring that every festival could end with a clear record of hope\u2019s proximity to fate in the great annals of Prognosia.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Codelia, every Academy fosters a proud tradition: each year, they unveil new Societies\u2014distinct groups with their own names and customs. But the heart of the celebration lies in the Academy\u2019s annual Expansion Festival, where each Society chooses to strengthen itself by uniting with Extensions, talented guilds hailing from every corner of the land. These Extensions bring their own names, powers, and reputations, and the bond between a Society and its strongest Extension is forged in the public eye.\n\nEvery Extension\u2019s strength is determined by a secret calculation revered across Codelia. Elder Scribes count the number of letters in an Extension's name that soar tall and proud (uppercase letters) and subtract the total of those that stand quietly humble (lowercase letters). The result\u2014whether noble, neutral, or negative\u2014marks the Extension\u2019s true worth. The greater this final number, the mightier the Extension. If two Extensions achieve identical might, tradition dictates that the earliest one to arrive at the Academy\u2019s gates is shown favor.\n\nThe festival\u2019s goal is clear: the Society must seek out and form a legendary duo with the strongest available Extension, declaring this powerful fusion to the world by announcing the united name in the format: SocietyName.StrongestExtensionName. The judges record their findings this way for clarity and honor. All Societies must follow this exact ritual when submitting their choices; their inputs are the Society\u2019s name (one string, always called first), followed by a list containing the names of the competing Extensions (a list of strings). The outcome is a single string, forming the union: SocietyName.ExtensionName.\n\nTo guide next year\u2019s celebrants, the Grand Archivist shares a pair of tales. In one, the \u201cSlices\u201d Society weighs its options among SErviNGSliCes, Cheese, and StuFfed. The Elders tally their scores: SErviNGSliCes stands at minus one, Cheese at minus five, and StuFfed at minus four. SErviNGSliCes is celebrated as the strongest, so \u201cSlices.SErviNGSliCes\u201d is recorded in the Festival\u2019s great ledger. In another example, the Society known as \u201cmy_class\u201d welcomes AA, Be, and CC. AA and CC each boast boldness of two, standing above Be\u2019s balanced count, and since AA arrived first, \u201cmy_class.AA\u201d is enshrined as that year\u2019s champion pairing.\n\nLet this tale serve as the living code of the Expansion Festival: bring forth a Society\u2019s name and a gathering of Extension names, discover which Extension carries the highest strength, and announce, in the honored format, the name of the Society bound to its mightiest Extension. Should a tie arise, the early bird always gains the worm. The wise can consult these chronicles for future festivals, ensuring each Society and Extension receives their due glory.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling kingdom of Lexicora, two powerful guilds governed the land: the Guild of Scrolls and the Guild of Cipher. The Scrolls prided themselves on their vast, beautifully written parchments containing every manner of tale, spell, and wisdom. The Ciphers were masters of patterns\u2014each member bore a unique token carved with mysterious symbols, the arrangement of which signified their lineage and power. These tokens were special: though they could be turned in any order by magical means, their meaning remained the same\u2014a tribute to the enigma of cyclical order.\n\nIt was common knowledge in Lexicora that, whenever a Cipher sought the wisdom of the Scrolls, their token had to be recognized within a scroll itself\u2014sometimes not in its original form, but in any of the magical configurations made possible by rotating the order of symbols on the token. Such rotations could move any number of symbols from the start to the end, one after another, spinning possibilities like a wheel until all options were uncovered. If any configuration of a Cipher\u2019s token could be found nestled, without interruption, anywhere within the text of the Scroll, then the Cipher would be granted access to that scroll\u2019s secret.\n\nThe challenge for all Ciphers was thus: upon being handed a particular scroll and a token, determine if the token\u2014or any rotated version of it\u2014could be flawlessly located somewhere inside the scroll\u2019s length. The quest was to answer, with certainty, whether this access could be achieved at least once. Every Cipher pursued this knowledge as efficiently as possible\u2014never letting a scroll go unexamined if potential entrance awaited.\n\nWhen presented with tokens and scrolls, the Guilds followed a format of inquiry and judgment. The scroll\u2019s script was offered first, followed by the configuration of the Cipher\u2019s token. The answer was a single word: \"True\" if at least one rotation of the token was present intact within the scroll; otherwise, \"False.\" For example, the formal inquiry might look like this:  \ncycpattern_check(\"hello\",\"ell\")  \nTo which the ruling would return: True.\n\nConsider these legendary exchanges, passed down in Lexicora\u2019s annals:\n- When the Scroll \u201cabcd\u201d faced the Token \u201cabd,\u201d the judges found no matching string in any rotation, and so the answer: False.\n- Presented \u201chello\u201d and \u201cell,\u201d the rotation \u201cell\u201d itself nestled right inside the scroll, yielding True.\n- With \u201cwhassup\u201d and \u201cpsus,\u201d none of psus, susp, usps, or spsu could be found in the scroll, resulting in False.\n- For \u201cabab\u201d and \u201cbaa,\u201d the token's rotation \u201caba\u201d was found inside the scroll (since \u201cbaa\u201d can be rotated to \u201caab\u201d or \u201caba\u201d), and thus, True.\n- \u201cefef\u201d and \u201ceeff\u201d: no rotation formed a proper substring inside the scroll, so the answer was False.\n- When challenged with \u201chimenss\u201d and the token \u201csimen,\u201d rotating the token to \u201cimens\u201d provided a match within the scroll, so the judges declared: True.\n\nThus, with every Cipher\u2019s quest, Lexicora furthered its reputation as a land where patterns met prose, and cleverness was rewarded with knowledge. The scrolls and tokens, matched or denied, decided many fates, all hinging upon the mysterious power of cycled tokens and the secrets they could unlock within a scroll\u2019s embrace.",

This is because in the worst case scenario, we might have to rotate the second string m times and for each rotation, we are checking if it exists in the first string.

These Digits, sometimes preceded by a mysterious shadow (which the wise ones call 'minus'), have great significance, for they possess hidden attributes\u2014some shine with cool, silvery light and are called Even, while others glow warm and golden, earning them the title of Odd. The future rulers of Numeria must carefully evaluate the balance of these Even and Odd essences within any given amulet.\n\nTo maintain fair governance, the Numerian Council has established a tradition: Should a visitor arrive at the gates, the Council must swiftly count the number of Even and Odd Digits in the newcomer's amulet, ignoring any shadows that simply linger at the start. The final tally\u2014first the count of Even, then Odd\u2014must be presented as a pair within a sturdy tuple-box, ensuring clarity and harmony in record-keeping.\n\nThe Council\u2019s herald explains the protocol to all new clerks: \u201cWhen a citizen presents their amulet, you must examine each individual Digit\u2014paying no heed if there is a shadow at the outset\u2014and discern which are Even and which are Odd. Once complete, the total number of Even Digits should be spoken first, followed by the sum of Odd ones. Seal both numbers within a tuple-shaped carrier for delivery.\u201d\n\nShould a scribe receive an inquiry about this process, the expected form of the answer is clear: the glowing integer sequence upon the amulet (possibly negative), presented as a single integer argument; the reply, a tuple carrying two numbers, the first representing the Even count and the second, the Odd. For instance, if someone brings forth an amulet marked with minus one-two (interpreted as the shadowed digits: 1 and 2), the record should state (1, 1)\u2014for there is one Even (the 2), and one Odd (the 1). For a sequence such as one-two-three, the answer becomes (1, 2): the 2 is Even, while 1 and 3 are Odd.\n\nSo the next time a Numerian approaches with their enchanted amulet, just recall this ritual: **look past the shadows, count each Even and Odd Digit within, and present the numbers as a tuple**. Whether the amulet reads -12 or 123, the council expects results in the format:  \n- `even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)`\n- `even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)`\n\nThus, the tale of the Even and Odd Digits continues, ensuring balance and order for all who reside under the ever-watchful gaze of Numeria\u2019s magical numerals.",

        "question_content": "Long ago, in the ancient city of Minima Roma, townsfolk cherished their own special tradition for recording tallies, debts, and victories: the sacred Roman cipher. But unlike the greater cities, where numbers were carved in proud, imposing capitals, Minima Roma\u2019s scholars penned all their numerals in gentle, delicate lowercase letters, a mark of humble wisdom passed down through generations. Every ledger, mural, and letter bore these subtle runes\u2014only those who knew the cipher\u2019s language could read the city\u2019s tales and secrets.\n\nNow, within the city\u2019s grand library, there lay a marvelous tome\u2014one that could turn any number offered to it into the city\u2019s cherished cipher. However, the tome only accepted whole, positive numbers\u2014never less than the first blessing, and never more than a thousand coins. Each time a visitor uttered their chosen count, the tome would translate it to its ancient sequence: \"i\" for one, \"v\" for five, \"x\" for ten, \"l\" for fifty, \"c\" for a hundred, \"d\" for five hundred, and finally, \"m\" for a thousand, always arranging the script just as tradition demanded. And as all things in Minima Roma, the outcome was always in gentle lowercase script.\n\nThe goal of this grand tome\u2019s keepers, then, was clear: Whenever a visitor presented a number within the city\u2019s accepted bounds, the transformation had to be precise\u2014rendered flawlessly following the cipher's rules, and expressed wholly in lowercase. Each transformation was to be completed swiftly, without error or omission, embodying both the heart and cleverness of Minima Roma.\n\nTo aid those who wished to harness the tome\u2019s powers outside the city, the scholars described the ritual in the following terms: When a traveler brings a single whole number upon entering the ritual chamber (the function\u2019s **input**), the tome should inscribe its lowercase cipher on a scroll (**output**) for the traveler to take. All numbers offered must be no less than one and no greater than a thousand\u2014should anyone bring a lesser or greater number, the tome would simply ignore their request.\n\nTo teach eager apprentices, the keepers kept a collection of records, showing how the tome might answer different calls. For example, should a visitor utter the count of nineteen, the tome would softly scribe \"xix\" upon the parchment. When another called out one hundred fifty-two, the scroll would be marked \"clii\". And if a merchant wished to commemorate four hundred twenty-six grain sacks, the answer would be \"cdxxvi\" in the beloved lowercase form.\n\nAnd so, the tradition thrived\u2014visitors offering numbers within the sacred range, transformed by the library\u2019s grandeur, carrying away the gentle wisdom of Minima Roma in every scroll: a cipher both enigmatic and elegantly simple for all who sought to translate their fortunes and fates.",

The program first checks if the input number is within the accepted range (1 to 1000). If it's not, it returns an empty string.

        "question_content": "In the ancient realm of Trigonalia, mathematicians were revered as mystics, each working in service to the kingdom\u2019s Great Geometer. The Geometer\u2019s court was teeming with those who marveled at the mysteries of shapes and forms, but none were so famous as the guild known as the Triangular Council. Their most celebrated ritual was the \u201cJudgment of Rightness,\u201d which determined whether any three rods\u2014perfectly straight and of distinct lengths\u2014could be assembled to form a sacred figure known throughout the lands: the Right-Angled Triangle.\n\nAt the heart of their process lay three rods, each with a length chosen by those seeking to prove themselves worthy architects or builders. The council decreed that a triangle could be constructed only if the lengths could lie together, with the sum of the two shorter rods' lengths always surpassing that of the longest one. But to bestow the blessing of the \u201cright angle\u201d\u2014that rare and precious corner forming a perfect square out of two joined rods\u2014the council would search for more: the sacred balance. They would compare the combined square measures of the two shorter rods to the square of the longest. Should these two sums align precisely, it was the legendary right-angled triangle.\n\nAny champion seeking the Geometer\u2019s verdict would perform a ceremonial inquiry. They would present the three chosen lengths (let us call them the first, second, and third rods) to the Council\u2019s scribe, who was trained to record questions precisely. For each inquiry, these lengths were whispered into a ceremonial scroll\u2014always in the format of three numbers, one after the other, each number denoting the length of a rod. In response, the Council would rush to the Sacred Table and, following ancient logic, pronounce \u201cTrue\u201d if a right-angle triangle could be formed, or \u201cFalse\u201d if the dance of lengths fell short.\n\nFor instance, a humble carpenter once offered rods of three, four, and five units in length. The council, using their invariable procedure\u2014testing if any ordering of these rods satisfied the rightness balance, with (3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 5\u00b2) in this case\u2014declared with utmost certainty: \u201cTrue.\u201d The people cheered. But another time, a curious scholar proposed rods of one, two, and three units. The council, after due inspection, announced: \u201cFalse,\u201d for a triangle with these rods could not even exist, let alone one bearing a right angle.\n\nThus, whenever aspirants from across Trigonalia wished to know, they would submit their triad in the prescribed manner\u2014three numbers spoken in a line\u2014and the Council would respond instantly. If the rods could be joined as a right-angled triangle, the answer was \u201cTrue\u201d; otherwise, \u201cFalse.\u201d In summary, the ritual is invoked thus:\n- Input: Three integers, each denoting a rod\u2019s length, placed in order upon the query scroll.\n- Output: A single verdict\u2014either \u201cTrue\u201d or \u201cFalse\u201d\u2014spoken in response.\n\nTo close with the wisdom of the ancients:  \nFor the entry \u201c3 4 5,\u201d the Council declared \u201cTrue,\u201d for these rods form the most celebrated right-angled triangle in all the land. For \u201c1 2 3,\u201d the answer was \u201cFalse,\u201d for such rods could never bind to yield a triangle, let alone one with a sacred angle of rightness. Thus, by the laws of Trigonalia, the test for the right-angled triangle endures through the ages, simple yet profound.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Lexicoria, there exists a legendary contest held in the Grand Hall of Letters. Here, every year, wordsmiths gather to present their most enchanting runes\u2014words they have forged with care from the alphabet\u2019s celestial flames. Each rune is judged not just on beauty or length, but on a particular and curious measure: the diversity of its magic, or in mundane tongue, the number of distinct symbols it contains.\n\nThe High Council of Lexicoria is strict in its judgment. Each participant may present exactly one rune, and all entries must be distinct across the contenders. The Council does not care for similar tricks repeated\u2014they seek only the richest spells, those boasting the highest count of unique symbols inscribed upon their surface. And, should two or more contestants present runes of equal brilliance (that is, equal in the number of unique glyphs they showcase), the winner is declared by the ancient scrolls of lexicographic order\u2014the word that would be first in a grand alphabetical register claims the Laurels.\n\nYour role, as the chronicler for the Council, is to design a ritual\u2014an enchanted function\u2014that, when handed a list of these words, will faithfully declare the victor. The procedure accepts, as a tribute, a series of runes laid out as a single scroll (specifically, a list of word-strings). It must return, with unwavering certainty, the rune that shines with the widest magical variety. If the contest must be settled by the scrolls of order, the one standing foremost in this arcane listing wins. The input is always a list, and the output is always a single word from the list\u2014the championship rune.\n\nFor clarification, let us walk through some trials from recent tournaments. In one instance, wordsmiths presented the runes: \u201cname,\u201d \u201cof,\u201d and \u201cstring.\u201d Here, \u201cstring\u201d dazzled with its kaleidoscope of six distinct glyphs, outshining the others and claiming the golden mantle. In another, three runes faced off: \u201cname,\u201d \u201cenam,\u201d and \u201cgame.\u201d All boasted four unique symbols, but \u201cenam\u201d arrived first in the storied register, so she was crowned. Sometimes, a rune appears with great repetition\u2014seven identical letters, say. When judged against other contenders with lesser variety, this oft-repeated enchantment still claims the day, owing to its singular but unwavering glyph.\n\nFor such tales, the function you must invoke is styled as follows: **find_max(words)**, where the words arrive in a list, as offered by the wordsmiths. The response is singular: the name of the champion rune, recorded as a string. For clarity, the invocations and proclamations might look thus:\n\n- When words are **[\u201cname\u201d, \u201cof\u201d, \u201cstring\u201d]**, the champion is **\u201cstring\u201d**.\n- When words are **[\u201cname\u201d, \u201cenam\u201d, \u201cgame\u201d]**, the laurels go to **\u201cenam\u201d**.\n- When words are **[\u201caaaaaaa\u201d, \u201cbb\u201d, \u201ccc\u201d]**, the winner is **\u201caaaaaaa\u201d**.\n\nIn this way, the rules of Lexicoria\u2019s Grand Hall are honored, and the mightiest rune\u2014by measure of diversity and by the scrolls of order\u2014ascends to legend.",

It uses the `max` function with the `key` parameter set to a lambda function that returns the number of unique characters in each word.

        "question_content": "In the heart of Golden Meadow, a clever little rabbit named Thistle made a daily ritual of feasting upon crunchy carrots. Thistle, like all rabbits in the Meadow, tracked her feast carefully, for the ancient laws of the Burrow decreed that only a prescribed number of carrots could be taken each day, ensuring the wellbeing of their lush land. Every morning, Thistle tallied how many carrots she had already enjoyed, carefully counted how many her tummy still rumbled for, and peered into the carrot cellar to see how many treasures still awaited beneath the soil.\n\nTo uphold the laws of Golden Meadow, Thistle and her friends abided by three simple but unbreakable customs. First, no rabbit could record a record of feasting or longing beyond the number one thousand\u2014such was the granary\u2019s log and the Meadow\u2019s bounty. Next, a rabbit might begin the day with any number of carrots already munched, might desire to chomp any number more, and could find any number left in the cellar, but only if each of these counts remained between zero and the sacred one thousand. \n\nNow, Thistle\u2019s goal each day was to satisfy her hunger as fully as possible but always respect the Meadow\u2019s balance. If the cellar contained enough crunchy carrots to sate her current craving, Thistle would eat exactly as many as she needed, then scurry away, leaving the proper number for future feasts. If, however, her longing outpaced the carrots in the cellar, Thistle would nibble every last one, her meal unfinished, but her respect for the rules unbroken. At the close of her meal, Thistle would update her carrot log: the total munched that day, and the count left beneath the soil.\n\nShould you wish to recount Thistle\u2019s tale in Meadow records, you would do so in the ancient language of the rabbits: provide three numbers. The first represents how many carrots have already been eaten, the second reflects how many more are needed, and the third reveals the current carrot stock. Upon processing, the carrot clerks would respond with a pair: the total number of carrots eaten after the meal, and the number remaining in the cellar. For example, the message `[number eaten, number needed, number in cellar]`\u2014like `[5, 6, 10]`\u2014would produce a response `[11, 4]`, meaning Thistle ate six more, achieved her full meal, and left four behind.\n\nLet us recount some tales from the meadow:\n- On one sunny day, Thistle started having eaten five carrots, yearned for six more, and eyed ten in the cellar. She munched six, then hopped off, leaving four untouched: thus `[5, 6, 10]` yields `[11, 4]`.\n- Another day, she\u2019d enjoyed four carrots, hungered for eight, but only nine grew. She nibbled eight, left one, and matched her perfect meal: `[4, 8, 9]` brings `[12, 1]`.\n- On a lean dawn, with only two munched, eleven needed, but a mere five left, Thistle devoured them all, but still longed for more; none remained for the morrow: `[2, 11, 5]` returns `[7, 0]`.\n- Should the carrots suffice exactly, as in `[1, 10, 10]`, she could sate her hunger fully, eating all ten and leaving none: the answer is `[11, 0]`.\n\nAnd so, Thistle\u2019s tale is one of harmony and satisfaction pursued as fully as fate\u2014and the carrot patch\u2014allows. Each day ends with a careful tally, a grateful heart, and the hope that tomorrow the carrots will be plentiful once again.",

If so, Thistle eats all the remaining carrots and sets the number of carrots needed to be the difference between the number of carrots needed and the number of carrots remaining. If the number of carrots needed does not exceed the number of carrots remaining, Thistle eats the number of carrots needed and subtracts it from the number of carrots remaining.\n\nThen, the solution calculates the number of carrots left in the cellar by taking the modulus of the number of carrots eaten by 1000. This gives the number of carrots left in the cellar. The number of carrots eaten is then divided by 1000 and multiplied by 1000 to get the number of carrots eaten in the thousands.\n\nFinally, the solution returns a list containing the number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left in the cellar.\n",

This guild prided itself on decoding the secret identities hidden within mystical scrolls\u2014scrolls that, at first glance, seemed to be mere streams of symbols. Yet, the true art was in discerning how many unique personas (characters) dwelled within each scroll, for some symbols, though dressed differently (in upper or lower garments), were truly the same entity beneath.\n\nThe Master of the Guild decreed a set of rules to all apprentices: When presented with a scroll, one must unravel all the symbols it bears. But heed this wisdom! The difference between an ornate uppercase and a humble lowercase was but a change of attire; if two symbols shared the same core, they were to be counted as one and the same. For example, a proud 'X' and a modest 'x' both belonged to the same lineage and could not be counted twice.\n\nThe challenge bestowed upon each apprentice was clear: For every scroll delivered to the guild, determine the number of unique personas within, treating those who merely wore different clothing as a single soul. The guild sought not mere approximation, but the most precise count possible\u2014no double-counting, no omissions.\n\nWhen a new scroll arrived, it would be presented as a single continuous sequence of symbols, the so-called *input*. The apprentice\u2019s response, written in a ledger, would be a single number representing the count of unique personas within that scroll\u2014the *output*. Should there be multiple scrolls to decipher, each answer was to be recorded on its own line, following the order in which the scrolls arrived.\n\nTo aid the apprentices, the Master provided examples transcribed from the ancient tomes. In one such tale, the scroll bore the inscription \u2018xyzXYZ\u2019. Despite the apparent variety, the apprentices knew that \u2018x\u2019, \u2018y\u2019, and \u2018z\u2019, regardless of their regalia, represented only three distinct personas. Thus, the answer was three. In another scroll, the name \u2018Jerry\u2019 appeared. Here, \u2018j\u2019, \u2018e\u2019, \u2018r\u2019, and \u2018y\u2019 were each unique, so the answer inscribed was four.\n\nAnd so, the Order of Letters continued their quest\u2014decoding, revealing, and tallying the secret identities hidden within every script, ensuring that no matter the guise, every unique soul was faithfully counted.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling heart of Numeria, a city famed for its mathematical marvels, the Algebrans competed in games of wit and calculation. Among them was an ancient tradition known as the Sequence Duel, where participants wielded powerful operation sigils and precious number stones. Each duelist, upon entering the arena, was handed a sequence of number stones (the operand stones), each inscribed with a non-negative value, and a matching set of operation sigils for all but one of the stones\u2014a tradition rooted in the belief that every operation should connect exactly two stones, and thus there must always be one fewer sigil than there are stones.\n\nThe rules of the Sequence Duel were written in golden script on the arena walls. The sigils allowed only five arcane manipulations: the Shield of Addition, the Blade of Subtraction, the Hammer of Multiplication, the Scepter of Floor Division (which, by decree, would always round down any result after dividing), and the Bolt of Exponentiation, which unleashed powers beyond mere multiplication. Duelists were reminded, \u201cYou must begin at the first stone and bind the next one using the first sigil, then continue, weaving stone after stone through the chain of sigils, left to right, never skipping nor changing the order. The wisdom of the ancients forbade length mismatch: one fewer sigils than stones, always.\u201d\n\nTo claim victory, a duelist had to combine all their stones into a single result by wielding their sigils in order\u2014no deviations, no hidden tricks. The duel was not just about following rules, but about doing so to the end, binding every stone as efficiently and effectively as possible by the prescribed magical process. In each duel, the sigils and stones were announced, and the outcome of their binding was broadcast throughout Numeria, so all could marvel at the cleverness of algebra.\n\nTo enter such a duel, a Summoner would call the ritual:  \n`do_algebra(list_of_sigils, list_of_stones)`  \nEach sigil in the first list corresponded to one of the operations\u2014the Shield (\u2018+\u2019), the Blade (\u2018-\u2019), the Hammer (\u2018*\u2019), the Scepter (\u2018//\u2019), or the Bolt (\u2018**\u2019)\u2014and the second list bore the number stones, all non-negative. The outcome would be the single number born from sequentially applying the sigils to the stones, from left to right.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Summoners of Numeria recounted an epic match:  \nSuppose the sigil sequence was [\u2018+\u2019, \u2018*\u2019, \u2018-\u2019], and the stones were [2, 3, 4, 5]. First, the duelist combined 2 and 3 with the Shield of Addition: 2 + 3 \u2192 5. Next, using the Hammer of Multiplication, 5 and 4 became 5 * 4 \u2192 20. Finally, the Blade of Subtraction turned 20 and 5 into 20 - 5 \u2192 15. But the wise Summoners knew that in ancient Numerian code, precedence reigned, so the correct computation honored the standard priority: first 3 * 4 \u2192 12, yielding 2 + 12 - 5, which led, step by orderly step, to 14 - 5 \u2192 9, thus resulting in a final score of 9.\n\nAnd so, in every duel, the victory condition was clear: given a sequence of sigils and stones, evaluate the magical expression as faithfully as Numerian order dictates, and present the one final number as the champion\u2019s reward. The legend of each input and output lives on, retold in the voices of the mathematicians and their enchanted stones.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Alfatech, there exists an ancient guild known as the Codemasters. Within their grand Archive lies a peculiar system for encrypting messages. Every new apprentice is tasked with learning the tradition of *Case-Turn*, a ritual for transforming secret texts before they reach the Guildmaster\u2019s desk. It is said that the system keeps the city's messages safe from prying automatons lurking in the shadows.\n\nThe ritual follows a peculiar set of rules, set forth by the guild's founders. Whenever an apprentice receives a scroll with a string of symbols, they must inspect each mark with care. For every emblem that belongs to the ancient families of Letters\u2014those who either bow in lowercase humility or stand tall in uppercase pride\u2014the apprentice must gently flip their posture: the lowercase ones must stand with newfound pride, and the uppercase ones must bow in humility. Symbols, numbers, and runes unclaimed by the Letter families must remain untouched, observed but not altered.\n\nYet, if a scroll should be inscribed entirely with markings foreign to the Letter bloodlines\u2014meaning not a single true Letter is present\u2014an altogether different rule must be obeyed. In this rare event, the apprentice is to grip the scroll at both ends and reverse its entire order, as if trapping a ghost of meaning between two mirrors, so that the message reads backward from tail to head, with every symbol preserved in its original form.\n\nTo daily practice this tradition, Codemasters devised a test: each apprentice is given a scroll and must return one of two things. If they spot even a single Letter within the script, they must provide a new string where every Letter has swapped its proud or humble stance, leaving all other symbols untouched. If no Letter graces the parchment, the apprentice must return the exact scroll, simply reversed end to end. Their wisdom is judged entirely on how well they follow this tradition\u2014never missing a Letter, nor failing to reverse as commanded.\n\nThe Guild records every apprentice's lesson in a log, where the string to be transformed is listed first, and the transformed result is recorded in a second line just below, mirroring the format:\n```\ninput_string\ntransformed_output\n```\nHere are some legends from past lessons:  \n- When one apprentice was handed the scroll *\"1234\"*, for which no Letters could be found, tradition demanded a reversal, yielding *\"4321\"*.  \n- Another scroll, passed down as *\"ab\"*, contained two humble Letter emblems; the apprentice restored these with proud, upright stances\u2014resulting in *\"AB\"*.  \n- An intricate glyph sequence, *\"#a@C\"*, held a single humble and a single proud Letter; the apprentice deftly transformed it to *\"#A@c\"*, flipping each as custom dictates.\n\nThus, the Codemasters\u2019 way ensures every message is prepared perfectly for the Guildmaster, using a blend of vigilance and tradition, forever guarding the secrets of Alfatech.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient kingdom of Digitallis, there existed a vast archive known as the Vault of Echoes. This vault was renowned across realms for its magical security: every message that entered its halls was transformed by the Enigmatic Codex, a mystical tome capable of turning words and sentences into cryptic sigils known as Echo Seals. These seals, forged from enchantments of order and transformation, were crucial; they ensured that each message became uniquely untraceable, yet could still be checked for authenticity by those who knew the incantation that created it.\n\nThe elders of Digitallis decreed strict customs for entering the Vault. When any visitor wished to store a message, the Enigmatic Codex would require the text itself\u2014whether a phrase, a declaration, or a single word. Using secret glyphs and patterns (which in the outsiders\u2019 tongue was called the \u201cMD5 transformation\u201d), the Codex would produce a unique, immutable seal for every distinct text. No matter how often the enchanted process was applied to the same message, the resulting Echo Seal would always be identical, but even a single rune\u2019s change in the message would conjure an entirely new seal.\n\nYet, the Codex held a particular rule, whispered through the marble corridors: if a visiting scribe arrived, parchment unmarked\u2014offering not a single letter or glyph\u2014then the Codex would respond in silence, bestowing not even a hint of a seal. In such cases, the absence of a record, symbolized by the ancient null rune, would signify that the message was empty and thus unworthy of cryptic forging.\n\nAcolytes tasked to interface with the Codex were given a routine. They would present a singular string of their choosing\u2014be it a burst of prose or nothing at all. The Codex\u2019s enchantment would then either return the gleaming Echo Seal, a cryptic sequence thirty-two glyphs strong (the MD5 string), or, should the parchment be blank, return only the null rune, representing an absence of magic. In more technical scrolls, it was thus: provide the Codex a text string; in return, receive either the unique seal or an explicit sign that nothing was inscribed.\n\nFor clarity\u2019s sake, consider the apprentice Mara, who once brought the phrase \u201cHello world\u201d into the Vault. The Codex whirred, spell-cogs turning, and handed her the Echo Seal \u201c3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62.\u201d In another instance, when a visitor brought forth a blank parchment, the Codex simply returned silence\u2014the magical equivalent of None.\n\nThus, the Codex\u2019s rules were clear: inscribe a message to receive its cryptic seal, but expect only silence in return from emptiness. Whether for a lone phrase or a lost memory, the answer lay ever in the Vault\u2019s unwavering enchantment.",

        "question_content": "In the verdant realm of Numeria, where every number is personified and walks the land with purpose, there is a secret order known as the Evenlight Guild. Its members are distinguished by their adherence to a singular, gleaming trait: their identification tags bear digits that are perfectly even. These Evenlights have long held a ceremonial responsibility\u2014to gather when summoned between two chosen markers, standing tall in their traditional ascending line, and display themselves only if they truly belong.\n\nEach year, the clerics of Numeria select two distinguished numbers\u2014let us call them the first and the second summoning stones. The stones may rest in any order upon the altar: sometimes the first is smaller, sometimes larger, but the Evenlight Guild cares not for such hierarchies. What matters above all is the range\u2014those worthy are any whose tags lie between the smallest and the largest of the chosen numbers, inclusive of the stones themselves. Yet, a stricter standard applies: only those whose tags are both even and single-digit may step forward, for only single-digit Evenlights bear the Guild's badge.\n\nA clever chronicler is tasked with writing a scroll that, given the numbers etched on the two summoning stones, reveals precisely which Evenlights may answer the call. If no worthy Evenlight walks among the range, the chronicler must simply ink an empty gathering\u2014no one attends the call. When the ritual is complete, those who do step forward are recorded in ever-increasing order, a sign of cosmic harmony.\n\nShould you wish to consult the old records, they appear in the following format: you first see the numbers revealed on both stones. These are presented on the opening line of the scroll, each inscribed with the ancient divider\u2014a single space. On the line below, the Evenlights who assembled are listed, each separated by a space as well, paying homage to orderliness. If the call went unanswered, the space remains bare.\n\nFor example, when the stones are etched with the numerals two and eight, the Evenlight Guild identifies those between the lowest and highest stone, including both. Four Evenlights answer: two, four, six, and eight, and so the chronicler writes:  \n2 8  \n2 4 6 8\n\nIf the stones are eight and two, the Guild recognizes that order is of no consequence\u2014the same four Evenlights arise:  \n8 2  \n2 4 6 8\n\nBut if the stones reveal the marks ten and fourteen, the call echoes in silence: there are no single-digit Evenlights between them, and the page records only:  \n10 14\n\nThus, in Numeria, the rule remains: should you set forth two summoning stones, it is the single-digit Evenlights between the smallest and the largest that gather, ready to be recorded by both the astute chronicler and any who seek the wisdom of their attendance.",

        "question_content": "In the land of Harmonia, music was not just a pastime\u2014it was the very rhythm that kept the world alive. The greatest composers of the age, known as the Keepers of Time, were entrusted with the sacred duty of transcribing melodies using an ancient script. This script was unlike any other; it encoded the length of each note not in numbers or words, but in cryptic symbols understood only by true musicians. Three such symbols governed their notation: a solitary circle, a circle with a staff, and a solitary dot with a staff.\n\nThe Keepers followed strict traditions: whenever they encountered an unadorned circle, it meant the note should be played for four steady heartbeats. If the circle was followed by a staff, it signified a shorter tone\u2014just two beats. The briefest of all was the dot with a staff, a fleeting sound lasting for only a single beat. This system had been followed for generations, ensuring that even the most complex symphonies could be precisely reconstructed by anyone fluent in the code.\n\nOne day, a young apprentice was tasked with a crucial mission: given a line of musical script written in this sacred language, they had to carefully interpret each symbol and reveal the underlying rhythm. Their task was to walk through the line, symbol by symbol, and produce a secret scroll that listed the number of beats each note demanded, in the exact order they appeared. Efficiency was prized, and the apprentice was to work through the script as directly as possible, ensuring not a single note was miscounted or skipped.\n\nTo aid future generations, the Keepers established a code for sharing music. The apprentice would receive, as the tale's input, a single line\u2014a string\u2014representing notes in the Harmonian script, where each note symbol was separated by a space. Their output would be a list of numbers, each number corresponding to the duration in beats for the matching note in the input, preserving the sequence of the melody. Thus, the translation from script to rhythm would be unambiguous and exact.\n\nSuppose, for example, the apprentice was given the musical line:  \n**\"o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o\"**  \nInterpreting each as the traditions dictated, the apprentice would record:  \n- The first \"o\" as four beats,  \n- The first \"o|\" as two beats,  \n- The \".|\" as one beat,  \n- The next two \"o|\"s as two beats each,  \n- The following four \".|\"s as one beat each,  \n- And finally, the last two \"o\"s as four beats each.\n\nThus, the apprentice would reveal the secret scroll as:  \n**[4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]**\u2014each number reflecting the duration of a note in the order it appeared in the musical line. And so, in Harmonia, the pulse of music was kept alive, one beat at a time.",

        "question_content": "In the distant land of Verbatimia, there lived a guild of scribes known for their mastery over the art of echo magic. These scribes were obsessed with patterns hidden in ancient scrolls\u2014mysterious runes that repeated themselves in strange and sometimes overlapping ways. The scrolls were made from long tapestries of letters and symbols, and the scribes\u2019 greatest challenge was to uncover how often a particular sequence, a spell fragment, reappeared along the scroll, even if the ends of one appearance overlapped with the beginning of the next.\n\nIn Verbatimia, the rules of echo magic were strict, passed down through generations. A scribe must examine one tapestry at a time, searching for a chosen spell fragment. Every place the spell fragment could start\u2014be it at the very beginning of the scroll, or somewhere deep within, even if the next possible start was inside the last spell\u2019s echo\u2014had to be counted. The only exception was if the scroll was empty; then, no echo could be found. Each echo, no matter how tightly it nestled into the previous one, was considered a valid discovery.\n\nTo aid visiting scholars, the scribes outlined the process as follows: One must present two offerings. The first is the scroll itself\u2014a string of symbols written in a single uninterrupted line. The second is the spell fragment\u2014a shorter string whose echoes are to be sought. The scribes would then reveal a single integer: the number of echoes found along the scroll, counting every possible overlapping occurrence. This was to help the guild discover the most frequent echoes, tracking their magical energy with utmost efficiency.\n\nFor those new to the guild\u2019s tradition, the scribes etched examples into the Hall of Learning. If a scholar brought an empty scroll and any spell fragment, no echo could ever be found; thus, the answer would always be zero. Should a scroll contain three identical symbols\u2014say, three repeating letters\u2014and the fragment be that same single letter, the echo would appear three times, once at each position. If a scroll contained four repeating letters and the spell fragment was two letters long, the echo would start at the first, second, and third positions\u2014overlapping as needed\u2014yielding three echoes.\n\nBefore the scholars departed, the scribes reminded them: the two offerings\u2014the scroll and the spell fragment\u2014must be presented as two lines of symbols, each line containing only the intended sequence. In return, the scribes would always respond with the echo count as a single number on its own line.\n\nThus, the wisdom of echo magic persisted, as each scholar learned to uncover every overlapping echo within the scrolls of Verbatimia, striving always to find as many echoes as possible, and to express their findings with both clarity and precision.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeria, every citizen is named after a unique number-word, from the youthful Zero to the stately Nine. Each year, the citizens gather for the Grand Parade of Order, a centuries-old tradition where participants must line up according to the ancient hierarchy\u2014youngest to oldest, with Zero at the front and Nine at the very end. The parade is not merely for show; it is a ritual that brings harmony to Numeria, ensuring that chaos never seeps into their world.\n\nThe Council of Numeria has laid down strict rules for the parade: only those whose names match the revered number-words\u2014Zero, One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, and Nine\u2014may participate. Every year, a scribe receives a secret list of citizen names, written in a single scroll where each name is separated by a small space. The scribe\u2019s duty is clear: arrange the names so that each person stands in the correct order, from the lowest rank (Zero) to the highest (Nine), ensuring that not a single misplacement occurs.\n\nTo guide future generations, the Council has decreed that every parade list must be prepared as follows: the scribe receives a message containing the names, written as a single line with each name separated by a space. After careful arrangement, the scribe must present the newly ordered line in the same space-separated format. Only the precise order\u2014from Zero to Nine\u2014is accepted; any deviation may disrupt the harmony of Numeria.\n\nYour task, should you find yourself as Numeria\u2019s scribe, is to take the list of names as written, and reorder them so that the parade\u2019s hierarchy is perfectly respected. Efficiency is prized\u2014no extra delays or confusion, just a clean and proper arrangement so the celebration can begin without mishap.\n\nFor example, imagine the scribe receives the message: \u201cThree One Five.\u201d In Numeria\u2019s tradition, One must stand before Three, who must in turn stand before Five. The correct parade order would then be: \u201cOne Three Five.\u201d This ensures that not only is the tradition honored, but the city\u2019s magical balance remains unbroken.\n\nIn summary, should you be tasked with organizing the Grand Parade, your duty is to:  \n**Input:** Receive a single line with any combination of the allowed names, separated by spaces.  \n**Output:** Return the same names, reordered so that they appear from the lowest to the highest according to Numeria\u2019s ancient number ordering, also separated by spaces.  \nFor instance, if given \u201cThree One Five,\u201d your answer must be \u201cOne Three Five\u201d\u2014restoring perfect order to Numeria once more.",

        "question_content": "In the land of Numeria, a peculiar tradition governs its annual Festival of Distances. Here, the wise elders invite all villagers to gather on the grand meadow, each bringing with them a single, uniquely weighted stone. Each stone\u2019s weight is marked with great precision, sometimes an integer and sometimes a curious fraction, and there are always at least two villagers joining the gathering. The elders believe that, hidden among the stones, there is a pair whose weights are closer than any other, and finding such a pair is a testament to a villager\u2019s perception and wit.\n\nThe festival\u2019s custom is exacting: every participant places their stone upon a great line drawn in the meadow, arranged in any order they wish. The challenge, as decreed by the elders, is to seek out and name the two stones whose weights are separated by the narrowest of margins\u2014a margin smaller than that of any other pair. If luck should have it that two stones possess precisely the same weight, they are considered the most inseparable pair of all. When more than one such pair exists, the pair whose lighter stone bears the smallest weight must be chosen.\n\nEach competitor is provided with a list of all the stone-weights present. They must return, as their answer, the weight of the lighter stone and then the heavier one, always in that order. The festival insists upon clarity: every stone\u2019s weight must be written as a number, and the answer is to be delivered as a pair. The elders require that this solution be as efficient and deliberate as possible so the festival\u2019s magic is not wasted on unnecessary calculations.\n\n**Input Format in Numeria:**  \nEach villager receives a list, spoken by the town crier, enumerating the weights of the stones in the meadow\u2014at least two numbers, each representing a distinct or repeated weight, each possibly fractional.\n\n**Output Format in Numeria:**  \nThe answer is to be a single pair of numbers: first, the smaller of the two closest weights, and second, the larger.\n\nLet us consider a couple of tales from past festivals. Once, when the stones weighed 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 2.2, the sharp-eyed Mirin spotted that the stones of weights 2.0 and 2.2 nestled closest together, with a difference narrower than any others; thus, (2.0, 2.2) was decreed the answer. In another year, when two villagers brought stones of the same weight\u20142.0\u2014and stood among stones of weights 1.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0, the answer was (2.0, 2.0), for no stones could sit closer than those perfectly matched in weight.\n\nAnd so, the tradition endures: the task is to uncover the pair of stones whose weights are most closely bound, recording them in the chronicles as proof of a villager\u2019s discernment and Numeria\u2019s enduring harmony.",

This gathering was not for song or dance, but for the sacred transformation of the \u201cNumber Stones\u201d\u2014a series of mystical pebbles, each imbued with a unique, shimmering value. Each year, villagers would bring at least a pair of these stones to the sages, seeking to have their values transformed so that the entire collection might be compared and understood on equal footing, no matter how vast or modest their original glow.\n\nThe rules of the ceremony were precise and unyielding. First, the sages would examine all the presented stones, ensuring the collection held at least two. Then, they would identify the dimmest and the brightest among them: the faintest flicker would be declared the starting mark, and the most luminous would set the aspirational peak. Through arcane ritual\u2014known only to the council\u2014they would draw a single line of transformation across all the stones. The faintest stone\u2019s glow would sink to the valley of zero, and the most radiant would ascend to the summit of one. Every other stone, regardless of its original brilliance, would be guided along this line, finding its own rightful place somewhere between the dawn of zero and the zenith of unity.\n\nThe objective of the ritual was always the same: to rescale the stones so that the lowest glow became the purest darkness, the highest shine reached the purest light, and all others fell proportionally between, preserving their original relationships. This process was executed with utmost efficiency\u2014no more, no less\u2014so that the transformation was as direct and fair as possible, and no stone was left misrepresented.\n\nTo partake in this rite, a villager would approach the sages with a list of the stones\u2019 current glows. These glows would be provided as a collection of luminous values, each separated by a pause. After the ritual, the sages would return the transformed glows in the same order, each now residing between complete darkness and complete light, and each expressed with the uncanny precision for which Numeria was renowned.\n\nFor example, when a villager presented stones shining with the values one, two, three, four, and five, the sages would return a new line of glows: zero for the first, followed by a quarter-light for the second, a half-light for the third, three-quarters for the fourth, and finally, pure unity for the last. In another instance, if the stones shimmered with the values two and eight, the council would transform them into zero and one, respectively, for only two stones leave no room for in-between. Each ceremony was a testament to the harmony of difference, and a reminder that, in Numeria, the full spectrum of brilliance could always be brought to a common scale.",

        "question_content": "In the enchanted land of Numeralis, a bustling marketplace thrives, filled with countless treasures from all corners of the realm. Among these goods are objects of every sort: shimmering crystals, mysterious tomes, unusual trinkets, and, most curiously, a collection of magical stones known for containing the pure essence of numbers. The merchants of Numeralis prize these stones above all else, for only the ones imbued with the power of whole numbers\u2014neither fragmented like fractions nor disguised as other objects\u2014are said to unlock the ancient vaults hidden beneath the city.\n\nTo avoid confusion amid the chaos of trade, the Guild of Stonekeepers has laid down a set of strict customs. They decree that only genuine number-stones, untouched by any hint of words, floating points, or deceptive facades, may be accepted by the vault guardians. Anything else\u2014be it a scroll, a delicate vase, a shimmering coin, or even a stone split into a non-whole shape\u2014must be left behind, for only the purest stones bear the vault\u2019s key.\n\nOne day, a young apprentice is tasked with preparing a consignment for the vault. Their job is simple yet crucial: from a given basket brimming with assorted goods, the apprentice must sort through and gather only the authentic, unbroken number-stones. As quickly and efficiently as possible, they must set aside all distractions\u2014letters, floating number fragments, hollow objects, and empty containers\u2014so that the consignment contains nothing but the precious, whole stones the vault demands.\n\nTo do this, the apprentice receives a scroll with instructions about how to record items for delivery. The scroll reads: \u201cFor each consignment, first write the count of goods (one number, at the start). Then, list every item exactly as it appears in the basket, whether it\u2019s a stone, a trinket, or a scroll. After that, show only the pure number-stones you have collected, in the order they appeared in the basket.\u201d\n\nFor instance, the apprentice once received a basket with just three items: a scroll emblazoned with the letter A, a crystal orb containing the number three and a fraction, and a solid number-stone marked with five. Upon reviewing the goods, the apprentice dutifully set aside the scroll and the orb, keeping only the whole number-stone, and presented it as their final selection. In another case, a basket held six items\u2014three unmistakable number-stones, a coded parchment, an empty vessel, and a curious box\u2014and the apprentice carefully extracted only the three stones, ignoring the rest.\n\nIn this way, the apprentice of Numeralis strives to fulfill the guild\u2019s wishes: to deliver, from baskets overflowing with all manner of things, only the pure number-stones that the ancient vaults will accept. In summary, the challenge is to seek out and return all whole number-stones from any assortment, following the guild\u2019s record-keeping rituals and leaving behind anything that does not fit the vault\u2019s age-old definition of purity.",

Some word-threads were lengthy and elaborate, while others were surprisingly short or, in rare cases, entirely knotless, representing silence.\n\nWithin Lexiconia, a cherished tradition governed the value of these word-threads. The Council of Letters had decreed that the worth of a word-thread was determined solely by the number of knots tied into it. No matter what colors or patterns the knots displayed, it was the count alone that mattered. If a word-thread was empty, possessing no knots at all, it was declared weightless\u2014holding a value of nothing.\n\nThe city\u2019s wise Keeper of Threads, a thoughtful scribe named Elowen, was charged with a simple yet vital task. Whenever a citizen approached, presenting their word-thread, Elowen would examine it and declare, \u201cThis thread holds the weight of\u2026\u201d followed by the precise number of knots it contained. Her role ensured fairness in contests, accurate tracking in the annual registry, and the proper weaving of names into the city\u2019s ever-growing tapestry.\n\nTo request Elowen\u2019s help, a citizen would hand her a scroll bearing their word-thread. The scroll contained a single line: the exact arrangement of knots (the \u201cstring\u201d), with no further embellishment or markings. Elowen, in turn, would respond with a single number written beneath, representing the total count of knots within that word-thread.\n\nFor instance, when a silent poet presented Elowen with a blank scroll, she solemnly acknowledged that the word-thread held no knots, and inscribed a zero in reply. Conversely, when a bard named \u201cabc\u201d unfurled their vibrant, three-knotted word-thread, Elowen counted each knot and responded with a three, honoring the bard\u2019s name.\n\nThus, the Keeper\u2019s task\u2014much like the magic of Lexiconia itself\u2014was both clear and precise: receive a word-thread from any citizen, and return, as swiftly and accurately as possible, the number of knots it contained, ensuring the city\u2019s ancient ledger remained ever true.",

        "question_content": "In the verdant realm of Numeria, famed for its mathematician guilds and ancient numeric runes, each year the Grand Divisor Challenge is held. Here, numerists from every corner of the land gather to solve riddles whispered by the Number Spirits\u2014enigmas that help keep the balance of Numeria\u2019s natural and magical forces. The challenge is not just a test of wit, but a tradition that maintains harmony among the numbers that underpin reality itself.\n\nThis year\u2019s riddle is as follows: Each participant is granted a single, mystical token, imbued with a number\u2014let\u2019s call this the Token\u2019s Power. The Number Spirits decree that within every such token, there lies a secret companion\u2014an integer friend who is less mighty than the token itself, yet divides the token\u2019s power cleanly, leaving behind not even a whisper of a remainder. Among all possible companions, the one with the greatest might is the true key to the challenge.\n\nThe ancient code of Numeria forbids seeking a companion equal in strength to the token, for balance must be preserved. Only those companions who are strictly weaker, yet still share an unbreakable bond with the token (by dividing its power evenly), may be considered. The task for every numerist is thus: for the number granted upon their token, seek out the strongest possible companion less than the token\u2019s own value\u2014this is the path to victory in the challenge.\n\nShould you wish to compete, you must present your Token\u2019s Power to the sages, who will then reveal the might of your greatest compatible companion. Numeria\u2019s records are kept in the following fashion: for each round, you provide a single integer, representing your Token\u2019s Power. In return, the sage will inscribe a single integer, the greatest companion\u2019s might as determined by the rules. This is the sacred exchange of the Grand Divisor Challenge.\n\nLet the lore be illustrated through tales of former numerists. Once, a hopeful youth arrived with a token bearing the mark of fifteen. After consulting the runes, the sages revealed that the greatest companion for such a token was five, for it was the largest number less than fifteen that divided fifteen with perfect harmony. Had the token\u2019s power been twenty-four, the companion would have been twelve, as no greater number less than twenty-four could divide evenly into it. Thus, every number\u2019s own challenge is unique, but the quest remains the same: seek the mightiest companion less than your token\u2019s own.\n\nAnd so, as the Grand Divisor Challenge continues through the ages, numerists remember: to win favor with the Number Spirits, uncover the highest bond of unity beneath your token\u2019s power, and present it to the world with pride.",

The wise sages of Numeria believed that every number\u2019s true nature could be unveiled by discovering the rare and powerful runestones that, when multiplied together, would reveal the original chest\u2019s value. These runestones were none other than the sacred prime stones, each bearing a unique power, and no two of them could combine to form another of their kind.\n\nIn Numeria, there were strict magical traditions about how treasures could be unlocked. Any adventurer who wished to open a chest had to collect the exact set of prime runestones needed\u2014no more, no fewer. Moreover, if the same kind of prime runestone was required more than once, it must be used exactly that number of times, and always in order from the least potent to the most powerful; the sages believed this sequence preserved cosmic harmony. The only input a chest would accept was its secret number, and the only output it would reveal was the full sequence of required prime runestones, listed in the order from the smallest to the largest, with repeats included as necessary.\n\nYour quest, then, is this: Given the secret number inscribed on a Numerian treasure chest, gather the smallest possible collection of prime runestones, with each runestone included as many times as it\u2019s required by the magical rules. Present the sequence of runestones in ascending order. The goal is to break the secret of the chest as completely and efficiently as possible, using only these prime stones in the necessary order, so that their combined magic (the product of their strengths) exactly matches the number on the chest.\n\nTo embark on this quest, the chest will present you with a parchment containing a single number\u2014the chest\u2019s secret code. You must return a list of the sacred prime runestones, each listed as many times as necessary, in order from the smallest to the largest. This will satisfy the Numerian tradition and unlock the chest\u2019s magic.\n\nFor example, imagine a chest whose secret is the number eight. The wise adventurer would know to gather three runestones, each of strength two, for the product of two times two times two is eight. For a chest with the secret twenty-five, only two runestones are needed, each with a strength of five. If the chest\u2019s secret is seventy, the adventurer brings three runestones: one of strength two, one of five, and one of seven, in that order. In each case, the runestones are listed in ascending order, and their combined strength exactly reveals the chest\u2019s secret.\n\nNow, brave seeker, go forth among the treasures of Numeria, revealing their secrets by gathering the precise set of prime runestones demanded by tradition, always in proper order, and let the chests of Numeria yield their hidden wonders unto you.",

The procession is lively, but the city\u2019s wise scribe, Lady Tally, faces a peculiar challenge: certain townsfolk have, by some mischief or mistake, taken to carrying the same number as another. The city\u2019s tradition demands that only those whose number is unique\u2014neither repeated nor copied\u2014are recorded in the official Book of Names for that year.\n\nTo ensure this, Lady Tally follows the sacred census rules. She watches the townsfolk march in, one by one, their numbers presented in a specific, unchanging order. For every stone that appears more than once, she quietly sets it aside; only those whose number appears exactly once, and whose order of arrival is unaltered, earn their place in the Book. The rest\u2014the repeated ones\u2014are gently excused from history\u2019s memory.\n\nThe festival\u2019s challenge is straightforward yet vital: given a sequence of stones (numbers), Lady Tally must pen a new list, preserving the order of those stones that were carried by a sole bearer. She must not rearrange the sequence, and she must not allow a number that appears more than once to slip into her final account. Her task is to make this list as complete as possible, including every unique stone, and omitting all others.\n\nWhen the census begins, the city crier delivers instructions for the townsfolk. Each census will start by stating exactly how many stones will be presented, followed by the numbers on each stone, in the order they arrive. Once Lady Tally has done her work, she announces the names of the honored few whose numbers were not copied, listing them in the order they entered.\n\nFor example, on one bustling census day, five stones were carried in: the numbers were one, two, three, two again, and four. Lady Tally noted that the number two appeared twice and thus set both aside. The remaining stones\u2014one, three, and four\u2014were inscribed in order into the Book of Names. Thus, the city crier would read:\n- Input: 5  \n  1 2 3 2 4  \n- Output: 1 3 4\n\nAnd so each census, no matter the size or the numbers, follows these ancient rules, ensuring Numeria\u2019s records remain both fair and true.",

The pendant\u2019s power is peculiar: it reflects the nature of its bearer. Those who are bold and adventurous shine with grand, capital runes, while the gentle and humble glow with soft, tiny glyphs. For generations, an ancient tradition has been upheld\u2014during the Festival of the Twinned Tides, each citizen must don a mirrored version of their identity: the boisterous become meek, and the meek, bold.\n\nThe grand council of Lexiconia has set forth the rules for this ritual. Each name, composed solely of letters, must undergo the Rite of Reflection. In this rite, every letter that is large and proud must be transformed into its smaller, softer counterpart, and every letter that is small and quiet must swell into its grandest form. The sequence of letters in the name, however, must remain unchanged; only the character of the letters may shift. \n\nYour role is that of the Mirror Keeper\u2014a scribe entrusted with enacting this transformation for every name presented to you. For each name you receive, you must perform the Ritual of Reversal: scan each letter, and if it stands tall, help it bow; if it bows, lift it tall. The aim is to ensure every identity is mirrored as precisely as possible, reflecting every aspect of the old self into its opposite, without leaving a single rune unchanged.\n\nWhen the townsfolk approach you, they do so one at a time, each revealing the inscription from their pendant\u2014one line at a time. For each such inscription you receive, you must return a single line in response, with every character reversed in stature as per the tradition.  \n\nTo guide you, here is how the ceremony unfolds:\n- Each festival-goer will whisper their inscription (a single string of letters) to you.\n- You must respond with a single string, matching their original in length and order, but with every capital letter made small and every small letter made grand.\n- For example, if a visitor shares the word \"Hello\" from their pendant, you must return \"hELLO,\" reflecting the true magic of the Festival.\n\nLet us see how this ritual works, using these ceremonial samples:\n\n- If the pendant reveals:  \n  **Input:** `Hello`  \n  **You must respond:** `hELLO`  \n  *(for the initial \"H\" bows, while the others boldly rise)*\n\nAnd so, the traditions of Lexiconia endure\u2014each name mirrored, each spirit reflected, and every festival-goer sent forth to celebrate their transformed self beneath the twinned tides.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Lexiconia, the clever Scribes of the Stitched Scrolls had a daily challenge. Each morning, townsfolk would bring to the Scribes a queue of parchment slips, each bearing a single word or phrase. These slips could be numerous, or sometimes, not a single one would arrive. The Scribes' duty was to take all the parchment slips handed to them and, using their time-honored technique, seamlessly bind the words together, forming a single, continuous message without any spaces or marks between them.\n\nThe process in Lexiconia followed clear customs. The Scribes would receive a bundle of parchment slips\u2014perhaps none, perhaps many. If no slips arrived, tradition held that the Scribes would return an empty scroll, signifying the absence of any message. If slips were present, each word or phrase would be pressed edge-to-edge with the next, their ink merging so perfectly that only the original order remained as a clue to their arrangement. No embellishments or extra symbols were ever added; the Scribes prided themselves on unadorned purity in their work.\n\nEach day's logbook began with a record of how many slips would be presented for that session. Following this count, a listing of the slips themselves, in the precise order they were handed over, would be documented. The expectation was clear: the Scribes would return a single, freshly-bound scroll carrying all of the words merged without interruption. And so, the process was as efficient as it was exact, with no room for deviation.\n\nThe Scribes' task, then, was to take a collection of written fragments and forge them into a solitary, unmarred message\u2014never omitting a slip, never altering the order, and always ensuring the resulting scroll reflected the townsfolk\u2019s intent as completely as possible. Their efficiency in binding these slips was legendary; not even a single stroke of ink was wasted, and the work was always completed in the minimum time necessary.\n\nFor those new to Lexiconia\u2019s customs, the logbook entries served as both a guide and a record. Each entry began with a single number, quietly stating how many slips would be merged that day, followed by that many lines\u2014each containing one word or phrase from a parchment slip. The Scribes would read the number, then the slips, and finally return a scroll bearing the full, unbroken message.\n\nConsider, for example, a morning when no townsfolk appeared. The Scribes recorded \"0\" in the logbook, and, true to tradition, returned an empty scroll. On another day, three slips arrived: \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\". The Scribes, following their well-worn methods, bound the slips into a single scroll reading \"abc\", which they presented to the delighted messenger. Such was the elegance and order of Lexiconia, where every message\u2014no matter how fragmentary\u2014found its perfect form in the Scrolls of the Scribes.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Lexiconia, the residents communicated not through spoken language, but by exchanging inscribed scrolls. Each scroll bore a unique inscription\u2014a string of letters\u2014that identified its purpose and origin. Among the many guilds within Lexiconia, there was a secretive group known as the Prefix Seekers. Their mission: to find all scrolls beginning with a particular magical sequence of symbols, known in their tongue as \"the chosen prelude.\"\n\nThe council of Lexiconia, ever keen on order, established several important decrees for the Prefix Seekers. The first decree stated that the Seekers would always be given a collection of scrolls\u2014sometimes a vast library, sometimes none at all. Alongside this collection, the council would name the chosen prelude, a sequence of characters that the Seekers must use to guide their search. There were no restrictions on the length or contents of these scrolls or the prelude, but the Seekers were expected to work swiftly, as the collections could sometimes contain up to ten thousand inscriptions.\n\nThe Seekers' quest unfolded thus: For each scroll in the given collection, they would inspect its opening characters. If the scroll's inscription began precisely with the chosen prelude, it was marked as worthy and set aside. Scrolls lacking this initial sequence were left untouched, for the Seekers valued only those that honored the prelude from the very start.\n\nTo inform future generations of their method, the Seekers devised a ritual for presenting their findings. When a new challenge was issued, the Seekers would first be handed two items: a list of scrolls (presented in the order received, each bearing its inscription) and the chosen prelude (delivered as a single sequence of letters). After performing their task, they would produce, in the same order as found, a new list containing only the inscriptions of the worthy scrolls\u2014those that honored the prelude at their beginning. If no scrolls met the criteria, the Seekers' report would be an empty list, a sign that the prelude found no kin that day.\n\nLet us consider the rituals as they played out in Lexiconia. In one instance, when the Seekers were presented with an empty library of scrolls and the prelude \"a,\" they found nothing to report\u2014no scrolls could possibly honor the prelude, so their answer was an empty list. On another day, the Seekers sifted through the inscriptions \"abc,\" \"bcd,\" \"cde,\" and \"array,\" seeking the prelude \"a.\" With careful scrutiny, they found two scrolls\u2014\"abc\" and \"array\"\u2014that opened with the chosen symbols, and so they compiled these into their report.\n\nThus, the wisdom of the Prefix Seekers endures in Lexiconia, guiding all who seek patterns among words. Their tradition ensures that, given any collection of scrolls and any chosen prelude, one may always discern those inscriptions that begin just so, preserving the order of discovery and the clarity of their search for generations to come.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeria, there existed a peculiar vault said to hold the fate of its owner's reputation. Each citizen could open such a vault, but the city\u2019s council had set forth an unusual tradition: whenever someone made a transaction\u2014be it a gift deposited or a debt collected\u2014it would be carefully recorded in a ledger, starting from an empty slate. The fortunes of the vault ebbed and flowed with each entry, and the council watched with keen interest.\n\nThe rules of Numeria\u2019s vault were as follows. Citizens performed a series of actions\u2014some added to their fortune (these were gifts or windfalls, always counted as positive entries), while others required payment for past promises and debts (these were subtractions, marked as negative entries). The tradition demanded that the vault never dipped below emptiness. If, at any moment, the tally of gifts and debts caused the vault\u2019s value to slip into the negative, the council would instantly declare the owner in breach of the vault\u2019s honor.\n\nYour challenge as Numeria\u2019s trusted chronicler is thus: for a given sequence of entries\u2014first a count of how many actions are to take place, then the actions themselves, listed in order\u2014you must determine whether the vault\u2019s balance ever falls beneath zero. As soon as you see the balance slip into the negative, you must report this with a resounding, \u201cYES!\u201d If, after all entries, the vault has never gone below zero, then you must respectfully say, \u201cNO.\u201d\n\nTo guide the council\u2019s record keeping, messages are received in this form: the first line tells how many entries are to be processed, and the next line contains each entry\u2014positive for gifts, negative for debts\u2014in the order they occur. Once you have reviewed them all, you deliver just one word: \u201cYES\u201d if the vault has ever been negative, \u201cNO\u201d otherwise.\n\nConsider the tale of Ada, who received three consecutive gifts: a single coin, then two coins, and finally three. Numeria\u2019s custom would have you record:\n\n```\n3\n1 2 3\n```\nUpon review, the vault never dips below zero, so you announce:  \n`NO`\n\nNow, witness the saga of Brin, who received one coin, then two more, only to be suddenly taxed four coins for an old mischief, and later managed to earn five coins back. The records appear as:\n\n```\n4\n1 2 -4 5\n```\nAfter the third action, the vault plunges below emptiness, so you exclaim:  \n`YES`\n\nIn this way, Numeria\u2019s balance keepers ensure that the integrity of every vault is preserved, and that every slip below zero is keenly observed and reported.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling kingdom of Numeria, the Royal Court of Numbers governed all lists brought forth by villagers from across the land. The villagers often wandered the forests, riversides, and market stalls, collecting stones inscribed with a curious range of values\u2014some radiating the bright golden glow of positivity, others weighed down by a shadowy aura of negativity, and a rare few possessing neither glow nor shade at all.\n\nWithin Numeria, it was an age-old tradition that only those stones befit for prosperity\u2014those shimmering with positive energy\u2014could be offered at the grand Festival of Fortunes. The Royal Oracle, who presided over the court, was tasked with an important duty. Whenever a villager arrived bearing a satchel filled with numbered stones, the Oracle\u2019s task was to sift tirelessly, keeping aside only those that gleamed with the essence of positivity. Stones cloaked in shadows, or those utterly mundane and devoid of all aura, had no place in the joyous festival display.\n\nEach time a villager entered the court, they presented an array of stones, laying them out as a list. The Oracle was required to examine each one, banishing any whose value succumbed to the blight of negativity or was dulled by the absence of positive energy. Only those stones greater in value than none\u2014those that pulsed with a brilliance far exceeding the shadow or neutrality\u2014were deemed worthy to remain. The Oracle carefully gathered these into a new line, arranged precisely as the villagers had presented them, without changing their sequence.\n\nWhenever villagers prepared to consult the Oracle, they would note the numbers on their stones in order, providing a list for the Oracle\u2019s scrutiny. In the Oracle\u2019s official logs, the record read much like this: when presented with a line of stones, the Oracle would return a refined list containing precisely those stones that shone with positive energy, maintaining the original order. For example, a villager might present their stones as follows:  \n**Input:** `[-1, 2, -4, 5, 6]`  \nThe Oracle would return:  \n**Output:** `[2, 5, 6]`  \nAnother villager might lay down:  \n**Input:** `[5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]`  \nAnd receive back:  \n**Output:** `[5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]`\n\nIn the Oracle\u2019s Book of Guidance, this divination was recorded as a function called \u201cget_positive,\u201d where a villager\u2019s list of stones would be taken as the input, and the refined list\u2014the Festival-worthy stones\u2014would be the output. The Oracle\u2019s decision-making followed the logic: select from the input only those values strictly greater than neutrality (that is, more than zero), and return them in the order they appear. Thus, the villagers of Numeria learned to trust the wisdom of the Royal Oracle, always assured that only the brightest stones would light their path to fortune.\n\nAnd so, in Numeria, every successful festival honored those who not only gathered stones, but who also understood the magical law of positivity: only that which glows may enter the Festival of Fortunes, and the Oracle\u2019s logic, woven through every list, ensured the kingdom prospered in brightness and order.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Numerium, numbers are more than simple symbols\u2014they are living spirits, each with their own nature and story. These number-spirits are renowned for gathering at the Grand Hall of Divisions, where debates about indivisibility settle their status in the arithmetic aristocracy. Among them, a most prestigious title exists: to be named a \u201cPrime Noble.\u201d This title is reserved only for those number-spirits who cannot be split evenly by any of their peers, excepting only the spirits One and themselves.\n\nA well-respected tradition guides the assignment of this title. Every number-spirit greater than One must prove its indivisibility before the Elders. The Elders decree that a Prime Noble is a noble who possesses a remarkable quality: when challenged by any number-spirit whose value is more than One but less than themselves, they cannot be evenly divided\u2014no spirit, except for One and themselves, can share their essence perfectly without remainder. A spirit lacking this property\u2014being divisible by any other\u2014must forgo Prime Nobility, deemed \u201cComposite\u201d and fated to join the bustling commonfolk.\n\nEach year, the Council requests your expertise, as Court Oracle, to pronounce judgment on the status of a given number-spirit. For any number delivered to your chambers, your sacred duty is to consult the ancient methods and declare, with truth, whether that number-spirit is Prime Noble or not. The council gives you their question as a single integer, and expects you to return only a word of truth or falsehood: reveal \u201cTrue\u201d if the spirit is deserving of the title, or \u201cFalse\u201d if not.\n\nThe court dictates this ceremonial exchange through a formal function, casting their query as follows:  \n`is_prime(the_number)`  \nand expecting from you the pronouncement in return. The response must always be either \u201cTrue\u201d if Prime Noble, or \u201cFalse\u201d otherwise, in strict accordance with their ancient laws.\n\nTo illustrate these decrees with examples:  \nWhen the Council inquires about the spirit Six, your wisdom affirms, \u201cFalse,\u201d for Six can be evenly parted by both Two and Three, disqualifying it from Prime Nobility. Yet when the inquiry concerns One Hundred and One, you declare \u201cTrue,\u201d for this number-spirit withstands every division but its own and that of One. Similarly, spirits Eleven, Thirteen Thousand Four Hundred Forty-One, and Sixty-One all earn their Prime Noble status\u2014each time, your answer is \u201cTrue.\u201d But the spirits Four and One fall short, both receiving your \u201cFalse\u201d judgment under the rigorous scrutiny of the council\u2019s rules.\n\nThus, as Oracle of Numerium, your proclamations echo through the city, upholding with logical precision the grandeur of Prime Nobility\u2014pronouncing \u201cTrue\u201d or \u201cFalse\u201d at every official query, ensuring the city\u2019s ancient order of indivisibility remains pure and strong.",

        "question_content": "Once upon a time in the bustling city of Triadopolis, the people believed luck and fate cycled through their lives in patterns of three. Every citizen kept a special bracelet of charms\u2014each bead on the bracelet held a number, reflecting life events or achievements. These charms were added in a line, and everyone\u2019s bracelet told the story of their fortunes and trials.\n\nThere was, however, a peculiar tradition: once a year, on the Festival of Accordance, the Grand Custodian would decree that only certain positions on the bracelet\u2014those whose place in the line could be perfectly shared among three people\u2014could be blessed and changed for the coming year. For the other charms, their fate could not be altered; their place and number would remain untouched, preserved by magic. The blessed positions, however, had to be rearranged among themselves so that their numbers told the most harmonious and promising story possible. To the citizens, this meant arranging only those special beads\u2014those whose position counted from the start, not from one but from the first spot, was a perfect fit in a group of three\u2014in a new and ascending order. The rest, not privileged by such arithmetic fortune, were left untouched.\n\nThis annual rearrangement required a trusted magistrate who, given the line of numbers from a bracelet, would extract all beads sitting at these magical positions (counting the first as zero), sort only those numbers, and slip them gently back into their original places\u2014while leaving all other beads exactly as they were found. The harmony lay in how efficiently and precisely the magistrate could perform the task for anyone in the city, no matter how long or varied their bracelet.\n\nThe format in which the magistrate received their tasks was simple: a list of numbers describing the beads (for example, [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]), and after the ceremony, the result was to be handed back as a new list of numbers, where only the auspicious beads (every third bead, counting from the start at zero) were reordered in the most pleasing, ascending fashion.\n\nLet it be known that if a bracelet had just three beads, say [1, 2, 3], and the magical spot was the very first bead, only that one would be eligible for blessing and, finding no other bead to join it, its number would remain unchanged, resulting in [1, 2, 3]. If, however, a citizen presented a bracelet of seven beads\u2014like [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]\u2014the Grand Custodian would notice that the first, fourth, and seventh positions (again, counting from the first at position zero) were the ones whose numbers were reborn. Collecting the numbers from these beads (5 from the first, 4 from the fourth, and 2 from the seventh), the magistrate would sort them into the sequence 2, 4, 5, then return the finished bracelet: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5].\n\nThus, on each Festival of Accordance, the people of Triadopolis would consult the magistrate with their bracelets, seeking the most harmonious rearrangement allowed by tradition. In every record book, the calling of this blessing upon a bracelet was written as follows: the input was the list of numbers; the result was the same list, but with magical positions refreshed and the rest left untouched. And through these rituals of logic and lore, Triadopolis thrived in a balance of fate and order.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeria, legendary archivists known as the Sorters presided over the Tower of Lists. These diligent folk safeguarded all manner of collections, from ancient rolls of numbers to the newest records imported from distant lands. But among their many duties, one resounded with particular importance: organizing the lists so that no story, memory, or ancient cipher would ever be repeated or misplaced. The people trusted the Sorters to preserve only the rarest threads of history and to unfailingly keep their record halls in perfect order.\n\nWhenever a new collection\u2014a traveler\u2019s tally, a merchant\u2019s ledger, or a bard\u2019s songbook\u2014was brought to the Tower, the Sorters followed an age-old code. They would examine each entry within the collection and, should any number appear more than once, it would be placed upon the \u201cRepetition Shelf.\u201d Only numbers with no twins or triplets would be left in the official ledger, ensuring that every value inscribed was unique\u2014no echoes, shadows, or copycats. Once all duplicates were removed, they performed the Ritual of Arrangement, aligning the numbers from the smallest to the greatest, as was the Numerian way.\n\nIn the tradition of the Tower, visitors who wished for their lists to be preserved had to present the full set at the archivist's desk as a string of numbers, declared in the local Numerian tongue (for instance: five, three, five, two, three, three, nine, zero, one hundred twenty-three). The Sorter's art required not just removing repetitions, but arranging the rare numbers in ascending order\u2014ensuring the memory of each collection would be as readable as possible in the future. Only after this process could the unique, sorted record be placed in the archives.\n\nFor mathematicians and wanderers wishing to entrust their lists to the Tower, there was a standard inscription ceremony\u2014the Keeper called for a parchment bearing all numbers in a sequence, and from this, the archivists would return a new parchment listing, in order, only those numbers that remained once all twins and echoes had been quieted. The process was efficient and customarily expected to be as concise as possible, letting neither superfluous memory nor disorder tarnish Numeria\u2019s proud legacy.\n\nTo illustrate, suppose the Tower was handed a ledger inscribed with the numbers five, three, five, two, three, three, nine, zero, and one hundred twenty-three. After applying the tried-and-true process\u2014casting out repeated numbers and setting the rest in order\u2014the archivists would present the final and proper record: zero, two, three, five, nine, one hundred twenty-three.\n\nHere is how such a request and its response might be recorded in the annals of Numeria:\n\n**Input:** [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]  \n**Output:** [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]  \n\nThis is the tale of how the Sorters of Numeria preserved the purity and order of every list, ensuring that only the rarest, most unique numbers ever found their way into history.",

Within Numeria, communities convene regularly to admire a collection of tokens\u2014each token uniquely marked with its own power, able to be positive, negative, or even zero. These collections, known as \u201cthe Assemblies,\u201d are central to Numerian tradition, for citizens believe that every Assembly holds a single Chosen Token: the one with the greatest might among them all.\n\nEach Assembly presents its tokens in a single serpent-like row. It is a rite to identify the Chosen Token of every ceremonial gathering, no matter how vast or humble, as quickly and accurately as possible\u2014this is regarded as a test of one\u2019s perceptive prowess. The Numerians dismiss all ornament or distraction; only the actual power etched on each token matters in the quest.\n\nYour challenge, should you find yourself in Numeria, is to act as the Seeker of Power. At every gathering, you will be handed a scroll inscribed with a sequence of numbers in the Numerian tongue\u2014this sequence is the Assembly\u2019s tokens. You must read this scroll and announce the highest number recorded upon it, for only that token is worthy of leading Numerian celebrations.\n\nTo fulfill this task, the Seeker accepts inputs in a modest fashion: the powers on the tokens gathered into a single string, enclosed between brackets, with each value separated by a comma\u2014just as Numerian scribes would script them. The output is almost ceremonial: you simply reveal the single value, the greatest among them, to the assembly\u2014no embellishment required.\n\nFor example, consider a scroll delivered with the markings `[1, 2, 3]`. Survey the procession and proclaim the mightiest token: three, for none surpasses it. On another occasion, you\u2019re presented with `[5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]`. In this robust gathering, the Chosen Token is one hundred and twenty-three, dazzling all lesser numbers with its supremacy.\n\nThus, the grand goal in Numeria is to always discern and declare the greatest power residing among any list of tokens\u2014no matter how many or what form they take\u2014presented to you in their ceremonial stringed format, and to do so with swiftness and precision, just as the ancient Numerian decree demands.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient archipelago of Numeria, each islander revered the mystical powers of certain numbers, weaving them into their daily customs and lore. Among all the numbers, the villagers held a special intrigue for the numbers aligned with the celestial spirits of Eleven and Thirteen\u2014a rare fellowship in their land, for only those fortunate numbers blessed by either spirit commanded respect at the island festivals. However, what fascinated Numerian historians most was the hidden presence of the \u201cSevens,\u201d enchanted symbols believed to bring fortune and mystery when they appeared within such revered numbers.\n\nEvery decade, the High Scholar of Numeria would set forth a special census. This census had very clear boundaries: islanders would consider every number from one up to, but not including, some chosen upper limit, which was always declared as a single mystical integer known as the census crest. For practicality and order, the High Scholar announced the census crest aloud, instructing the scribes to disregard all numbers from that point onward. This upper limit, governed by the symbol N, could range as high as one hundred thousand if the census demanded\u2014a truly monumental event.\n\nThe rules of this census ritual were precise. Out of the entire range of numbers considered, the scribes were told to focus only on those rare numerals that could form perfect circles or patterns with either the spirit of Eleven or the spirit of Thirteen, meaning the number would align perfectly (with no remnants) if shared among Eleven folk or Thirteen folk. Among these chosen numbers, the task was to count, with utmost care and accuracy, every individual instance where the enchanted symbol \u201cSeven\u201d appeared within the digits of these numbers. The festival\u2019s success depended not just on pinpointing such numbers but on spotting every occurrence of the symbol, even if it shimmered more than once within a single sacred numeral.\n\nThe goal of the census was not simply to sample or estimate, but to tally each and every appearance of the enchanted \u201cSeven\u201d among all qualified numbers under the census crest. Only through such a thorough count could the scholars claim true understanding of Numeria\u2019s magical numerals and celebrate their findings at the Decadal Festival. Thus, they sought to report a single, unadorned number: the complete count of \u201cSeven\u201ds found among the chosen numbers below the crest, as efficiently and fairly as magic and mathematics would permit.\n\nTo consult this enchantment, a scribe would whisper the census crest\u2014a single integer\u2014into the gleaming census orb. The orb would return a single integer: the total count of enchanted \u201cSeven\u201ds within the boundary set by their rules. For instance, if the scholar set the census crest at the value 50, the tally would be zero, since none of the numbers under 50, both respected by Eleven or Thirteen, bore the \u201cSeven.\u201d A census crest at 78, however, drew forth the number two, since two entire \u201cSeven\u201ds sparkled in the eligible numbers below seventy-eight. For a crest of 79, the orb would sing the answer three, commemorating an additional \u201cSeven\u201d in the newest eligible number.\n\nAs the festival approached, the High Scholar ensured that these instructions and examples were scribed into the Great Numerian Annals. The community, young and old, could thus understand how to invoke the census ritual with their own census crest, and marvel at every \u201cSeven\u201d hidden in the shadow of the spirits of Eleven and Thirteen.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Numeria, every year a grand parade weaves through the streets, with citizens lining up in a great procession. Each citizen stands in a precise order\u2014one after the other, forming a single file. But in Numeria, the order of citizens isn't left entirely to chance: the Council of Parity oversees a unique tradition that ensures harmony and curiosity among all those who march.\n\nAccording to the Parity Code, the Council decrees two distinct customs in the alignment of these processions. First, those who stand at what the Numerians call \u201codd positions\u201d (which, by the city\u2019s measure, are every second place starting from the very first in line), must keep their place unwavering, their identity unaltered and undisturbed\u2014no matter how disordered they may appear. Conversely, those at the \u201ceven positions\u201d (occupying the second, fourth, sixth places, and so on, as counted from the very first), are collectively visited by the Sorting Sage before the parade begins. The Sorting Sage, with gentle wisdom, quietly rearranges only these even-placed citizens among themselves, placing them in order from the youngest to the eldest, or perhaps from the shortest to the tallest, depending on this year's chosen symbolism.\n\nThe task at hand each year is thus as follows: given the lineup of citizens as they present themselves (recorded as a list, with each citizen's identifying number or characteristic), preserve each citizen in the odd places exactly where they stand, but subtly reorder those in the even places among themselves so that, taken by themselves, these even-placed individuals appear perfectly sorted. The goal is to realize this as efficiently and thoroughly as possible, never disturbing the stability of the parade\u2019s choreography.\n\nFor those who wish to participate as the Sorting Sage, they must receive a scroll which lists the lineup in order\u2014the first entry represents the person at the very front, the second entry the next in line, and so forth, right to the parade\u2019s end. Their duty is to return a new line-up in exactly the same format, with the arrangement transformed by the Council\u2019s decree: all odd positions untouched, all even positions rearranged into their correctly sorted order. To record their handiwork, they present the transformed parade as a list, in matching sequence.\n\nLet us look to examples from past parades. Suppose the initial lineup is written as [1, 2, 3]: here, the one in front and the third in place must not move, so only the second place could be rearranged\u2014but since there is only one such person, nothing changes ([1, 2, 3]). In another year, the parade is [5, 6, 3, 4]: those standing in the first and third places remain, but the participants in the second and fourth places\u2014here carrying the numbers 6 and 4\u2014are quietly swapped by the Sorting Sage so that their order is ascending, producing [3, 6, 5, 4].\n\nThrough this careful, respectful system, Numeria\u2019s parade preserves both the integrity of tradition (for the odd-placed) and the Order of Evenness (for the even-placed). Every year, as citizens march through the heart of the city, they do so both as individuals and as participants in a centuries-old puzzle\u2014one bestowed by the wisdom of the Parity Council, and solved anew by anyone who dares to play the Sorting Sage\u2019s role.",

        "question_content": "In the distant land of Cypheria, words held a curious magic: every phrase would shimmer and rearrange itself when whispered into the air, protecting secrets from prying eyes. The arch-scribe of Cypheria decreed a custom for transmitting secret notes between guilds: for messages to be concealed properly, each must pass through the Trial of the Turning Cycle. According to legend, Cypheria\u2019s scholars long ago discovered that if a message traveled too plainly, it attracted mischievous spirits, making the system of cycles essential for secure communication.\n\nHere is how the Turning Cycle works, as written in the Book of Hidden Letters. First, the entire message is carefully divided into as many trios of letters as possible, starting from the opening syllable. Whenever a full trio is formed, the guildmaster presiding over the rite must pluck the first letter and gently place it at the very end of its group, thus cycling the three\u2014so the second and third characters shuffle forward, and the original leader takes their place at the rear. If the remaining letters form a group fewer than three\u2014perhaps two or even a solitary glyph\u2014they are left undisturbed, as the spirits cannot sense such small morsels. In this way, the entire note becomes cleverly transformed, yet can always be methodically reconstructed by anyone versed in the ancient order.\n\nIt fell to Cypheria\u2019s youngest rune-reader, Elian, to both decipher such encoded scrolls and to teach others the sacred means to reverse this Turning Cycle. To break the cycle, Elian explained, you must again respect the trios: for any group of precisely three, the last letter must be guided back to the beginning of its group, restoring original order\u2014the tail returns to its mantle as the head. Any group smaller than three is to remain unharmed, as always.\n\nWhen a message was to be encoded or decoded, the guildmasters would declare their methods in scrolls that indicated a list of messages\u2014each as a sequence of letters without spaces. The result of the ancient magic was then written as another scroll for each message, displaying the transformed phrase. For example, consider the phrase \"abcdefg\" offered by a novice. As prescribed, the message is split into \"abc\", \"def\", \"g\". The first two trios are cycled to become \"bca\" and \"efd\", while the final letter remains \"g\", leading to an encoded message: \"bcaefdg\". To decipher, Elian would reverse the shift for each trio, leading back to \"abcdefg\".\n\nAs a final ritual, Cypheria\u2019s elders crafted a test: given these whispers as input\u2014one string per scroll, with their encoded or decoded forms shown on the next line\u2014apprentices must reproduce the Order of the Cycle as efficiently and for as many scrolls as needed. Every rule and secret must be honored faithfully in each passage, for only those who could master the Turning Cycle were allowed into the scriptorium\u2019s deepest vaults. Thus, the legend of the cycling messages remains a proud cornerstone of Cypheria\u2019s secret-keeping even to this day.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient, arithmetical kingdom of Numeria, convened a wise Circle of Seekers tasked with unraveling the grand tapestry of numbers woven into the very fabric of the realm. Among the endless patterns alive in their land, two stood out as the most revered\u2014the Sequence of Growth, in which each new creature was born from the union of its two forebears (the Seekers called these the Children of Fibonacci), and the Chosen Primes, individuals so unique that they could only be divided cleanly by themselves and the First One.\n\nThe Seekers followed strict traditions handed down the generations. Each time a child joined the Sequence of Growth, its age was deemed equal to the sum of its two direct ancestors' ages. Legend whispered that, occasionally, these Children of Fibonacci, rare as they were, would also become Chosen Primes\u2014blessed with a singular, indivisible essence. The elders maintained a sacred scroll listing every such illustrious being ever born, for these hybrids were highly sought after, both for their rarity and their balance within the mystical laws of Numeria.\n\nA prominent custom had formed in Numeria: whenever a young aspirant traveled to the Circle, they would present a request\u2014\u201cTell me the name of the Sage who stands at position N among all the Children who are both of Growth and Chosen.\u201d The seekers understood the specificity of the quest: given any positive number N, they would name the N-th child from their sacred scroll, ensuring that the child\u2019s birth order was counted strictly among only those with both heritages.\n\nAspirants would present their queries in the following tradition: they would bring a single integer, N, representing the place in the legendary list they wished to know about. The Seekers would then respond with the age, in Numerian years, of the sought-after hybrid. For scholars writing their own treatises, this interchange was summarized as a function titled \"prime_fib,\" which accepts N and returns the age of the N-th child who fits both ancient orders. For example, they might ask, \u201cprime_fib(1),\u201d and receive back 2\u2014the age of the first hybrid; or, \u201cprime_fib(4),\u201d and receive 13.\n\nTo foster education in the realm, the Seekers preserved a record of sample exchanges as follows:  \nIf the aspirant asked for the first hybrid\u2019s age, they received 2.  \nFor the second, 3.  \nFor the third, 5.  \nFor the fourth, 13.  \nFor the fifth, 89.  \nEach of these numbers represented an age that both derived from the Sequence of Growth and was marked by the uniqueness of a Chosen Prime.\n\nAnd so, with every inquisitor\u2019s visit, the Seekers would search the unfolding Sequence of Growth\u2014examining each new child, testing whether their age was uniquely indivisible\u2014and note each hybrid in succession, ever prepared to fulfill any such request as efficiently and completely as Numerian tradition allowed.",

If any number in this range divides the number evenly, the function returns False, indicating the number is not prime. If no such number is found, the function returns True, indicating the number is prime.\n\n`fib` calculates the nth Fibonacci number by iteratively updating two variables, a and b, to the next Fibonacci number in each iteration.\n\nIn the main function `prime_fib`, we start from the first Fibonacci number and keep generating Fibonacci numbers until we have found n prime Fibonacci numbers. We increment a counter each time we find a prime Fibonacci number. When the counter reaches n, we return the current Fibonacci number.\n",

It keeps track of the number of primes found and returns the nth prime Fibonacci number when n is 0.\n\nPlease note that this solution is not optimized for large inputs of n, as it uses a naive recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence, which has a high time complexity.

The `prime_fib` function generates Fibonacci numbers and checks if they are prime, storing them in a list until the list reaches the desired length `n`. The function then returns the last element of the list, which is the `n`th Fibonacci number that is also prime.\n",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeria, renowned for its enigmatic Guild of Arithmetic Artisans, a new challenge circulates among aspiring apprentices. Within the vibrant halls of the guild, young sages gather each day, each holding a pouch of number-stones\u2014smooth pebbles, each inscribed with a whole number. Legends whisper that if three distinct stones are brought together whose numbers blend into perfect zero, a hidden chamber of the guild will open, bestowing wisdom upon the finder. But not every collection yields such a magical trio, so the guild challenges its students: determine, with each new pouch, whether such a trio lies within.\n\nTo uphold the guild\u2019s traditions, the stones in each apprentice\u2019s pouch are all unique in position, and three different stones must be chosen\u2014no repeats allowed. Each stone bears its integer\u2014possibly positive, possibly negative, or even the serene neutrality of zero itself. The council has decreed that students must assess, for every pouch, whether three individual stones exist so that the sum of their numbers balances perfectly at zero. Only three stones may mix their numbers at a time, and they must all be distinct.\n\nSo it is the guild\u2019s custom to perform this assessment for every candidate\u2019s pouch presented, testing whether the zero-trio can be conjured from the stones at hand. The apprentice must swiftly judge each offering: do there exist three different stones whose numbers, when revealed together, cancel each other out entirely? If so, the apprentice should shout \u201cTrue\u201d and earn praise; if not, then \u201cFalse\u201d marks their turn.\n\nTo aid apprentices in their trials, the Guild of Arithmetic Artisans provides the following ritual procedure: They announce the numbers inscribed on the stones of a pouch, for example, by presenting a list of numbers. The apprentice must respond by revealing whether a zero-trio exists: the answer should be either True, if three different stones add neatly to zero, or False, if such a combination is impossible.\n\nFor instance, when one apprentice presented the pouch [1, 3, 5, 0], the guild found no such magical trio, and so the answer was False. Another, with [1, 3, -2, 1], had three stones\u2014specifically, the numbers 1, 3, and -2\u2014that wove their magic and balanced to zero, so the answer was True. Similarly, [1, 2, 3, 7] yielded no such trio, and so the verdict was False; but [2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7] did, as 2, 4, and -6 would not, but 2, 3, and -5 do, and so the answer was True. Pouches with fewer than three stones, such as [1], could not ever assemble a zero-trio, so False was returned.\n\nThus, through cunning and careful selection of stones, each apprentice learns to unravel the mystery of the zero-trio. The trials continue, echoing through the halls of Numeria, as centuries of future sages hone their skills with every stone-strewn challenge.",

Then, for each number in the list, it uses two pointers to find a triplet that sums to zero. The left pointer starts after the current number and the right pointer starts at the end of the list. If the sum of the current number and the numbers at the left and right pointers is less than zero, it means the sum is too small, so it increments the left pointer. If the sum is greater than zero, it means the sum is too large, so it decrements the right pointer. If the sum is exactly zero, it returns True. If no triplet is found, it returns False.\n",

        "question_content": "Long ago, in the boundless realm of Autovia, there lay a legendary highway known as the Line Eternal, a road so impossibly straight and endless that even the bravest drivers could not glimpse its end. Along this fabled path, there was an ancient tradition: the Order of the Wind would select a number of skilled racers\u2014let\u2019s call this number the mark of the challenge, denoted amongst the order\u2019s scrolls as **N**. Once chosen, these N racers would thunder forth from the wild eastern horizon, driving west with hearts full of daring. Simultaneously, another proud band of N intrepid souls would roar from the western edge, their wheels set on a path straight to the east.  \n\nNow, though these two forces began miles and miles apart, their destinies were entwined. Each racer drove at precisely the same unyielding speed\u2014neither side gaining ground on the other. And in the traditions of the Order, it was decreed: whenever the path of a west-bound charioteer intersected with that of an east-bound champion, a mighty encounter would occur. Yet, enchanted by Autovia\u2019s magic, their vehicles were invulnerable: at each crossing, the racers would pass through each other as ghosts might, never slowing, never changing course, continuing to race as if nothing had happened.\n\nThe wise Masters of the Order cherished the chronicle of these mystical encounters. For every single pairing\u2014each time a west-bound crossed paths with an east-bound\u2014a momentary collision of destinies was recorded, marked as a celebration of the spirit of the Line Eternal. The challenge placed by the Masters was simple in design but grand in scope: **given a tale that tells the number N, determine and proclaim precisely how many such stellar encounters\u2014the collisions\u2014will be commemorated on this day of the great race.** You must do so efficiently, even when the number N is vast, for the highway endures with no end, and so must your calculation.\n\nFor the scrolls of the Order, the recounting must be clear. Each tale that arrives tells, on its first line, the number of races planned. For each telling, the number N is announced upon a line, and after considering the cosmic dance of the carriages, the Master scribes must return, in reply, a single number upon its own line: the total count of all magnificent collisions that occur.\n\nImagine, for example, a day when the Masters are told in three separate tales: first, that 1 participant from the east will meet 1 from the west; second, that 2 from each direction will contend; and third, that 3 champions will ride forth from both dawn and dusk. The scribes would chronicle these events as follows:\n\n**Input:**\n```\n3\n1\n2\n3\n```\n\u2014where the first number reveals the count of tales (here, 3), and each following line reveals the number N for that tale.\n\n**Output:**\n```\n1\n4\n9\n```\n\u2014for in the first legend, but a single pairing bravely crosses paths; in the second, the strength of each pair grows to four crossings; and in the third, nine mighty encounters are made.\n\nThus, by command of the Order, the scribes recite: for every day\u2019s race, and for each value N, record the number of meetings made, which in the tongue of the statisticians is the result of N times N. Thus concludes the chronicle of the infinite collisions upon the Line Eternal.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient archipelago of Numera, the inhabitants cherished a peculiar tradition involving magical stones. Each citizen owned a collection of stones, each stone etched with a unique number, representing its age-old power. Every gathering in the islands began with a curious ritual: each stone\u2019s strength had to be increased by one\u2014a symbolic act believed to invite fortune for the coming season. The elders closely observed this tradition, ensuring no stone was forgotten nor outshone, for harmony lay in collective growth, not isolated might.\n\nLife on Numera flowed with certain customs. Any villager\u2014child or elder\u2014could bring forth a collection of stones, their numbers as varied and abundant as the sands upon Numera\u2019s shores. Whether a villager carried a trove of nine stately stones or just three humble ones, none faced restriction; the tradition welcomed any such bounty, with all numbers, whether small as zero or grand as one hundred twenty-three or higher, being equally revered and eligible for the ritual.\n\nThe ceremony was simple but had only one unbreakable rule: each stone must be touched only once, bestowing upon it just a single extra spark of power. The villagers desired efficiency, for as the island\u2019s riches grew, so did the number of stones. Thus, their goal was always to finish the ritual as swiftly and completely as possible\u2014never missing a stone, never adding more than one extra strength per stone, and always presenting the improved collection by the close of the gathering.\n\nNow, when a visiting scribe wished to archive the ritual for distant lands, she codified the process as follows: anyone could approach her with a list of stone strengths (written as consecutive numbers separated by commas within square brackets, for clarity). She would then promptly record the enhanced stone strengths, each one raised by exactly one, keeping the order intact, and return it in the same list format. For instance, if the scribe received `[1, 2, 3]`, she would mark their new strengths as `[2, 3, 4]`. Likewise, if a villager arrived panting beneath a bundle of stones marked `[5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`, the scribe would respond with the hallowed tally: `[6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]`.\n\nEach chiseled record thus reflected the tradition\u2019s requirements: all original numbers neatly advanced by just one mark. Through this discipline, the islanders kept alive their treasured ritual\u2014ensuring every stone, be it ancient or newly carved, gleamed a little brighter with the dawn. And so, the ledger of Numera\u2019s stones would ever show not just the present strength, but the promise of one step beyond.",

The Additonics believe that when two complementary stones are paired\u2014one holding a positive force and the other a negative of equal magnitude\u2014a perfect balance is struck, and peace blesses their land. However, such a harmony cannot be achieved if only one type of stone or none of the complements exist.\n\nThe Council of Sums, the sages of Numeria, crafted strict laws for these gatherings. Each ceremony begins with a scroll detailing the order and faces of stones the Numerians have brought, with every stone's value recorded precisely. For the ritual to restore harmony, the Additonics decree that two **distinct** stones must be found whose forces, when combined, neutralize each other and return the balance to zero. Should the ceremony present only one stone, or should no such pair exist, the blessing cannot be granted.\n\nYour task, as the new Attendant of Sums, is to receive the scroll bearing the list of stone values\u2014one list for each day\u2014and to swiftly decide: can the Numerians that day offer a harmonious pair of stones that together bring the balance to zero? Put plainly, you must examine the provided sequence and declare, \"Yes, harmony is possible!\" or \"No, balance remains unstruck,\" depending on the stones at hand. You must make this proclamation as efficiently as Numerian traditions demand, for their patience is short, and the cycles countless.\n\nEach scroll arrives before you in a precise format: a line listing the values of the number-stones in order. You must study the entire procession of stones and then, considering all possible pairings of two distinct stones, decide if any two of them sum to zero. Your declaration shall be in the ancient Numerian tongue: \"True,\" should such a matching pair exist, and \"False,\" should none be found. This verdict is all the Additonics require for the day's ritual and will be recorded on the day\u2019s ledger.\n\nLet us look at some episodes from Numerian chronicles. If the procession is marked as [1, 3, 5, 0], the answer is \"False,\" for no two stones combine to reach zero; a lone zero stone does not pair. If the list is [2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7], then indeed, stones of five and negative five stand ready, and thus the answer is \"True.\" When only a single stone is presented, as with [1], no pairing is possible, and \"False\" is spoken.\n\nAnd so, oh Attendant of Sums, heed well your role: read the scroll, scan the stones, and declare \u201cTrue\u201d if balance can be achieved by any pairing, or \u201cFalse\u201d otherwise. Always use care, for the harmony of Numeria depends upon your wise and swift judgments.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling land of Numeralis, every number was a citizen with its own story. Each town in Numeralis, known as a \"base,\" had its own secret language\u2014a way of writing the deeds and identity of its citizens with symbols drawn only from a finite collection, never more than the digits from zero up to one less than the town\u2019s number. The town council had long decreed that no base in Numeralis could use ten or more unique symbols, for fear of confusion and chaos.\n\nWhenever a newcomer arrived in Numeralis, they came holding a plaque engraved in the Unibase tongue\u2014mere decimal\u2014the only language spoken at the gates. But to live and thrive among the townsfolk, each had to have their plaque rewritten in the native script of their chosen town. For instance, the citizen known as eight in Unibase needed their story retold in the symbols cherished by the inhabitants of Base-3 or Base-2, using only the digits zero, one, and two for the former and zero and one for the latter.\n\nThe challenge offered to traveling scribes was clear: for any newcomer\u2019s entry, represented by an integer plaque and the number of the destination town (always less than ten), transform the original plaque into its full story told in that town\u2019s chosen language, expressing the number solely with locally-accepted symbols. The function of the scribe, called into action with two figures\u2014first, the original Unibase number; second, the base of the destination town\u2014must always return the true narrative as a string, capturing the newcomer\u2019s identity as understood by all that town\u2019s denizens.\n\nScribes submitted their works in the form:  \n`change_base(number_in_unibase, destination_town_base)`  \nand received the completed local plaque in return as a string. For example, when a scribe wrote:  \n`change_base(8, 3)`  \nthe result brought forth was `'22'`, for that was how the townsfolk of Base-3 celebrated the journey of eight across their hillsides. Similarly,  \n`change_base(8, 2)`  \nyielded `'1000'`, marking eight\u2019s arrival in the binary borough, and  \n`change_base(7, 2)`  \ngave `'111'`, the legendary name for seven among the villagers of Base-2.\n\nEach tale above demonstrates the art of translation within Numeralis: not only must the transformation obey the strict alphabet of the destination base (never exceeding the count of nine), but it must be performed as expertly and as succinctly as possible, preserving every nuance of the emigrant\u2019s original identity. And so, scribes moved through the towns, guided by the rule that every story, no matter how grand or humble, would find itself perfectly told, in the words and numerals of its chosen new home.",

It then reverses the list and joins the elements together into a string. This gives the number in the desired base.\n\nFor example, if we call `change_base(8, 3)`, the function will return `'22'`. This is because 8 in base 10 is 22 in base 3.\n\nSimilarly, if we call `change_base(8, 2)`, the function will return `'1000'`. This is because 8 in base 10 is 1000 in base 2.\n\nAnd if we call `change_base(7, 2)`, the function will return `'111'`. This is because 7 in base 10 is 111 in base 2.\n",

The method first checks if the base is valid (between 2 and 9). If the base is valid, it then converts the number to the specified base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and appending the remainder to a list. The list is then reversed and joined into a string to form the final result.\n",

The function `change_base` takes two arguments: `x`, the number to be converted, and `base`, the base to which `x` should be converted. If `x` is less than `base`, it directly converts `x` to a string and returns it. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `x // base` and `base` as arguments, and appends the remainder of `x // base` modulo `base` to the result. This process continues until `x` is less than `base`. The result is then returned as a string.\n",

The digits are represented by a string `digits` that contains the digits from 0 to `base - 1`. The result is built up by appending the digit corresponding to the remainder of the division of `x` by `base` to the beginning of `result`. The `x` is then updated to be the integer division of `x` by `base`. This process is repeated until `x` becomes 0. The function returns `result` as the string representation of the number in the desired base.\n",

        "question_content": "In the mystical kingdom of Geometrica, there is a time-honored tradition among the architects and builders. Whenever a new structure is planned, the Royal Council demands precise calculations, for they believe the land\u2019s harmony depends upon perfect forms and proportional spaces. Nowhere is this truer than in the design of triangular gardens, which must adhere to strict specifications passed down through generations.\n\nLegend has it that to gain the Council\u2019s favor, a builder must present two values: first, the straight length of the garden\u2019s chosen base, and second, the vertical distance rising from this base up to the garden\u2019s tallest point (they call this the \u2018high\u2019, a term rooted in ancient Geometrican tongue). The Council requires that both these numbers be real and positive\u2014after all, no one plants a garden of negative breadth or height!\n\nThe council\u2019s secret for determining how much land the garden will cover is almost magical in its simplicity: they advise that one takes half of the product of the base\u2019s length and the garden\u2019s towering vertical measure. In plain terms, for any base and height that a hopeful gardener describes in their scroll, the area is computed as if conjured: by multiplying the two, then taking precisely half of whatever result appears. \n\nAspiring garden planners are summoned to recite these values to the Council\u2019s Grand Scribe, who records them in order\u2014first the garden\u2019s base, then its high. The Scribe, skilled in the numerological arts, then announces the enchanted area they\u2019ll need to prepare\u2014always as one solitary number, representing the units of ground the garden will command.\n\nFor instance, when the builder Tilda once declared a base length of five and a high of three, the Scribe quickly multiplied these, finding fifteen, then incanted the ancient dividing spell to reveal the answer: seven and a half. So, Tilda was told, her garden would span exactly seven and a half square cubits on the royal land.\n\nThus, each aspiring builder presents two numbers\u2014base and high\u2014upon entry, and receives a single number in return: the precise area required for their triangular masterpiece. As in Tilda\u2019s case, when the base was five and the high three, the garden\u2019s expanse was seven point five. This sacred method\u2014base and high in, area out\u2014remains the unwavering law of the land, ensuring every triangular garden in Geometrica is perfectly planned for the ages.",

        "question_content": "In the legendary Realm of Numeria, wizened sages chronicled numerous magical sequences, each with its own law and significance. Among these, the most curious was the Chrono-Quadra Sequence\u2014a series of mystical energies that pulsed through time, shaping the very fabric of Numerian magic. Unlike its more famous cousin, the Golden Spiral (known to outsiders as the Fibonacci sequence), this sequence drew its power from the convergence of four prior moments, weaving a tapestry both subtle and formidable.\n\nIt was said that in the first four hours after dawn, the wells of Numerian power lay nearly dormant. The first and second hours yielded no energy at all, the third delivered a surge of two droplets, and the fourth returned once more to silence. Thereafter, every hour\u2019s strength was not born of its own, but borrowed: each was the sum of the magical energies accumulated during the prior four hours. This custom was codified by Numerian scribes as tradition, and none in the realm questioned its fairness or logic. It was, after all, the law of time itself.\n\nYoung acolytes of Numeria, seeking to understand the Chrono-Quadra Sequence, were often presented with a challenge: \u201cGiven any hour of the day, can you swiftly and without arcane recursion, divine the total energy that pulses through Numeria at that hour?\u201d The process meant they could only look back at recordings of previous energies\u2014no anticipating the future, no peering into the void. Full efficiency was prized: sages always desired the answer as rapidly as possible, without redundant enchantments or wasteful steps.\n\nThe tradition dictated the input and output of such queries. When a sage posed a challenge, the acolyte received a scroll marked with a single integer\u2014representing the hour since dawn at which the energy was to be measured. In response, the acolyte was to inscribe a single integer\u2014the amount of mystical energy at that precise hour.  Practiced acolytes mastered writing the function as:  `fib4(number_of_hours)`, returning a value that reflected the energy of Numeria at that moment.\n\nTo illustrate, a sage might ask, \u201cAt the fifth hour since dawn, what is the magic in the air?\u201d The acolyte would answer promptly: \u201cFour droplets, master.\u201d Similarly, if inquired about the sixth hour, the response would be \u201cEight,\u201d and for the seventh, \u201cFourteen.\u201d In each case, the acolyte ensured their calculation honored the ancient law: every hour\u2019s magic was exactly the sum of the energies from the four preceding hours, and the earliest hours held only what was decreed by tradition.\n\nThus, the lore of Numeria preserved itself, not just as a curiosity, but as a ritual of logic, memory, and mastery\u2014reminding all that sometimes, power lies not in the moment, but in the mindful summation of the past.",

        "question_content": "In the heart of the ancient city of Numeris, there existed a peculiar guild known as the Mediators. These wise arbiters had a singular and sacred role: whenever a council of villagers brought them a collection of tokens\u2014each marked with distinct numbers from the daily harvest, fortunes, or omens\u2014they were tasked with finding the true \"middle spirit\" of the gathering. It was believed that this middle spirit, once revealed, could guide important village decisions with perfect balance and fairness.\n\nCustom dictated exactly how the Mediators must proceed. When presented with their sealed pouch of tokens (which could contain any number of marks, so long as there was at least one), the Mediators would empty them onto their tally table and line them up in perfect numeric order, from the smallest token to the greatest. If the council\u2019s offering contained an odd number of tokens, the central token in this lineup was revered as the sole bearer of the middle spirit, and its number was announced to all. However, if there were an even number of tokens, the Mediators would honor both central tokens equally: they would blend their numbers together by calculating the average\u2014adding them and dividing by two\u2014to reveal the true spirit of balance.\n\nThus, the Mediators\u2019 task, recast in their own specialized tradition, was: given a written scroll listing all the council's tokens as numbers (received in any order), they must return either the middle number or\u2014if there was a tie for the center\u2014the mean of the two innermost numbers after sorting. If the answer was a whole number, only that number was spoken. If the answer was not a whole number, the village scribe would record it as a floating spirit: a number with a fractional part.\n\nTo communicate with Mediators far and wide, the guild devised a method anyone could use: a single function named \"median,\" which would accept a list of numbers, just as it arrived from the council, and whisper back the middle spirit\u2019s value\u2014an integer or a float as required. The villagers would present their lists according to this input format: simply a list of numbers within brackets. The output was the middle value itself, as determined by the tokens\u2019 ancient ritual.\n\nFor example, should the council send the following set of tokens\u2014[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]\u2014the Mediators would first arrange them as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. With five tokens, the one in the very center carried the middle spirit, hence the result would be three. In another instance, with tokens marked [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20], arranging them yielded [-10, 4, 6, 10, 20, 1000]. Here, the middle lay between the third and fourth tokens: six and ten. By the guild\u2019s rites, they were blended, summing to sixteen and halved for an answer of eight\u2014but, realizing an error in the villagers\u2019 recount, a correction revealed the sum was sixteen, and thus the answer is eight. (Note: In the original constraint, the correct example sum yields fifteen, as six plus ten equals sixteen, divided by two is eight; however, the given example in the code yields fifteen\u2014the sum of six and ten is sixteen, divided by two is eight, but the docstring says fifteen, which could be an error.)\n\nIn closing, the city of Numeris still follows this sacred tradition, ensuring peace, balance, and wisdom in every decision. By observing these rules through the median function, the guild ensures fairness reigns, guided not by magic but by unerring mathematics shrouded in honored ritual.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient realm of Writewell, the master archivists valued harmony and symmetry above all else. Within their grand library, they cherished messages\u2014those precious sequences of letters whispered across kingdoms\u2014only if these could be read identically forwards and backwards, a rare property they called The Palindromic Balance. There, every document was carefully reviewed under magical lanterns that would reveal, at a glance, whether the words ran perfectly symmetrical, mirroring one another from beginning to end.\n\nAmong the archivists, a special ritual governed the assessment of each message: if the parchment lay empty, the silence itself was considered supremely balanced\u2014after all, nothing disturbs perfect symmetry. If the script, when read from leftmost to rightmost rune, matched exactly with the counter-route from rightmost to leftmost, the message was declared harmonious. Failure to achieve this symmetry, even in a single mark, categorized the message as asymmetrical, hence forbidden from the palace archives.\n\nHere is how the ritual worked: a scribe would present a single string of characters\u2014this being the message whose balance was to be tested. The head archivist would then read in both directions, comparing each corresponding pair of symbols, one from the start and one from the end, progressing toward the center. If every pair matched, the lanterns would glow a gentle green, signaling a Palindromic Balance. Any mismatch, however, caused the lanterns to flicker a distressing red, warning of non-symmetry.\n\nTo formalize the judgment, the scholars demanded a decisive answer: the archivist must declare \u201cTrue\u201d if the message radiated perfect symmetry, or \u201cFalse\u201d if any dissonance was detected. This singular declaration was their sacred output, corresponding to each message offered as input. Thus, the archivists\u2019 magic could be described in their chronicles as a function, which could be performed upon receiving a message parchment, returning a proclamation of its palindromic nature, succinctly stated as \u201cTrue\u201d or \u201cFalse.\u201d\n\nIn their illuminated records, several examples stood as guidance for future generations. When a messenger offered an empty parchment, the archivist, following the ancient doctrine, would return True\u2014nothing is more balanced than silence. A script bearing the word \u201caba\u201d would also evoke a True, as \u201caba\u201d reads identically whether the script is followed forwards or backwards. Long scrolls filled entirely with repeating characters, such as \u201caaaaa,\u201d also exemplified perfect harmony. Yet, when strange scripts such as \u201czbcd\u201d were examined, the archivist\u2019s solemn answer would be False\u2014these runes held no symmetry under the lanterns\u2019 light.\n\nThus, the seekers of balance in Writewell learned to submit their strings to the archivists, who would process their offering as input\u2014a sequence of characters\u2014and return a verdict of True if the Palindromic Balance was achieved, or False if it was not. By following this venerable ritual, the library ensured that only the world\u2019s most harmonious messages would be enshrined for all eternity.",

        "question_content": "Certainly! Here is your coding problem fully transformed within a narrative story format, incorporating all your guidelines:\n\n---\n\nIn the tranquil realm of Numeria, ancient sages and curious arithmancers sought ways to measure the power coursing through their arcane crystal towers. Each tower drew its strength from the fabled \u201cBinary Wellspring,\u201d whose energy grew by doubling at every interval. But power unchecked could summon calamity, and so each province maintained a strict limit, enforced by magical wards set to a prime number.\n\nEvery arithmancer was well-versed in the laws governing these energies: when a young apprentice sought to construct a burst of energy, they would start with the smallest flicker\u2014merely a single spark\u2014and then double it, again and again, as many times as commanded by the order\u2019s records. But there was a caveat: this doubling ritual, repeated time and again, eventually became so vast that it threatened to overwhelm the province\u2019s wards. To keep this energy from running rampant, the elders decreed that the strength in the towers must always be displayed as the remainder left after dividing the total burst by the prime number protecting the gates.\n\nHence, arithmancers faced recurring trials: given the number of times to double the spark, and the value of the prime ward set by the province, report the final burst strength as protected by the magical boundary. This challenge was always spelled out for every initiation: each student would be given two integers; the first was the number of times to double (which could be as great as one with five zeroes trailing behind), and the second was the strength of the warding prime (never less than one nor greater than a hundred times itself plus one). Their task: deduce how much power the crystals could hold, after the prime ward had been applied, and return that value for their records.\n\nFor the ritual, the magical logbook recorded the input as two numbers written on a scroll\u2014first, the count of doublings, and then the power of the protective ward. The answer would be a single integer: the \u201cburst strength\u201d left in the crystal, neither exceeding nor breaking the boundaries set by the ward.\n\nMany legendary tales were inscribed in the arithmancers\u2019 codices. When an apprentice set out to channel three doublings through a ward of five, the crystal\u2019s final light glimmered just thrice\u2014since doubling three times built the spark to eight, but the ward allowed only the remnant after five was spent, leaving three. Once, a grandmaster attempted one thousand and one doublings beneath a ward of one hundred and one; though the numbers were unfathomable, the remainder was recorded as two. Every so often a novice, starting with zero doublings and a ward of one hundred and one, found the spark unchanged, for the minimum power was always one. Other combinations, such as three doublings with a ward of eleven, resulted in eight, or one hundred doublings protected by a ward of one hundred and one, which miraculously looped the energy cycle perfectly and restored the original spark.\n\nIn summary, any problem in Numeria was always phrased with two numbers as input\u2014the count of doublings and the ward\u2019s strength\u2014as in:  \n`3 5`  \nor  \n`1101 101`  \nand so on. The answer for each trial would be a single number\u2014the burst strength after the great division and protection rituals. Echoing the stories, if you read:  \n`3 5`  \nthe answer you would be expected to recite would be:  \n`3`  \nIf you saw:  \n`1101 101`  \nthe answer would be:  \n`2`  \nIf you saw:  \n`0 101`  \nthe answer would be:  \n`1`  \nAnd each tale in the logbook would similarly relate the numbers through Numeria\u2019s wondrous logic.",

This function is used to ensure that the power does not exceed the ward's strength.\n\nThen, in the `finalBurstStrength` function, we start with a power of 1 (since a single spark is the starting point). We then double the power for the number of times specified by the `doublings` parameter.

This function uses a for loop to double the spark the correct number of times, and then applies the modulus operation to the result. The modulus operation ensures that the burst strength does not exceed the ward's strength.\n\nThe `modp` function is used to handle the case where the spark becomes larger than the ward's strength. This is because in Python, the `%` operator returns a result that has the same sign as the divisor, not the dividend. Therefore, to ensure that the result is always non-negative, we add the divisor to the result before taking the modulus.\n\nFinally, we return the final burst strength.\n",

The third argument, `p`, is the modulus. The function calculates the power of `2` modulo `p`, which is equivalent to calculating `2` to the power of `n` modulo `p`. This is a common technique in number theory to calculate large powers modulo a prime number efficiently.\n",

        "question_content": "Long ago, in the bustling market city of Numeria, merchants prided themselves on the unique way they displayed their wares. Rather than simply laying out their goods in a row, these traders adhered to an age-old custom: every two precious items placed side by side on their velvet stalls had to be separated by a special token. This token, always the same for a given day, was known as the Delimiter Gem\u2014a symbol of unity and order, valued as much as any trade good. On quieter days, a merchant with no wares set out would simply present an empty stall, and no Delimiter Gem would be used.\n\nThe rules of the Numerian market were clear. Whenever a merchant arranged their items for sale, they would carefully insert a Delimiter Gem between each and every pair of consecutive objects. No gem graced the beginning or end of the row, only the spaces between items, as tradition required. Merchants could choose any sequence of treasures to display\u2014be it a handful or a thousand, as long as each was a single indivisible item. The Delimiter Gem for the day remained the same, decided at dawn and known to all.\n\nEach morning, a town crier would collect two pieces of information from the merchants: the full list of goods intended for display, in the precise order they wished to lay them out, and the special value of that day's Delimiter Gem. The crier would then instruct the merchants on how to arrange their stalls according to Numerian custom, ensuring every display was as harmonious and orderly as possible.\n\nTo illustrate, the crier might receive a request such as: \u201cWith goods numbered one, two, and three, and the day's Delimiter Gem valued at four, how should the merchant arrange their display?\u201d The answer would be to place the goods in order, inserting a Delimiter Gem of value four between each pair\u2014resulting in a sequence like this: a one, then a four, then a two, then another four, and finally a three.\n\nIf, on a rare occasion, a merchant came forward with no items to sell, the crier would announce that the stall should remain empty\u2014no Delimiter Gems required, and nothing to arrange. In every case, the goal was always the same: to follow Numerian tradition with utmost precision, placing Delimiter Gems exactly where required\u2014no more, no less.\n\n**Input and Output in Numeria:**  \nEach arrangement begins with a list of integers representing the merchant\u2019s goods (possibly empty), followed by the value of the Delimiter Gem for the day. The crier\u2019s response is the properly arranged sequence for the stall, as a list of integers showing both the goods and the Delimiter Gems in their exact order. For example:\n\n- When no goods are brought (`[]`, Delimiter Gem `4`), the stall remains empty: `[]`.\n- When the goods are `[1, 2, 3]` and the Delimiter Gem is `4`, the stall displays: `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]`.\n\nAnd so, the Numerian market flourished, its orderly displays a symbol of the city\u2019s wisdom\u2014and all thanks to the steadfast logic of the Delimiter Gem.",

Beneath the city\u2019s clockwork towers lies the secret society of the Letterwrights, renowned artisans who mastered the ancient art of shifting speech. For generations, their work has protected citizens\u2019 most sensitive words from prying ears, all thanks to their sacred cipher: the Cycle of Five.\n\nEvery Letterwright apprentice learns the immutable tradition by which their society encrypts language. When a message arrives for encoding, each letter undergoes a ceremonial procession forward through the Circle of Letters, with every step marking one place forward in the alphabet. The ritual demands that every letter be advanced exactly five paces ahead, wrapping around to the beginning of the circle if the edge is reached\u2014so 'a' finds itself becoming 'f', and 'v' journeys forward to become 'a' anew. As part of the sacred trust, messages always come written only with lowercase letters of the common alphabet, with no stray symbols nor numbers to offend the rituals.\n\nThe Master Letterwright gives each apprentice a clear directive: any time a message comes forth (represented as a string of only lowercase letters, which you, the apprentice, must process), you are to craft a new scroll bearing the encoded message. This is done by shifting every letter forward by five places, strictly in accordance with the Cycle\u2019s customs. Later, if a messenger arrives with a scroll already ciphered in this fashion, you are to perform the reverse ceremony\u2014each letter steps backward by five\u2014to unveil the original script. In every process, the input is always a lone string, and your returned answer must be another lone string, reflecting the encoded (or decoded) message.\n\nTo demonstrate their craft, the Letterwrights often present examples for budding apprentices. Should a message of 'abc' arrive, the proper transformation\u2014by the shifting cycle\u2014reveals 'fgh'. If a scroll encoded with 'fgh' is brought for deciphering, the reverse ceremony uncovers 'abc' once again. Each scroll must be considered and delivered in these exact formats: a single line showing the secret message before and after transformation.\n\nThus, the Cycle of Five persists, binding Codetropolis\u2019 words in shifting mystery. The society\u2019s purpose remains clear: preserve the privacy of the city\u2019s secrets by faithfully encoding and revealing messages with the discipline and clarity demanded by their ancient traditions, as illustrated in these examples. So when the next scroll lands in your hands, remember the rites, perform the shift, and keep the secrets of the city safe.",

If the character is an alphabet, it subtracts 5 from its ASCII value and adds 26 if the result is less than 'e'. If the character is not an alphabet, it is added to the decoded string as is. The `encode_shift` method does the opposite: it adds 5 to the ASCII value of each alphabet character and subtracts 26 if the result is greater than 'w'. For non-alphabet characters, they are added to the encoded string as is.\n",

The `decode_shift` method takes a string `s` as input and returns the decoded string. The `encode_shift` method takes a string `s` as input and returns the encoded string.\n\nIn both methods, we iterate over each character in the input string. If the character is an alphabet, we shift it forward or backward by 5 places depending on whether we are encoding or decoding. If the character is not an alphabet, we leave it as it is.\n\nThe `ord` function is used to get the ASCII value of a character and `chr` function is used to get the character represented by a specific ASCII value.\n\nThe test cases at the end of the code demonstrate that the methods work correctly.\n",

Both methods take a string `s` as input and return a new string where each character in `s` is shifted 5 places in the alphabet. The `decode_shift` method shifts characters 5 places to the left, while `encode_shift` shifts characters 5 places to the right. Non-alphabetic characters are not modified.\n\nThe code uses the `ord` function to get the ASCII value of a character, and the `chr` function to get the character represented by a specific ASCII value. The `isalpha` method is used to check if a character is a letter. The `islower` method is used to determine if a letter is lowercase or uppercase.\n\nThe shift is performed by subtracting 5 from the ASCII value of a character (taking into account whether the character is lowercase or uppercase), taking the modulus of 26 to wrap around the alphabet, and then adding the ASCII value of 'a' or 'A' again to get the correct ASCII value for the shifted character.\n",

The `encode_shift` method takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string where each character in `s` is shifted forward by 5 places in the alphabet. The `decode_shift` method takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string where each character in `s` is shifted backward by 5 places in the alphabet. The program then creates an instance of the `Solution` class and tests the `encode_shift` and `decode_shift` methods with the string \"abc\".\n",

If the character is a letter, it gets its ASCII value and checks if it's within the range of lowercase or uppercase letters. Then it checks if the ASCII value of the character is within the range of the last 5 letters in the alphabet. If it is, it subtracts 5 from the ASCII value to get the original character. If it's not, it adds 21 to the ASCII value to wrap around to the start of the alphabet. If the character is not a letter, it's added to the decoded string as is.\n",

These methods take a string `s` as input and return the decoded or encoded string. The `decode_shift` method decodes the encoded string by shifting each character 5 places backward in the alphabet, while the `encode_shift` method encodes the input string by shifting each character 5 places forward in the alphabet. Non-alphabetic characters are not modified.\n",

If the character is a letter, it gets its ASCII value and checks if it falls within the range of lowercase or uppercase letters. Depending on the case, it shifts the character 5 positions to the right or 21 positions to the left. If the character is not a letter, it is added to the result string as is. The function returns the result string, which is the decoded message.\n",

If the character is a letter, it calculates the ASCII value of the character and subtracts 5 from it. If the resulting ASCII value is less than the ASCII value of 'a' or 'A', it wraps around to the end of the alphabet by adding 26. The resulting ASCII value is then converted back to a character using the `chr` function and added to the decoded string. If the character is not a letter, it is added to the decoded string as is.\n\nHere is how you can use this solution:\n\n```python\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.decode_shift(\"abc\"))  # Output: \"fgh\"\nprint(solution.decode_shift(\"fgh\"))  # Output: \"abc\"\n```\n",

The method takes a string `s` as input and returns a string where each character in `s` is shifted 5 places to the left in the alphabet. Non-alphabet characters are left unchanged. The shift wraps around the alphabet, so 'z' becomes 'u' and 'Z' becomes 'V'.\n\nThe code works by iterating over each character in the input string.

        "question_content": "In a distant land known as Wordinia, scrolls and letters whispered the lifeblood of its societies. Every sentence, name, and proclamation flowed from the grand Library Hall, which archived every utterance from the kingdom\u2019s history. Yet, within these written treasures, there existed secret forces\u2014certain singing spirits known as \u201cVovels.\u201d These Vovels (their names were Aeye, Ee, Iye, Oh, and You, in both regal and humble tongues) held a gentle magic: wherever they appeared in text, they softened meaning and brought melody. Occasionally, however, people longed for plainness and clarity, requesting that all the Vovels be whisked away, leaving behind only the unembellished skeletons of meaning.\n\nThere were customs and laws in Wordinia to guide this peculiar request. When a citizen wished to see what a message looked like without any melodic Vovels\u2014be it a simple word, an epic poem, or even a scroll filled with line breaks\u2014the scribes would carefully follow the Royal Decree: remove A, E, I, O, U, and their twin noble forms (A, E, I, O, U), wherever they lurked, but allow all consonant characters, symbols, numbers, and spaces to retain their place. Even the invisible jumps between lines (the line breaks) were to be respected, for they too carried meaning in the parchment. Though sometimes the result was a bare parchment, with all melody stripped away, it was considered proper.\n\nTo grant this service to every citizen, the kingdom's wizards developed a wondrous incantation, which they called \u201cremove_vowels.\u201d This spell\u2014when inscribed upon a scroll\u2014would accept a message (any arrangement of written symbols), and carefully transcribe the same message minus all references to the five Vovels, in either their small or grand attire. The decree was clear: *all* instances, wherever they nestled in the text, must vanish, leaving other symbols untouched. If a message arrived already without any Vovels, or if it was an emptiness itself, the answer was simply to echo it back exactly as seen\u2014be it silence or consonant song.\n\nTo employ this incantation, a writer must present the message as a string\u2014the customary sequence of glyphs in Wordinia. The result\u2014after the ritual\u2014is also a string, precisely the same arrangement but lacking the melodic Vovels. If lines existed within the message, these lines endured, their shapes respected through the changes.\n\nConsider the chronicles recorded by the kingdom\u2019s historians:\n- When an empty scroll (\u201c\u201d) was brought for purification, nothing was changed, and nothing remained.\n- A message inscribed \u201cabcdef\u201d upon a single page would return \u201cbcdf\u201d once the ceremonial removal was complete.\n- Should a lengthy scroll span two rows, such as \u201cabcdef\u201d (on the first row) and \u201cghijklm\u201d (on the next), the returned message would respect the division: \u201cbcdf\u201d on the top, \u201cghjklm\u201d on the lower parchment.\n- For a page filled only with the repeated singing of \u201ca\u201d (\u201caaaaa\u201d), silence greeted the reader when the Vovels left.\n- When a noble scroll contained both small and grand letters, such as \u201caaBAA,\u201d the result was only the lone consonant \u201cB,\u201d left standing amid the space where vowels had ruled.\n- And the line \u201czbcd,\u201d already lacking in melody, remained unchanged, as no Vovels dared to step upon it.\n\nThus, the \u201cremove_vowels\u201d incantation provided a most reliable service for the folk of Wordinia. Whenever citizens desired to see their messages without the ancient melodies, they called upon this function as described, sending forth their requests and receiving refined scripts in return\u2014swift, precise, and always respectful of the kingdom\u2019s enduring laws.",

        "question_content": "In the peaceful realm of Numeria, there existed a guild of wise Inspectors, entrusted with the responsibility of safeguarding the delicate balance of magical energies. Legend had it that, within Numeria\u2019s borders, magical stones pulsed with latent powers\u2014each stone possessing a measured aura, expressed in ancient units only understood by the keen Inspectors. The elders decreed a single guiding principle: should any stone\u2019s aura grow too potent, catastrophe could ensue for the kingdom.\n\nFor generations, the rule was clear. Whenever a new shipment of magical stones arrived at the kingdom\u2019s gates\u2014each shipment a collection of glowing orbs\u2014the Inspectors would perform their renowned \u201cThreshold Ceremony.\u201d The council would first declare a critical number for the day, a mystical limit known as the Royal Threshold. By sacred law, only stones whose powers remained modest and \u201cbelow the Royal Threshold\u201d were permitted to enter Numeria\u2019s vaults. Should even the meekest of stones dare to equal or surpass the set threshold, the shipment would be rejected without hesitation.\n\nAccording to the ancient records, the royal scribes meticulously logged shipments and thresholds. Each record detailed, in succession, the measured auras of the stones in a particular batch, followed by the Royal Threshold itself. The Inspectors\u2019 task was always the same: to scrutinize the shipment carefully and determine whether every single stone\u2014without exception\u2014possessed an aura strictly less than the day\u2019s proclaimed threshold. If so, a special seal, known as \u201cTrue,\u201d was bestowed upon the shipment, granting it entry. If not, the seal \u201cFalse\u201d would be inscribed, and the shipment returned.\n\nTo fulfill this duty, the Inspectors designed a ritual known as \u201cThe Test of the Below.\u201d The process demanded two ingredients: a recounting of the auras (a list of numbers, each representing a stone\u2019s power) and the day\u2019s Royal Threshold (a single number). Once these two elements were presented, the verdict would emerge: the proclamation would either be \u201cTrue\u201d (all stones are sufficiently weak) or \u201cFalse\u201d (at least one stone is too strong). This test became a cornerstone of Numerian bureaucracy.\n\nThe council preserved past cases for scholarly review. On the day when the stones arrived with the auras one, two, four, and ten, and the Royal Threshold was a mighty one hundred, the inspectors rejoiced: \u201cTrue,\u201d they declared, for each stone\u2019s power was but a whisper beneath the limit. Conversely, when another shipment came with the auras one, twenty, four, and ten, but the Royal Threshold was a modest five, despair filled the hall: since the stone marked twenty was far too potent, \u201cFalse\u201d was their ruling.\n\nThrough these venerable traditions, Numeria thrived, its vaults stocked only with shipments safely below the day\u2019s danger line\u2014a practice recalled in every ledger, where shipments and Royal Threshold are presented, and the words \u201cTrue\u201d or \u201cFalse\u201d echo as clear judgments through the ages.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling kingdom of Numeria, there resided a wise mathematician known as Sage Sumwell. Throughout the land, people often came to seek Sage Sumwell's guidance on matters involving quantities\u2014whether it be apples in a basket, coins in a coffer, or gems in a chest. Numeria prided itself on the clarity of its arithmetic lore, especially the revered ability to unite two collections into one grander whole.\n\nIn this land, every citizen knew that bringing together two distinct heaps\u2014be they stones, scrolls, or any other treasures\u2014meant counting out each item from the first, then each from the second, so that nothing would be lost or forgotten. Indeed, it was a core law of Numerian society: for every pair of treasured heaps, there was but one rightful way to determine how many treasures they all amounted to together.\n\nSage Sumwell's task was simple in its proclamation yet vital in its precision: whenever a Numerian came forward with the sizes of two collections, the Sage was to reveal the aggregate size of the unioned hoard. To do so, the Sage required the precise sizes of each group's treasures\u2014both being single whole numbers\u2014spoken to him in the ancient order, separated by a pause. Upon hearing these, he would pronounce the final count, a solitary number representing the sum.\n\nTo keep the record of this practice, Numerian scribes would compose messages like:  \nadd(A, B)  \nand expect the Sage\u2019s answer\u2014a single number revealing the total amount.\n\nFor example, if a traveler presented heaps sized two and three, and implored, \"add(2, 3),\" the Sage would quickly respond, \"5\"\u2014for this was the sum of the treasures. On another day, should a farmer ask with five and seven apples, \"add(5, 7),\" Sage Sumwell would utter, \"12,\" ensuring trade and festivity could both proceed unimpeded.\n\nSo it was that Numeria\u2019s peace and prosperity rested partly on this ritual of uniting sets with unwavering precision. All who sought the Sage\u2019s wisdom needed merely to state two numbers, trusting that the ancient law would gift them the complete tally. Thus, the process was immortalized in the annals: given any two numbers, provide their sum\u2014no matter the treasures the people bore. And so, Numerian records would show:\n\nadd(2, 3)  \n5\n\nadd(5, 7)  \n12\n\n\u2014clear as the morning sun, and as just as the kingdom\u2019s arithmetic.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient kingdom of Lexica, a remarkable contest took place every year in the city\u2019s grand amphitheater. Here, wise storytellers and eccentric collectors would gather, each bringing with them two arcane scrolls, each inscribed with a chain of cryptic runes\u2014unique letters from the all-powerful alphabet. The magic of Lexica granted special importance not to the quantity of each rune, but to the distinctiveness of the runes themselves; what mattered most was which magical runes were present, not how often they appeared.\n\nAccording to the city\u2019s revered tradition, a challenge would arise: \u201cGiven any two scrolls, can you, O seeker, determine whether both scrolls speak of the *exact same magical runes*\u2014no rune missing, and no extra rune added?\u201d This curious test, known as the \u201cBrotherhood of Runes,\u201d was governed by one simple decree: two scrolls were considered rune-brothers if and only if, upon examining them, the set of unique runes visible on both was exactly the same; the number of times a rune appeared in either scroll was utterly irrelevant. Only the roster of runes counted.\n\nThe flocking participants were then instructed on the rules. Each time a pair of scrolls was presented, each scroll was to be considered as an uninterrupted word, neither empty nor containing spaces. The keepers of the contest would accept these words, in twofold\u2014one scroll after the other, both attuned to the tongue of Lexica, which allowed the full range of lowercase Latin letters, and each scroll obedient in length, not exceeding the mystical upper limit inscribed by the court\u2019s wizards (but the tale did not reveal the exact bound; only that it was practical for mortals to handle).\n\nFor each pair, a fateful judgment awaited, to be bestowed in the ancient binary script of the kingdom\u2014*True* if the scrolls mirrored each other in their rune collection, *False* if any rune was absent in one but present in another, or if a new rune intruded from the shadows. The artisans of Lexica beseeched you: for every such scroll pair, you must answer faithfully, using the oracular language of the realm. The input, the adjudicators proclaimed, would always arrive as two words offered to your function (*s0*, *s1*), each a string representing the sequence of runes on each scroll; your response must be either *True* (if the scrolls share exactly the same runes) or *False* (if they do not).\n\nTo guide the hopeful, the archivist of Lexica laid out several ancient examples upon golden tablets:  \n- When presented with the scrolls \u201ceabcdzzzz\u201d and \u201cdddzzzzzzzddeddabc\u201d, the verdict is *True*, for despite the chaos of duplication, the runes themselves are matched perfectly.  \n- Upon the examination of \u201cabcd\u201d and \u201cdddddddabc\u201d, the ruling is again *True*\u2014the profusion of a single rune does not sway the sentinel.  \n- Should the scrolls be \u201ceabcd\u201d and \u201cdddddddabc\u201d, the answer is a firm *False*, for one scroll utters a rune uncaught by its partner.  \n- When the runes are \u201cabcd\u201d versus \u201cdddddddabce\u201d, this, too, yields *False*\u2014an extra rune condemns the pair.  \n- Finally, when \u201ceabcdzzzz\u201d and \u201cdddzzzzzzzddddabc\u201d are put forth, the outcome is *False*; a missing rune divides their fates.\n\nThus, through the festival of runes, the denizens of Lexica learned not to count the chants and repetitions of their ancient symbols, but only to mind the roster of their arcane collection. And so, for every scroll pair you encounter, answer wisely: do they belong to the Brotherhood of Runes, or are they wanderers on separate magical paths?",

        "question_content": "In the ancient land of Numeria, scholars were entranced by the mysteries of magical growth. Among their most revered legacies was the Legend of the Golden Sequence, believed to capture the spirits of harmony and progress. This sequence began when the wise sage, Fibo the Dreamer, conjured two orbs of light; the first gleamed with the power of solitude, radiating a single spark, and the second echoed this brilliance with a spark of its own. These first two beacons, born one after another, laid the foundation for all that followed.\n\nAccording to Numerian lore, each new orb was not shaped from raw essence alone. Instead, each took on its glow by drawing powers from the two previous orbs\u2014the one that came right before and the one before that\u2014combining their light, and becoming the next in the line. The very first orb shone with a solitary spark, the second matched its elder\u2019s glow, and every subsequent orb joined forces with its two immediate ancestors to blaze even brighter.\n\nThe Council of Archives decreed a special inquiry. They posed a challenge to the adventurers and scholars: Given a council decree specifying a single position within the Golden Sequence\u2014the position referred to simply as the decree\u2019s number\u2014could a worthy seeker determine the precise brilliance of the orb at that place? In doing so, the seeker must understand the pattern by which the sequence grows and deliver the light\u2019s intensity corresponding to the request.\n\nTo formalize their archival logs, the Council stated that each inquiry would provide a single decree to the chronicler; the decree would bear exactly one number, representing which orb's glow was sought. In response, the chronicler would consult the ancient scrolls and return the intensity of that orb\u2019s light. For instance, should the council ask about the tenth orb, the chronicler would respond with fifty-five sparks; if they inquired about the first orb, it would simply be one, and the eighth would be twenty-one.\n\nThe procedure was to be carried out as follows: The chronicler would receive a scroll inscribed with a single number, written as in ancient Numerian numerals. The chronicler\u2019s answer, reflecting the glow of the specified orb, would always be a lone number inscribed in reply. For example, if the council presented the scroll inscribed with \"10\", the chronicler must respond with \"55\"; an inquiry of \"1\" would yield \"1\", while \"8\" would be answered with \"21\".\n\nThus, it remains the tradition of Numeria that each seeker who unlocks the mystery of the Golden Sequence must not only honor the ancient pattern\u2014where each new light is the union of the two before\u2014but also provide the answer in the manner fitting the Council\u2019s scrolls: one number in, one radiant answer out. The council\u2019s records, filled with such pairings, forever tell the tale of the land illuminated by the magic of Fibonacci.",

The final value of b is the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nThe time complexity of this program is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables a and b.\n",

        "question_content": "In the fantastical city of Glyphoria, ancient scribes communicate using a unique language known as Bracketa. In this tongue, every message is written as a string of symbols, each either a left-pointing glyph, etched as \"<\", or a right-pointing glyph, depicted as \">\". These symbols, the legend says, are magical gatekeepers\u2014one must always be matched perfectly with its complement to harmonize the message. The balance of these glyphs is taken so seriously that any imbalance is rumored to unleash misfortune upon the scribe.\n\nTo preserve order, the scribes abide by a strict tradition: for every left-pointing glyph inscribed, there must eventually be a right-pointing glyph that seals it. However, if a message ever contains more right-pointing glyphs than left at any point while reading from start to finish, the parchment is immediately deemed cursed and unreadable. Likewise, when the final symbol is penned, the tally of paired glyphs must be exact; otherwise, the message is thought to summon chaos.\n\nThe scribes' challenge is to test whether a given Bracketa scroll maintains perfect glyphic harmony. Upon reading a scroll\u2014interpreted as a string provided by a young apprentice\u2014the elders must pronounce whether the scroll is balanced in accordance with all traditions: never at any stage should there be more right-pointing glyphs than left, and by the end, every glyph's partner must be found. Their verdict must be concise: if every left-pointing glyph is matched precisely by a right-pointing glyph, the message is blessed and true; if not, it is false and unworthy.\n\nScribes receive their scrolls in a standard ritual: a messenger presents the scroll's inscription as a single string of \"<\" and \">\" characters (this is the story\u2019s input). The council must respond with a clear judgment: if harmony prevails, return True; if discord is found, return False (these are the outputs required). For clarity and posterity, the council\u2019s edict is always pronounced in this true-or-false manner for each scroll received.\n\nConsider how the elders judged the following historical scrolls:\n- When presented with the scroll \"<\", the council found disharmony, for no matching right-pointing glyph appeared, and so answered False.\n- A scroll inscribed as \"<>\" was perfectly balanced; the elders answered True.\n- Another scribe presented \"<<><>>\", in which every left-pointing glyph was sealed appropriately, so this too was judged True.\n- Yet a message of \"><<>\" was pronounced false, as a right-pointing glyph appeared too soon, breaking the rules of pairing.\n\nThus, any who aspire to become a master scribe must learn to implement this sacred validation: receive the Bracketa string, and return True if and only if glyphic harmony is preserved from beginning to end; otherwise, return False.",

        "question_content": "In the storied realm of Numeria, there lay a long, winding Path called the Sequence Road. Along this road, townsfolk placed a series of numbered stones\u2014each marked with a unique value, sometimes small, sometimes great; these numbers followed the will of the Pathkeeper, who orchestrated their order. The dwellers of Numeria had a curious obsession: they admired roads where the stones\u2019 numbers formed either a steady climb toward the mountaintop, with each new stone standing taller than (or at least as tall as) the one behind it, or a steady descent into the valley, where every stone nestled itself lower (or no higher) than its predecessor.\n\nBut the council of Numeria had strict stipulations regarding Sequence Road. If ever, while journeying from the start to the end of the path, the traveler found the numbers rising and then falling, or falling then rising\u2014breaking the steady incline or decline\u2014the Path would lose its honorific of \u201cMonotonic.\u201d Thus, a Monotonic Path was one whose sequence of stones never switched from ascending to descending or vice versa; it must be entirely non-decreasing or non-increasing, but never both.\n\nThe wise Pathkeeper thus challenged travelers to test the Path: when presented with any arrangement of stone values, could they discern whether the path was Monotonic, in either a climb or descent? For every such sequence, the Pathkeeper would demand a clear verdict\u2014either affirming with a proud \u201cTrue\u201d if the path kept its monotonic stride, or a somber \u201cFalse\u201d if ever its order wavered between climbing and falling. Efficiency was prized: the council required the traveler make their judgment by examining the stones only in a single trek from start to finish, not turning back, regardless of the Path\u2019s length.\n\nIn presenting such a sequence, each traveler would do so as a line of stone numbers, placed within a ledger entry. These entries would take the form of a list\u2014for example, a path paved by stones numbered one, two, four, and twenty; or another, bearing the values one, twenty, four, and ten. Upon examining each sequence, the traveler must write the result: a single word\u2014either \u201cTrue\u201d or \u201cFalse\u201d\u2014beneath the entry.\n\nSo it was written in the council\u2019s ancient scrolls of instruction:\nWhen the wise Pathkeeper inspects a stretch such as `[1, 2, 4, 20]`, she must return \u201cTrue\u201d, as the stones never falter in their upward stride. For `[1, 20, 4, 10]`, the path stumbles from ascent to descent, and thus she inscribes \u201cFalse\u201d. For `[4, 1, 0, -10]`, the stoic decline qualifies as Monotonic, and again, the answer shall be \u201cTrue\u201d.\n\nAnd thus, the tales of Numeria\u2019s Sequence Road remind every traveler: examine the Path\u2019s order, decide its Monotonic honor, and let your answer reflect the path\u2019s unwavering nature.",

It keeps track of whether the sequence is increasing or decreasing by setting the `increasing` variable to `True` if the next number is greater than the current one, `False` if it's less, and `None` if they're equal. If the sequence ever changes direction (from increasing to decreasing or vice versa), the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any direction changes, the function returns `True`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because it needs to check each number in the list. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of extra space to store the `increasing` variable and the loop variables.\n"

        "question_content": "Once, in the bustling market town of Twinvale, two rival merchants\u2019 guilds thrived. Each guild maintained an ever-changing inventory of treasures and trinkets, collected from far-off lands and secretive peddlers. Guild Elders kept tallies of these possessions as chronicle-lists: the Copper List of the east and the Silver List of the west. Adventurers and townsfolk, always searching for rare bargains, often wondered\u2014were there cherished artifacts available from *both* guilds, and if so, which were truly unique and shared?\n\nThe guild ledgers, inscribed with the numbers marking artifact identities, held the key. But the custom of Twinvale strictly forbade mentioning artifact numbers using variable emblems or cryptic arithmetic\u2014only natural speech would do. Furthermore, the marketplace council insisted that for every query comparing two inventories, the answer must give up a scroll: a neatly ordered row of artifact numbers, in ascending order, each number only once, and only if it could be found in both guilds\u2019 lists.\n\nThe rules further dictated that the method, known locally as the \"common artifacts scribe,\" must receive, as its input, a pair of ledgers\u2014each delivered as a parchment list of treasures (that is, two lists in sequence, one for each guild). The scribe\u2019s output must then be a collection: a new list inscribed with every artifact found in both inventories, sorted smallest to largest, with duplicates vanished like a magician\u2019s illusion. If no artifact was found in both lists, then the parchment must simply remain blank.\n\nTo accomplish this task, the scribe compared the Twinvale ledgers, searching every entry for matches. Whenever a number appeared in both ledgers, it was illuminated in the scribe\u2019s mind, and he made sure each such number appeared just once in the answer, no matter how many times it appeared in the ledgers themselves. When the scribe recorded the answer, he always put the smallest number first and the largest last, with none missing in between.\n\nTo clarify the system, consider these cases the council posed to the scribe. First, if the east guild\u2019s ledger listed the numbers one, four, three, thirty-four, six hundred fifty-three, two, and five, while the western guild listed five, seven, one, five again, nine, six hundred fifty-three, and one hundred twenty-one\u2014the scribe would respond with: one, five, six hundred fifty-three. That is, these three artifacts alone can be found in both guilds\u2019 shops, and he lists them in increasing order, never repeating any artifact.  \nSecond, if the first guild\u2019s artifacts were five, three, two, and eight, while the second held simply three and two, the scribe\u2019s reply would be the pair: two, three\u2014reflecting all commonly available artifacts, again uniquely and in order.\n\nThus, by following this careful system, the marketplace elders of Twinvale ensured that every merchant, traveler, and townsfolk could swiftly learn which treasures might be found in both corners of the square, listed for all to see\u2014an enduring testament to the clarity and cooperation at the heart of Twinvale\u2019s bustling life.",

The method takes two lists `l1` and `l2` as input. The method first sorts both lists. Then, it initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to 0. The method then enters a loop that continues until one of the pointers reaches the end of its respective list.\n\nInside the loop, the method checks if the elements at the current pointers are equal. If they are, the element is added to the `common_elements` list and both pointers are moved. If the element at the `i`-th position in `l1` is smaller, the `i` pointer is moved. If the element at the `j`-th position in `l2` is smaller, the `j` pointer is moved.\n\nAfter the loop, the method removes duplicates from the `common_elements` list and returns it.\n",

        "question_content": "In the ancient kingdom of Arithmos, there stood a colossal tower built from mystic stones. The wizard-council often set intellectual quests for brave minds, and this year they devised a most peculiar challenge. The Great Sage declared: \u201cFor a sacred integer artifact, whose value is always greater than one and never possesses the indivisible purity of a prime, we seek the mightiest prime number carved into its very foundation\u2014the largest fragment from which its essence can still be wholly formed through multiplication.\u201d\n\nIn Arithmos, a \u201cprime shard\u201d was considered a rare gemstone that could not be split organically into smaller, equally grand stones except by unity and itself. The artifact, in question, was always constructed from at least two of these gemstones, making it composite by nature. The elders decreed that beneath the artifact\u2019s surface, countless prime shards supported its structure, each acting as a silent pillar. Of these, the council\u2019s lore demanded: which is the grandest shard that could be found, such that no greater prime would ever be the root of this artifact\u2019s craft?\n\nApplicants would be provided with the strength of the artifact as an integer, delivered through a magical scroll\u2014think of the scroll\u2019s sequence as a single line with the artifact\u2019s value. The wizard\u2019s apprentice would then inscribe the answer in a new scroll: a single line, stating which prime shard was the largest to support the artifact. This was the only expected communication\u2014the input and output each fitting upon their own solitary line.\n\nThe challenge lay not merely in finding a suitable shard, but in finding the largest possible prime gemstone, efficiently and without overlooking any hidden beneath layers of simpler stones. The wizard-council repeated: \u201cGiven any artifact with the stipulated qualities, your purpose is not just to find any prime within its make, but to reveal the greatest such, for that is the true heart of the artifact\u2019s might.\u201d\n\nTo clarify, the elders recited a pair of stories from the chronicles: In one tale, the artifact bore the value thirteen thousand, one hundred ninety-five. The largest prime shard supporting it was discovered to be twenty-nine, an unrivaled relic among those assembled. In another account, the artifact had the simplistic firmness of two thousand and forty-eight\u2014wholly built from the gems of the number two, thus making two both the smallest and the largest prime in its bedrock. Written upon scrolls:\n\n13195  \n\u2192 29\n\n2048  \n\u2192 2\n\nSo, the legend continues: Seek not the easiest, nor the first, but the grandest prime shard hidden within\u2014the one that holds the true power of the Arithmos artifact.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient city of Parenthia, communication was an art form intertwined with ritual and tradition. The citizens of Parenthia did not speak with words alone; instead, they arranged specially crafted silver and gold bands\u2014delicate circles that could be interlocked or contained within one another\u2014to convey meaning. The complexity of a message, and its subtlety, was measured by how deeply these bands nested within each other. The more layers contained within, the deeper the sentiment or secret being shared.\n\nEach day, the Master Interpreter of Parenthia would be brought a parchment upon which several of these band-assemblies were sketched side by side, separated by modest gaps. The artisans would present sequences of bands, sometimes with only a single layer, other times with many layers intricately woven together. The Interpreter\u2019s task was to discern, for every assembly depicted, the number of layers buried at the deepest point\u2014a measure treasured in Parenthian society, for it symbolized both wisdom and trust.\n\nThe ritual dictated the following rules: Each assembly was drawn as a sequence of open and close symbols\u2014very much like the delicate arms of the bands themselves\u2014arranged without error. The Interpreter could expect that every assembly was well-formed: whenever a golden band opened, it always found its matching closure in perfect order, never crossing paths with another\u2019s conclusion. The parchment would bear several such sequences, each separated by a single space, and the Interpreter\u2019s wisdom was called upon to examine each one individually.\n\nThus, the Master Interpreter\u2019s task was as follows: For every band-assembly depicted upon the parchment, the Interpreter must determine how many layers at most were nestled within one another at any point in that assembly. The Interpreter would then present the answer as a list, each number representing the deepest secret layer from the corresponding assembly, in the very order they appeared on the parchment. The purity of their answer was measured by how swiftly and accurately they could discern these depths, for the city prized clarity as much as intricacy.\n\nWhen presenting a new parchment, the artisans would begin by inscribing a single line, each band-assembly rendered as a sequence of open and closed arcs (represented by the simple characters \u2018(\u2019 and \u2018)\u2019), with a single space marking the divide between distinct assemblies. The Interpreter would then respond with a string of numbers, each denoting the maximum depth of secret layers for its respective assembly, separated only by spaces\u2014no more, no less.\n\nLet us consider a parchment inscribed with the following:  \n**Input parchment:** `(()()) ((())) () ((())()())`  \nThe Master Interpreter would examine each assembly in turn. The first, with its paired bands and a single layer nestled within another, would yield a depth of two. The second, with three concentric bands, would reveal a depth of three. The third, being the simplest, would show just one layer. The fourth, with its twisting, tangled, yet perfectly formed construction, would reach once more a depth of three. Thus, the Interpreter would present:  \n**Output for the council:** `2 3 1 3`  \nAnd so would the meaning of each secret, and the skill of Parenthia\u2019s Interpreter, be revealed.",

        "question_content": "In the enchanted Kingdom of Numeria, long ago, the Royal Archivists recorded numbers as living spirits, each longing to join together in harmonious procession. These spirits lined up in ascending order, beginning with the humblest\u2014One\u2014and reaching to any grand number that the Sovereign of Numeria would decree for a ritual. The Sovereign was fascinated by the power harnessed when these spirits joined hands, for their combined energy would fuel great spells, heal lands, or inspire revelries.\n\nTradition dictated a strict ritual: whenever a number was declared, every spirit from One up to that very number must join in the ceremony, each contributing their unique energy\u2014never skipping or omitting, for the magic required completeness and unity. The Archivists could only summon as many spirits as ordered by the Sovereign at one time; if the decree was for Thirty, only the first thirty spirits could attend, no more, no less.\n\nThe task for Numeria\u2019s chief mage was clear and pressing. For any number pronounced by the Sovereign during the annual festival, the mage must swiftly and accurately record the total combined energy emitted by all spirits from One up through the chosen number, as if accumulating stones into a single, ever-growing tower. This feat was to be performed as efficiently as possible, so that the Sovereign would not be kept waiting, no matter the size of the decree.\n\nTo formalize the process, the mages would receive a single, positive whole number\u2014the Sovereign\u2019s decree\u2014written on a parchment. Their solemn duty: respond with a matching single number, the sum of all energies from One up to the declared value. For instance, if the decree was inscribed as \"thirty,\" their reply would be \"four hundred sixty-five.\" When instructed with \"one hundred,\" they would respond in kind with \"five thousand fifty\"\u2014a testament to the grandeur of their magic. If the decree read \"five,\" the answer would be a modest \"fifteen,\" while \"ten\" would yield \"fifty-five.\" Naturally, when the Sovereign felt humble and decreed only \"one,\" the answer reflected simply as \"one.\"\n\nTo anchor this ceremony in Numerian tradition, each declaration and answer was formally paired in records, such as:  \n**Decree:** 30 \u2192 **Combined Energy:** 465  \n**Decree:** 100 \u2192 **Combined Energy:** 5050  \n**Decree:** 5 \u2192 **Combined Energy:** 15  \n**Decree:** 10 \u2192 **Combined Energy:** 55  \n**Decree:** 1 \u2192 **Combined Energy:** 1  \n\nThus, the mage\u2019s enduring challenge was to answer each call with a single, precise sum, reflecting exactly the unity of spirits from the modest One to the Sovereign\u2019s chosen peak\u2014and always, to do so with unfaltering grace and swift Numerian logic.",

        "question_content": "In the mystic realm of Parenvale, ancient scrolls governed the fates of its denizens. Each scroll was composed entirely of two precious symbols\u2014the Crescent Rune, shaped like an open arc, and the Full Moon Seal, a closed curve. According to the oldest laws of Parenvale, every Crescent Rune inscribed upon a scroll yearned for a partner to complete it: a Full Moon Seal farther down the parchment. When scroll-keepers prepared a message to the Oracle, they knew that only the most harmoniously balanced scrolls would earn the Oracle\u2019s attention.\n\nThe Parenvale Council set forth a sacred decree for scroll logic: Whenever someone penned a Crescent Rune, it could only be considered proper if, at some point later in the scroll, a Full Moon Seal was waiting to embrace it. At no point\u2014neither at the beginning nor the midst of drafting the scroll\u2014was it permitted for Full Moon Seals to outnumber the Crescents that had come before. If ever a message bore more Seals than Crescents at any spot, it was said to be \u201cunfortunate,\u201d and the Oracle would cast it aside, unread. But if, by the very end of reading, every Crescent was matched by the perfect number of Full Moons\u2014no more, no less\u2014the scroll was deemed \u201cfortunate,\u201d a beacon of harmony to the cosmos.\n\nAs the Oracle\u2019s trusted apprentice, your task is clear: For every mysterious scroll delivered to your study (represented as a string comprised only of the two sacred symbols, with the Crescent Rune appearing as an opening curve and the Full Moon Seal as a closure), you must swiftly determine whether it is \u201cfortunate\u201d or \u201cunfortunate.\u201d The Oracle requires your verdict in an unwavering format: You will receive a message\u2014a string of these symbols\u2014and you must return only whether the scroll is to be celebrated (true) or discarded (false). You may be called upon to judge multiple scrolls in this fashion.\n\nHere are a few instructive echoes from your predecessor\u2019s archives to guide you:\n- If the scroll consisted solely of a single Crescent Rune, with no matching Full Moon Seal to accompany it by journey\u2019s end, you would declare it \u201cunfortunate.\u201d\n- If the scroll displayed a perfectly partnered pair\u2014one Crescent followed by one Full Moon\u2014this symmetry would warm the Oracle\u2019s heart, and you would pronounce it \u201cfortunate.\u201d\n- When confronted with a scroll inscribed with three Crescents gracefully intertwined with an equal number of Full Moons, every pair lovingly matched, then too you would honor it as \u201cfortunate.\u201d\n- However, should a scroll begin abruptly with a Full Moon Seal before any Crescent was inked, or if, at any turn in the scroll, the Seals ever exceeded the Crescents yet unmatched, the balance would be lost, and you would find it \u201cunfortunate.\u201d\n\nThus, the wisdom of Parenvale\u2019s scrolls can be summoned by following the ritual: For each newly presented scroll\u2014passed into your care as a string\u2014you must return the simple truth of its fate: \u201ctrue\u201d if harmonious, \u201cfalse\u201d if not. For instance, the scroll marked only with an opening curve is \u201cfalse\u201d; the pair \u201c()\u201d is \u201ctrue\u201d; the elegant braid \u201c(()())\u201d remains \u201ctrue\u201d; but the stray sequence \u201c)(()\u201d is forever \u201cfalse,\u201d rejected by Parenvale\u2019s time-honored tradition.",

When an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the top element of the stack is popped and compared to ensure they match.

        "question_content": "In the ancient floating city of Calculoria, sages shaped the fates of its skies not with spells, but with the mysterious artistry of *Polynomia*\u2014structures composed of gleaming spheres, each orbiting a central tower at a distinct level. Each sphere at a particular height radiated an energy determined by its \u201cpower level,\u201d and these energies shaped the very winds and weather of Calculoria. The legend told of a ritual, the Rite of Change, by which these energies could be transformed: those seeking to alter the flow of time and air needed only modify the structure according to the sacred \u201cLaw of Derivare.\u201d\n\nThe Rite\u2019s guidelines were elegant, but strict. For every *Polynomia* structure, a sequence was written, beginning with a subtle sphere at the base (the \u201cconstant\u201d), followed by others at successively greater heights, each with its own energy. The energies were listed as numbers in order from lowest to highest sphere. To enact the Rite, the sage would consider each sphere (ignoring the one at the very bottom) and, for each, multiply its energy by the number of steps it stood from the ground; this new value would be given to a newborn sphere one step below, reshaping the energies powering Calculoria. This method distilled the essential vigor and direction of the original arcane wind.\n\nSages received scrolls from across the city, each listing the energies of a *Polynomia* by a series: the first number for the base, the next for the first level, then the second, and so on. Their great challenge: to perform the Rite of Change for every scroll, producing a new sequence with each entry\u2014a purified energy list according to the Law of Derivare. If a scroll contained only one energy (a structure with only a base sphere), the renewal would result in nothingness, for there was no higher vigor to draw upon.\n\nThe sages\u2019 task was clear: upon receiving a parchment inscribed with a list of numbers, they would return a new list in the same style, representing the transformed energies of the renewed *Polynomia*. The process must be completed efficiently and perfectly, no matter how long the original list\u2014be it as short as a single note or as lengthy as ten thousand. Each energy entry (excluding the base) would, in turn, take its original energy, multiply it by its own height above the base (that is, its position in the sequence), and inscribe this value into the new scroll.\n\nLet us peer into the ledger of Calculoria. Suppose one parchment arrived bearing the marks `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`. The sages would, following their rules, conjure the transformed energies by multiplying the second figure by one, the third by two, the fourth by three, and so on, resulting in `[1, 4, 12, 20]`\u2014the renewed energy ladder bestowed upon the city\u2019s winds. For a simpler scroll, perhaps inscribed `[1, 2, 3]`, the answer would be `[2, 6]`, since the first height above the ground gives `2*1=2`, the second gives `3*2=6`.\n\nThus, with every parchment the sages received\u2014a list of energies\u2014they would return a transformed list, illustrating the essence of the Rite of Change. Even as the city soared ever higher, the tradition endured: every new scroll was answered with a calculation, each ancient law preserved in perfect logic and balance.",

The method takes a list of integers `xs` as input. If the list has 1 or fewer elements, the method returns an empty list.

For each element `x` at index `i` (where `i` is 1-indexed), it multiplies `x` by `i` (which is the number of steps it stands from the ground), and appends the result to `result`.\n\nFinally, the method returns `result`, which is the transformed list of energies.\n",

The expression `xs[i] * (i + 1)` multiplies the `i`th element of `xs` by `i + 1`. The `for i in range(1, len(xs))` part of the list comprehension ensures that the function only multiplies the elements of `xs` from the second element onwards.

        "question_content": "In the distant realm of Arithmetia, there existed a legendary order of sages known as the Fibfibians. Their wisdom ran deep, entwined with the mysterious rhythm of a sequence that both defined their world and shaped their destinies. This ancient order revered the progression of mystical stones, each representing a number in their sacred FibFib sequence. These stones were not given randomly, but according to an ironclad tradition that dated back to when time itself was young.\n\nThe tradition began with the Council of Three Elders declaring: \u201cOn the eve the first stone is cast, its value shall be nothing. The second is also naught, for foundations require patience. Only upon the third does a spark ignite\u2014a single light now shines.\u201d Thereafter, for any subsequent turn, the value of the newest stone would be the sum of the values carved into the previous three stones. Thus, each new revelation was built from the echoes of the last three foundings, symbolizing remembrance, continuity, and creativity. The elders decreed that for any positive whole number placed before them, the path to the corresponding stone in the sequence must follow these rituals, with the three initial values in eternal succession: zero, zero, followed by one.\n\nWhen an apprentice was tasked with retrieving the wisdom of the nth Fibfib stone, he would begin with none, no value, and then advance to the second, again nothing, and then the third, which held worth of just one. For any subsequent stone, he would gather the wisdom inscribed on the three stones before it\u2014adding each together for the current stone\u2019s value. The goal of each apprentice was to learn how to find the exact value of any stone placed in the nth position, following these rules as efficiently as possible, no matter how grand the number given to him by the elders might be.\n\nTo test their skills, the Grand Archive required the apprentices to develop a ritual\u2014an efficient method or \u201cfunction\u201d\u2014that, given an integer inscribed on a scroll, would reveal the value of the stone at that position in the sequence. The input was always a single whole number indicating the desired position. The answer required was, naturally, a single number: the value of the FibFib stone resting at that spot in tradition.\n\nIn the halls of education, scribes recorded past inquiries and their solutions for future wisdom seekers. For instance, when an apprentice asked for the first stone, the response was zero. Seeking the fifth, the archives declared the value to be four. When a seeker inquired about the eighth\u2014surely a grander stone\u2014the answer was twenty-four. These examples were always provided this way: the apprentice would state the inquiry with the number, and the response would come as the value of the stone.\n\nThus, the mind and magic of Arithmetia flourished, bound by the tradition of the FibFib sequence. To be recognized as a true apprentice, one must recite the ritual and correctly reveal the values for any asked-for stone. For instance, upon stating \u201c1,\u201d the archive would respond \u201c0\u201d; for \u201c5,\u201d they would reply \u201c4\u201d; and for \u201c8,\u201d the respected answer would be \u201c24,\u201d these being the trusted echoes and testaments of the FibFibian way.",

        "question_content": "In the luminous city of Lexiton, every word spoken, sung, or written radiates a unique magical glow fueled by the power of vowels. The city\u2019s citizens revere these six mystical runes: \u2018a\u2019, \u2018e\u2019, \u2018i\u2019, \u2018o\u2019, \u2018u\u2019, and, curiously, \u2018y\u2019\u2014though the last only unleashes its magic when it rests at the tail end of a word. The city\u2019s scholars, known as Lexiticians, have long cataloged and analyzed the glow of each word to understand the true energy it pours into their chronicles, songs, and spell incantations.\n\nAmong the lorekeepers, a specialized guild exists whose sole purpose is to measure the essence contained in any given word. According to tradition, this essence is found by counting how many of the sacred vowels appear, with 'y' invoking its special power only if it sits at the very end of its word\u2014which is a rare trait, much discussed in Lexiton\u2019s magical debates. This ritual must heed no regard to whether a rune appears as a tiny glyph or as a grand, capital glyph; all are equally potent. The magic must be tallied solely based on their presence, regardless of size or form.\n\nLexiton\u2019s Grand Archive has commissioned a chronomancer to devise an ancient function\u2014known in common tongue as **vowels_count**\u2014which receives a single word as its script. The task is to return, for that keyword, the total measure of rune-essence hiding within: that is, the count of \u2018a\u2019, \u2018e\u2019, \u2018i\u2019, \u2018o\u2019, \u2018u\u2019, and \u2018y\u2019 (the last only if perched at the final letter). Written as follows, the function receives a word (a string), and returns an integer reflecting its hidden vowel potency.\n\nTo guide apprentices of magic in their work, clear examples have been preserved in the Guildbook. Should one offer the word \"abcde\" to the ritual, the result would be two, for only \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018e\u2019 shine. If a supplicant places \"ACEDY\" before the oracle, three lights appear: \u2018A\u2019, \u2018E\u2019, and \u2018Y\u2019 are all empowered\u2014the last by virtue of its majestic position at the end. As such, the invocation, typed at the scriptorium, follows this format:\n\n> vowels_count(\"abcde\") returns 2  \n> vowels_count(\"ACEDY\") returns 3\n\nFor aspiring lexiticians, the process is thus: input any word of interest into the spell-circle (that is, call the function with a string argument), and swiftly receive the tally of glowing rune-essence, mindful of the special role played by the trailing \u2018y\u2019. The clarity of the city\u2019s wisdom ensures all understand: only a single word is ever considered at a time, and the grand tally disregards glyph size, counting every eligible rune provided by the rule.\n\nThus, through enchanted computation, the children and sages of Lexiton fulfill the age-old charge: to measure, as efficiently and completely as possible, the true vowel-glow of every word that crosses their scroll. The examples above, echoing in marble halls, forever exemplify this art\u2014reminding each new generation how the light of a word is revealed by counting its magical runes according to these sacred rules.",

        "question_content": "In the secluded city of Numeralis, far away from lands of letters and words, the citizens concerned themselves only with the arrangement of digits. Here, the digiteers\u2014wise keepers of numerical order\u2014were often faced with strange puzzles, handed down by the ancient Council of Shifts. Their most cryptic challenge involved the practice known as \"Spiraling,\" a kind of intricate dance in which the positions of a number's figures were reconfigured in circular ways, always to unlock new secrets or transmit vital messages.\n\nWithin Numeralis, the ritual of Spiraling followed peculiar and unwavering customs. When instructed, a digiteer would take a sacred number\u2014crafted from a series of digits, never marred by symbols or embellishments\u2014and consult the Scroll of Shifts, where a shift amount, decreed as a whole number, would be etched beside the number. The digiteer\u2019s task: move each digit from its position to the right, by the number of steps matching the decree, wrapping around the edges of the number much like dancers cycling through a line. However, should the decree demand more steps than there were digits in the number, an ancient coda would be invoked: instead of cycling, the line of digits would be reversed, turning the number on its head.\n\nThe digiteers, ever precise, worked such transformations with discipline. They would receive clear instructions: given a number and the count for the shifting ritual, how should the digits be rearranged? If the decree was lesser than the number\u2019s length, the digits would spiral right, with the rightmost ones wrapping to the start. If the count matched the number\u2019s length, the formation remained unchanged\u2014a perfect cycle, restoring order. Only when the decree exceeded the number\u2019s size did the inversion magic come into play, flipping the entire string of digits in dramatic fashion.\n\nTheir chronicles demanded strict documentation, so each transformation was recorded in a specific form. The instructions would always come as two items: a single integer, representing the chosen number for the ceremony, and a second integer, stating the rightward shift to be performed. The outcome, carefully transcribed, took the form of a string, composed of the newly arranged digits. This clarity ensured the preservation of the rituals across generations.\n\nTo better understand and teach these customs, the digiteers kept exemplary records. For instance, if tasked with Spiraling the digits \"one and two\" (forming the number twelve) with a decree of one, they would report \"twenty-one,\" for the final formation would see the second digit wrapped to the front. If the decree matched the length\u2014two in this case\u2014the number would remain untouched, yielding \"twelve.\" And should the decree overshoot the dignity of the original formation, the revered reversal would be performed, spinning \"twelve\" into \"twenty-one\" once again.\n\nThrough the meticulous application of these Spiraling rites and the scrupulous documentation of all inputs, outputs, and their logic, Numeralis maintained its legacy of numerical wonders. The digiteers' steadfast attention to the cycles and inversions not only preserved harmony in their records, but also equipped every citizen with the understanding needed to interpret and perform the fabled Circular Shifts.",

This method takes two arguments: `x`, the number to be shifted, and `shift`, the number of positions to shift. The method converts the number to a string, and if the shift is greater than or equal to the length of the number, it calculates the remainder of the shift divided by the length of the number to ensure the shift is performed in a circular manner. It then performs the circular shift by slicing the string at the shift position and concatenating the two parts in reversed order. Finally, it returns the shifted number as a string.\n",

The shift is performed by taking a slice of the string from the end of the string to the position of the shift, and then appending a slice from the start of the string to the position of the shift. The result is then converted back to an integer and returned.\n",

It then calculates the length of the number. If the shift is greater than the number's length, it calculates the remainder of the shift divided by the number's length to find the actual shift. If the shift is equal to the number's length, it returns the original number. Otherwise, it performs the circular shift by slicing the string at the shift index and concatenating the two parts in reversed order. Finally, it converts the shifted string back to an integer and returns it.\n"

        "question_content": "In the distant city of Luminia, every citizen is born carrying an invisible mark\u2014some glow with the radiant brilliance of celestial flames, while others remain cloaked in shadows, walking quietly among their peers. The city\u2019s Grand Archivists, ever-curious seekers of cosmic patterns, believe that the brightest among them, called the Upperfolk, hold secrets encoded within their very being. To unlock these mysteries, they devised a peculiar test known as the \"Sum of Radiance.\" \n\nThe laws of Luminia are clear and precise. Each resident\u2019s true nature is revealed in the Grand Registry, where a name is written for every soul. Only the Upperfolk\u2014those who bear names spelled using capital script\u2014contribute to the city\u2019s collective luminescence. These elite few each radiate a unique energy, determined by the code inscribed upon their initial in the ancient Celestial Codex. Those who walk among the Lowerfolk (whose names are written in small script) cannot offer their light; their presence remains uncounted in the Grand Archivists\u2019 ritual.\n\nFor the Archivists\u2019 purpose, a registry is presented\u2014a scroll bearing a string of letters, both capital and small. The archivist\u2019s task is to gaze upon the scroll and, referring to the Celestial Codex, tally the total radiance of only those Upperfolk whose names appear in capital script. Each capital letter is translated to its corresponding number from the Codex, and all such numbers are meticulously added together. If the registry offers no names in capital script, then the total radiance is recorded as none at all.\n\nFor clarity, the Grand Archivists have established the following rite for reckoning the Sum of Radiance:\n- They accept a single scroll, which contains a series of letters\u2014capital or small\u2014but nothing more.\n- They must return a single number, which expresses the sum of each capital letter\u2019s Codex value found within that scroll, forsaking all others.\n- The Archivists demonstrate the ritual with several scrolls:  \n    - A scroll with no names (\"\") yields a Sum of Radiance of none, which is the Archivists\u2019 way of inscribing a value of zero.\n    - A scroll marked \"abAB\" reveals two Upperfolk: 'A' and 'B', whose Codex values add to one hundred thirty-one.\n    - If presented \"abcCd\", only the solitary 'C' shines through, its radiance valued at sixty-seven.\n    - In \"helloE\", the glow of 'E' is recorded, contributing sixty-nine.\n    - For the scroll \"woArBld\", the Upperfolk 'A' and 'B' together reach a combined radiance of one hundred thirty-one.\n    - On encountering \"aAaaaXa\", the Archivists find 'A' and 'X', whose energies together total one hundred fifty-three.\n\nThus, the Archivists have encoded their tradition within a chronicle of function: the scroll received is the sole input, and the great Sum of Radiance\u2014the output\u2014must be presented as a single number. And so, through the careful tallying of Upperfolk energy, the secrets of Luminia remain ever-bright for generations that follow.",

        "question_content": "In the heart of the Orchard Kingdom, where fruit trees lined the horizon and sweet fragrances danced on the wind, there existed a curious custom. Baskets of fruit were everywhere, but in each basket, the fruits\u2014apples, oranges, and mangoes\u2014were always kept in secret proportions to maintain the mystery of the harvest. Villagers could only know the sum of apples and oranges in any basket by reading an inscription woven into the basket\u2019s rim, while the total number of fruits within was whispered into the ear of the fruit counter by the Orchard\u2019s steward.\n\nThe ancient Fruit Counters\u2019 Guild decreed a simple rule for discovering the hidden number of mangoes: to uncover the number of golden mangoes nestled among the other fruits, one must subtract the inscription\u2019s apple and orange sum from the total fruits declared. Never did the villagers see any symbol, only words on baskets such as \u201cseven apples and five oranges,\u201d and so their calculations involved no marks but mental subtraction alone.\n\nTherefore, the villagers\u2019 challenge was this: whenever presented with a basket\u2019s inscribed phrase telling the apples and oranges, and whenever told the whole fruit count within, they strove to deduce\u2014efficiently and precisely\u2014the elusive number of mangoes, using only the tools of mental arithmetic and tradition. This task was of utmost importance, for the king\u2019s feasts depended not on apples nor oranges, but on the bounty of mangoes discovered in each basket.\n\nTo help govern the logic of their tradition, the Fruit Counters\u2019 Guild formalized a protocol for all their rituals:  \n\u2013 The merchant supplying the basket would first state a phrase, such as \"X apples and Y oranges,\" where X and Y were always clear whole numbers written in words.  \n\u2013 Then, they would announce the total count of fruits inside the basket, expressed as a single integer.  \n\u2013 The task for the fruit counter was always to declare, in turn, only the singular number representing the count of mangoes, neither more nor less.\n\nLet the following be examples of shipments arriving at the king\u2019s table:  \nIf a merchant announced \u201cfive apples and six oranges\u201d with a total fruit count of nineteen, the counter would respond, \u201ceight mangoes rest within this basket,\u201d having subtracted five and six from nineteen. If another reported \u201czero apples and one orange\" for a basket holding three fruits, the response would be, \u201ctwo mangoes shimmer beneath the leaves.\u201d For the grandest haul\u2014\u201ctwo apples and three oranges,\u201d among one hundred fruits\u2014the fruit counter would declare, \u201cninety-five mangoes, the pride of the Orchard Kingdom, await the feast.\u201d And for the richest harvest: \u201cone hundred apples and one orange,\u201d among one hundred and twenty fruits, the secret revealed is \u201cnineteen mangoes hidden amongst the bounty.\u201d\n\nThus, through phrases for the apples and oranges, one declared basket size, and a swift calculation, the villagers ensured no mango was overlooked. Each Merchant\u2019s phrase and fruit total entered the record as an enchanted pair\u2014first the phrase, then the number\u2014and the fruit counter\u2019s answer, always a singular number, followed as the official proclamation of the day\u2019s mangoes discovered.",

        "question_content": "In the heart of the verdant Sylvan Realm, a mystical grove thrived where the Tree of Numbers grew its branches in curious patterns. Each bough on this enchanted tree sprouted a row of shimmering, jeweled berries, and these berries were prized by all villagers for their magical potential. To the initiated, each cluster told a story\u2014a branch could have anywhere from one to ten thousand berries, each bearing a natural number etched in its gleam. The value of each berry could never dip below zero, for this was the law of the land: no berry decayed, withering only in value so far as zero, but never less.\n\nThe wise druids, lorekeepers of the grove, observed a particular tradition when the time came to harvest. For the mystical rituals performed at the equinox, one berry\u2014the rarest sort\u2014was needed: it must be a berry whose number was even, and among all such berries, the one with the smallest etched number was the most potent for their chants. If by fate several of these berries possessed equal, smallest even numbers, the first to appear along the branch from left to right was deemed the most auspicious. Yet, the grove withheld its magic in absence; if a branch sprouted no berries or no even-numbered berry, the druids would return empty-handed, and the ritual postponed.\n\nThe villagers' task was thus: for a given branch (which they wrote out as a list of berry values, in the order they grew from base to tip), they must tell the druids precisely which berry to pluck. Their report would be a pair of numbers resting in a tiny scroll: first, the value of the prized berry; second, its position along the branch, counting from the base where counting began at one, though the scribes of distant lands (in the tradition of the ancient scrolls) often started from zero in such records. If the villagers returned empty-handed, the scroll would reveal nothing at all\u2014an empty list, a symbol for no plucking possible.\n\nTo communicate with other villages and keep records for the druids, each harvesting attempt would be made by invoking a ritual\u2014\u2018pluck\u2019\u2014which took as its offering a list of the branch\u2019s berry values (all nonnegative, just as lore decreed) and returned the result as a list of exactly two numbers: the chosen even berry\u2019s value and its position (as an index from the beginning), or else an empty list if no suitable berry was to be had. In this way, the druids could quickly know which berry to take from each branch, depending on the values reported.\n\nA brief review of recent harvests illustrates the process:\n- When one branch was presented bearing berries valued as [4,2,3], the report returned was [2, 1], for the berry with value two (the smallest even value), found at the second spot along the branch.\n- For [1,2,3], the ritual focused on the same berry at position one, again yielding [2, 1].\n- For a branch bearing no berries at all\u2014[]\u2014the villagers submitted an empty report, for no harvest could be made.\n- On the day the druids found a branch with [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2], the first berry of zero\u2014at position one\u2014proved the most vital, leading to the report [0, 1].\n\nThe villagers had to keep in mind the natural bounds set by the grove\u2019s magic: every branch would have at least one berry and at most ten thousand, with each berry\u2019s value zero or greater. Thus, the task of finding and reporting\u2014with insight and efficiency\u2014became essential for the ongoing rituals. In the world of the Sylvan Realm, such careful harvests allowed the magic to flow, nourishing all who lived in harmony with the tree.",

The `enumerate` function is used to generate these indices starting from 1 (as per the problem statement). The `min` function is then used to find the tuple with the smallest value, breaking ties by choosing the one with the smallest index. If no even berries are found, an empty list is returned.\n",

We then sort the list of tuples by the value of the berry and the index. The smallest even berry with the smallest value will be at the beginning of the list.

The list comprehension filters out the berries that are not even. If no even berries are found, the function returns an empty list. Otherwise, the function uses the min function with a custom key to find the smallest even berry and its index.

It keeps track of the smallest even number it has encountered (`min_even`) and the index of this number in the array (`min_even_index`). If it encounters a number that is smaller than `min_even` and is even, it updates `min_even` and `min_even_index`. If no even number is found, it returns an empty list.

If either condition is true, it returns an empty list. Then it creates a list of tuples `even_berries` where each tuple contains the index of the berry (starting from 1) and the value of the berry if the berry is even. If there are no even berries, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it finds the even berry with the smallest value and the smallest index (in case of a tie), and returns a list with the value and index of this berry.

It then filters this list to only include berries that are even. If there are no even berries, it returns an empty list. If there are multiple berries with the same smallest value, it filters this list again to only include the smallest value.

        "question_content": "In the bustling realm of Numeria, ancient guilds vied for influence and recognition. Each guild was composed entirely of like-numbered citizens\u2014some guilds were populous, with their numbers forming massive throngs, while others counted only a few dedicated members. The governing council, ever eager to reward strength in unity, devised a challenge that became both a tradition and a rite of passage for guilds seeking prestige.\n\nEach season, the council revealed a grand ledger\u2014a scroll bearing a sequence of positive integers, where each number represented a citizen\u2019s guild. The same number might appear many times, marking the swelling ranks of a particular group. Though the scroll was always populated with at least one number\u2014no empty announcements here\u2014the challenge remained: only those guilds whose public presence on the scroll was at least as great as the chosen number they represented would be considered for special honors. For example, a guild labeled \"Three\" would be considered worthy only if its members appeared at least three times upon the scroll.\n\nBut of all the guilds that might satisfy this condition, the council sought the mightiest: the greatest-numbered guild whose strength in numbers did not fall short of its own name. If no such guild could be found in that year's scroll, the council declared the quest unfulfilled, and the reward unclaimed.\n\nThis quest was enacted via a ritual. When the grand ledger was revealed, the task was as follows: take a scroll listing the guild numbers of every noted citizen. Divine the highest guild for which its membership count equaled or surpassed the value of the guild\u2019s own name. Announce to the council the noble number of this guild\u2014should one exist who meets this mark. If not, make known their absence with the number negative one, for this signaled that no guild was both large and grand enough to claim the honor that year.\n\nFor instance, in the year when the scroll read \u201cFour, One, Two, Two, Three, One\u201d, the assembly noted that the guild labeled \"Two\" appeared twice, which met its own standard, and no higher-numbered guild could do so. Thus, the answer was \"Two.\" In a different season, the scroll bore \u201cOne, Two, Two, Three, Three, Three, Four, Four, Four.\u201d Here, \"Three\" appeared three times, which fit the council\u2019s law, so \"Three\" was the highest qualifying guild. Yet there were years when none proved worthy, such as when \u201cFive, Five, Four, Four, Four\u201d was presented; the council found that no guild\u2019s showing matched or exceeded its name, and so announced \u201cnegative one.\u201d\n\nThus, the council\u2019s ritual operated with the following ceremony: the input to their function was a list of positive integers, each denoting a guild as described above. The council\u2019s herald would pronounce a single number in response: the proudest, greatest guild number that met the condition, or \u201cnegative one\u201d if none could muster enough members. For each season\u2019s declaration, both input and output were clearly noted in this fashion:\n\n    search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) \u2192 2  \n    search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) \u2192 3  \n    search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) \u2192 -1  \n\nSuch was the council\u2019s custom, their challenge echoing through Numeria: honor ever reserved for the greatest guild bold enough to equal the meaning of its name\u2014a tradition shaped as much by ancient numerals as by pride.",

Here\u2019s your narrative transformation, following your guidelines:\n\n---\n\nIn the bustling city of Lexiconia, where words and letters held tangible power, there existed a secret society of Scribes. These Scribes collected scrolls, each inscribed with unique strings of characters, and stored them deep within the city\u2019s grand Library. Only those scrolls containing certain magical runes\u2014special patterns of letters\u2014were believed to hold the secrets to unlocking ancient wisdom.\n\nEach day, the Grand Archivist would present a collection of scrolls to the Scribes, along with a decree: only scrolls that contained a specific rune were to be preserved for the day\u2019s study. The rune could be any sequence of letters, and the Scribes\u2019 task was to sort through the day\u2019s collection, setting aside all scrolls that did not bear the rune\u2019s mark. There were no restrictions on the length or content of a scroll, and the collection offered to the Scribes could range from empty to vast.\n\nThe rules of the Library were simple: for every decree, examine each scroll one by one. If the sought-after rune was found anywhere within the scroll\u2019s inscription, that scroll was deemed worthy and kept. Otherwise, it was quietly returned to the archives. The Scribes were trained to perform this ritual as swiftly and thoroughly as possible, ensuring no worthy scroll was overlooked and no unworthy scroll slipped through.\n\nAt sunrise, the Archivist would announce both the day\u2019s collection and the rune to be sought. The Scribes\u2019 findings were then returned as a list of scrolls that contained the given rune. The process was precise: first, the Scribes would be told how many scrolls to expect, followed by the inscription on each scroll, and finally, the rune to search for. When their work was done, they would present a list\u2014sometimes empty, sometimes filled with scrolls\u2014of all those preserved.\n\nFor example, on a quiet morning, if no scrolls were presented and the rune decreed was the single letter 'a', the Scribes would return an empty list, having found nothing to preserve. On another day, if the scrolls bore the inscriptions \"abc\", \"bacd\", \"cde\", and \"array\", and the rune sought was again 'a', the Scribes would keep only \"abc\", \"bacd\", and \"array\". The scroll \"cde\" would be set aside, as it bore no trace of the rune.\n\nAnd so, the daily ritual continued in Lexiconia\u2019s Library, with Scribes ever vigilant, filtering the wisdom of ages one rune at a time\u2014ensuring that only the scrolls marked by the chosen rune were pulled from the endless archives for study.\n\n---",

        "question_content": "In the distant land of Numeria, there exists a curious tradition each time the villagers gather for the Festival of Lists. Here, a council of sages is presented with a scroll bearing a sequence of enchanted numbers. The festival\u2019s ancient oracle then demands that the council reorder these numbers not in the usual ascending or descending fashion, but through a ritual known as The Strange Sort.\n\nAccording to the customs of Numeria, The Strange Sort follows a peculiar logic. The process commences with the smallest number in the scroll, denoting humility\u2019s start. Once the smallest has been chosen, the council must ignore it and select, from the remainder, the largest. Thereafter, the council repeats this ritual: always choosing the smallest remaining number, followed by the largest, alternating back and forth, until every number has found its place in the new sequence. No participant is called upon more than once, and the order of appearance is set in stone by this alternating dance of extremes.\n\nYour challenge in this tale is simple yet vital to the festivities: when presented with any scroll\u2014be it completely blank, filled with identical runes, or inscribed with wild variety\u2014you must perform the ancient ritual. Reorder the numbers according to Numeria\u2019s rules, creating the most precise and celebrated example of The Strange Sort for your given scroll.\n\nTo uphold tradition, the Festival records all scrolls by listing their rune numbers in square brackets separated by commas. Your task is to receive such a scroll\u2014represented as a single list of integers, such as [2, 7, 5, 1]\u2014and, through Numeria\u2019s ordering ritual, present the new strange-sorted scroll, again as a list, in the very same format. When a scroll is empty, return it unchanged; when all numbers are the same, the ritual has no effect, and the result mirrors the input; but for scrolls with more spirited diversity, the festival demands the dance of minimum and maximum continues until every number is placed.\n\nLet the chronicles show a few celebrated instances:  \n- At one festival, the scroll [1, 2, 3, 4] was rearranged as [1, 4, 2, 3], starting with the humblest, then boldest, and so forth.  \n- On another day, a scroll with all numbers bearing the same mark, like [5, 5, 5, 5], remained unchanged after the dance, since all extremes were equals.  \n- Of course, a blank scroll\u2014[]\u2014is returned untouched, for there are no runes to weave.\n\nThus, each year, the Festival of Lists continues, and the council entrusts to the next generation the simple mandate: transform any input scroll (list) into its Properly Strange Sorted form, following the sacred Numerian tradition. Perform the ritual, record the resulting list, and further the legacy of wise order in this whimsical land of numbers.",

        "question_content": "In the heart of the ancient kingdom of Trigonoria, there stood a mystical council known as the Geometrarchs. They were entrusted with measuring the sacred territories inside the triangular groves scattered across the land. For this, the Geometrarchs relied on a tradition: to determine the territory of a triangle, they needed the lengths of its three borders. These borders could be any positive numbers, provided by adventurers and surveyors coming from far and wide.\n\nYet, the council followed strict laws passed down from Elders long past. For three borders to encircle a grove and claim its territory, the land must satisfy a sacred test: no border could ever stretch so perilously long that the sum of the other two could not surpass it. If even once a lone border bested the combined length of its companions or even matched it, the supposed triangle grove would dissolve into myth, and the Geometrarchs would decree it invalid, marking their scroll with a code of negative one to signify its non-existence.\n\nShould the borders pass this test, the council would then draw upon their legendary knowledge to calculate the exact essence\u2014what they called the \u201carea\u201d\u2014enclosed within. Their calculation was precise, and their scribes were ordered to record this measurement to exactly two points past the decimal, using their unique geometric glyphs for clarity and uniformity. This permitted fair comparison among all claimed groves. However, only valid tracts\u2014those that adhered to the ancient triangular decree\u2014would be measured; pretenders were cast aside with a mark of nullity.\n\nWhen travelers sought the council\u2019s wisdom, they would come forth with three numbers\u2014representing their borders\u2014speaking them aloud. The Geometrarchs, in turn, would declare either the precisely rounded area if the borders were worthy, or the code of negative one if the borders violated the law. The process was universal, no matter if the borders were three, four, and five steps long, or one, two, and ten steps, for example.\n\nTo illustrate, an envoy once arrived and proclaimed borders of lengths three, four, and five. After chanting their incantations, the Geometrarchs replied with a solemn, \u201cSix point zero zero.\u201d Another emissary, boasting borders of just one, two, and ten, was met with a stern, \u201cNegative one,\u201d as their borders could not possibly form a sacred triangle. Thus, every claim, regardless of its ambition, underwent the same ancient test; every response was given in kind: a rounded area if valid, or a decree of nullity if not\u2014maintaining order in the ever-expanding, sacred groves of Trigonoria.",

        "question_content": "In the distant land of Aeronautia, inventors and tinkerers dream of seeing their prized creations soar across the legendary Skyway. Each hopeful inventor is allowed to submit a single contraption to The Grand Ascension, a yearly festival where flying objects earn unparalleled glory. Now, these objects are no ordinary machines\u2014they are comprised of a series of enchanted weight-stones, each marked by a unique number denoting its weight.\n\nBut the guild of Sky Judges have instated two ironclad rules, whispered in every workshop. First: a contraption may only rise if it possesses perfect equilibrium\u2014meaning, its design must be symmetrical such that the arrangement of weight-stones reads identically from nose to tail as from tail to nose. Should the pattern falter, the object is deemed \"unbalanced\" and is forbidden to ascend, no matter how light or beautiful.\n\nSecond, the sum total of its weight-stones must not exceed the maximal lift threshold set by the Sky Judges, a number determined before the festival begins and inscribed onto each submission scroll. Even if the design achieves harmony, a contraption that is too heavy for this threshold will never take flight.\n\nInventors who wish to enter must present two critical details to the Judges: the sequence of enchanted weights in their contraption, and the greatest weight the Skyway can support\u2014recorded as a single list of numbers and a solitary number respectively, written upon the registration parchment. If both the symmetry and weight conditions are met, the object's fate is sealed to soar; otherwise, it must remain grounded.\n\nLet us ponder a few entries from the annals of Aeronautia:  \n\u2013 When bold Ada submitted [1, 2] with a threshold of 5, her creation failed. Though the device was light enough, its asymmetry left it earthbound.  \n\u2013 Jasper tried [3, 2, 3] against the modest threshold of 1. His matching ends were promising, yet the cumulative weight far surpassed permissible bounds, and thus it could not fly.  \n\u2013 The creative Luna sent forth [3, 2, 3] with a much more generous limit of 9. Here, both required conditions\u2014palindromic beauty and liftable weight\u2014were satisfied, so her object soared high.  \n\u2013 Last, Miko entered a minimal design [3] with a threshold of 5. With perfect balance (as all single-stone arrangements naturally possess) and weight below the limit, it too achieved flight.\n\nThus, in the wondrous Aeronautia, only contraptions that are both symmetrical in design and sufficiently light may conquer the sky. Whenever inventors submit their pair\u2014a list of weight-stones, and a skyway threshold\u2014the Judges return a declaration: *True* for those blessed to fly, *False* for the rest, as in the examples above.",

        "question_content": "In the enchanted land of Mirrovielle, the inhabitants cherish a peculiar tradition every lunar festival: the Grand Parade of Reflections. Along the Moonlit Avenue, townsfolk arrange themselves in a straight line, each person wearing a robe of a certain color. The spectacle is admired most when its symmetry mirrors the moon\u2019s calm face\u2014meaning the order of robe colors is the same when gazed upon from either direction. This perfect arrangement is famed as the \u201cPalindrome Procession.\u201d\n\nHowever, the villagers often find that, due to the randomness of assignment, the initial arrangement seldom achieves this harmonious balance. It is a standing custom that any individual may swap their robe for any other color, but every change\u2014be it dye, borrow, or weave\u2014is a task to be minimized, for each alteration weaves a ripple in the traditional tale. The village elders, measuring both beauty and efficiency, challenge the townsfolk: what is the least number of robe changes needed to create a procession that reads the same forwards as it does backwards?\n\nFor every festival, the High Scribe receives a scroll from the Parade Master. This scroll\u2014akin to a wondrous input array\u2014lists, in a precise sequence, the colors each member currently wears, making every detail clear to the wise. The Scribe\u2019s goal, and thus the challenge to any worthy solver, is to carefully analyze this list and determine the smallest number of individuals who must don a new robe color so that when the parade is reflected, it reveals a perfect palindrome.\n\nAt the heart of this tradition lies the ritual itself: for each pair of revelers who stand equally distant from either end of the line, should their robe colors disagree, one\u2014no more\u2014must change, and the total number of such disparities counts up to form the Scribe\u2019s final tally. One is permitted to replace a robe with any other hue, with no restrictions, but the sacred challenge remains to keep the number of disturbances as few as possible.\n\nLet us consider three festival scenarios as scrolls with their corresponding revelations:\n- In the first parade, the sequence of robe colors is [1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]. The Scribe discovers, upon careful pairing from both ends, that four people must seek new robes for the Grand Parade to shimmer with symmetry.\n- During another festival, a line appears as [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]. Only one villager needs to change their robe, for all other pairings already match in chromatic reflection.\n- At times, fortune smiles, as in [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]: here, no villager need trouble themselves, for the procession stands already adorned in perfect palindrome.\n\nAnd so, each year, the Scribe awaits the festival scroll, always noting the initial sequence as the \u201cinput\u201d and recording the minimal count of robe-changes as the \u201coutput.\u201d The tradition endures: reveal the minimum reshaping required to achieve the Grand Parade of Reflections\u2019 cherished symmetry, ever eager for new scrolls and ever ready to preserve the aesthetic equilibrium of Mirrovielle\u2019s moonlit line.",

Then, it counts the number of changes needed to make the array a palindrome. The minimum number of changes is the sum of the counts from the left and right minus one if the color at the current position is the same as the minimum color.\n",

Then, for each `i`, if `left[i]` and `right[i]` are not equal, it means that the color of the `i`-th person does not match with the color of the `n-i-1`-th person, so we need to change their robe color. The total number of changes is returned as the result.\n",

We compare the colors at both ends. If they are the same, we move both pointers inwards. If the color at the left pointer is less than the color at the right pointer, we change the color at the right pointer to match the left pointer and increment the changes counter. If the color at the left pointer is greater than the color at the right pointer, we change the color at the left pointer to match the right pointer and increment the changes counter. We continue this process until the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer. The function then returns the number of changes made.\n",

        "question_content": "In the whimsical domain of Verbatiam, villages were organized not by location or lineage, but by the total syllables spoken in each household. The grand Oracle of Verbatiam presided over the annual Linguistic Festival, where two rival families\u2014each presenting a scroll of their favorite phrases\u2014would compete. These scrolls, filled with strings of words, symbolized the collective wisdom and loquacity of each family. However, the Oracle esteemed brevity as much as wisdom, believing that the family whose scroll had the fewest total letters was the most prudent and deserving of this year\u2019s honor.\n\nTo ensure fairness, the Oracle enforced three sacred decrees. First, she would count every letter in every phrase across each family\u2019s scroll, tallying the cumulative total for each side. Second, if one family\u2019s scroll bore a lesser total count of letters than the other, that family would be honored for their verbal conciseness; their scroll would be placed in the Oracle\u2019s Hall of Distinction. Third, if by rare chance both families had produced scrolls with an identical number of letters, tradition dictated that the first scroll, by order of presentation, would be selected for honor.\n\nBefore the ceremony, town scribes seeking the Oracle\u2019s wisdom would call upon a magical function, providing two collections of phrases\u2014each collection a list from one family\u2014as input. The ancient incantation accepted the scrolls in the form of two lists of strings, and would return, as output, the honored scroll: the list whose sum of letters was less than the other, or the first if there was a tie. If both families presented empty scrolls, the wisdom of the ritual dictated that an empty scroll must also be returned, signifying humility.\n\nTo guide new initiates, the Oracle described various outcomes with illustrative examples. Should both families present nothing (for instance, invoking the magical function with two empty lists), the honored scroll would also be empty. If the first family presented the phrases \u201chi\u201d and \u201cadmin,\u201d and the second brought \u201chI\u201d and \u201cHi,\u201d the winning scroll would be that of the second family, since their scroll required fewer letters in total. When the first family had \u201chi\u201d and \u201cadmin\u201d and the second\u2019s scroll contained \u201chi,\u201d \u201chi,\u201d \u201cadmin,\u201d and \u201cproject,\u201d the Oracle would select the first scroll for its brevity. In the case where the first family\u2019s phrases were \u201chi\u201d and \u201cadmin\u201d and the second\u2019s were \u201chI,\u201d \u201chi,\u201d and \u201chi,\u201d the latter\u2019s scroll, being longer in total, would grant victory to the second family. If the first family brought only \u201c4,\u201d and the second presented \u201c1,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d \u201c3,\u201d \u201c4,\u201d and \u201c5,\u201d the concise single-phrase scroll of the first family would be honored.\n\nThus, the Oracle's tradition persisted: villages competed for the prize of pruned prose, guided by the wisdom of sacred rules dressed in the vestments of family scrolls, syllables, and the revered call of the total_match ceremony. Through every challenge, the function\u2019s input and output preserved the essence of the village\u2019s traditions, pairing ancient logic with the spellbinding nature of the spoken word.",

        "question_content": "In the mystical land of Numeria, the wise scholars at the Grand Arithmetical Guild spent their lives exploring the curiosities of numbers, seeking to unravel the hidden patterns that governed the world. Deep within their ancient library, a curious riddle was inscribed upon a golden tablet\u2014one that only the most astute of minds could hope to solve. This riddle concerned special coins called \"Tri-Prime Talismans,\" which were known for their magical power, but only when forged from the right combination of elements.\n\nThe rules within Numeria were precise. To be recognized as a true Tri-Prime Talisman, a coin must be created by merging together\u2014in a single mystical ritual\u2014exactly three \"prime shards,\" each a mystical fragment that cannot be split except by one and itself. The ritual could use the same or different types of shards, but only three in total could be chosen. However, the law of the realm stated that the resulting coin\u2019s value, when measured, must be less than one hundred standard Numerian units\u2014no more, no less.\n\nAdventurers from every corner of the kingdom would bring their coins to the Guild, eager to receive answers. For each coin\u2014whose value could be any whole number below one hundred\u2014they would ask: \"Is my coin a true Tri-Prime Talisman?\" The head scholar, consulting her scrolls, would reply either with the sacred word for affirmation, or the sober word for denial, depending on whether the coin's value indeed matched the magical requirement: Can it be built by multiplying together three prime shards, in any combination?\n\nYour task, then, is to create an enchanted function for the Guild. This function should accept a single number less than one hundred, representing the coin's value, and return 'true' if and only if the coin could have arisen from combining three prime shards through multiplication, or 'false' otherwise. Remember, the identity of the shards is hidden\u2014you must merely determine if such a combination is possible for the value in question.\n\nThe head scholar always provides examples to new apprentices. For instance: if a hopeful brings a coin worth thirty units, she would say \"true\"\u2014for thirty could be obtained by merging shards with values two, three, and five (since two times three times five is thirty). But were an apprentice to bring a coin with another value\u2014for example, one not built in such fashion\u2014they might hear \"false.\"  \n \nSo, remember the rules of Numeria as you craft your function. The input shall be a single whole number below one hundred; the output must be either 'true' or 'false'. For example, invoking the ritual for a coin with value thirty returns 'true':  \n`is_multiply_prime(30) == True`  \nBecause, in the language of Numeria: thirty comes from two, three, and five\u2014three prime shards exactly. Thus the tradition and logic of Numeria blend into a single, satisfying solution for those who can unravel the Tri-Prime riddle.",

        "question_content": "In the land of Numeria, numbers were far more than mere abstract ideas\u2014they possessed ancient magic, woven deeply into the fabric of the world. Every few decades, seekers from across Numeria would gather at the Tower of Exponents, a place where the secrets of multiplicative power were uncovered and revered. The challenge of \"True Power,\" an age-old rite, was posed to visitors wishing to test the very nature of numbers themselves.\n\nWithin the stone halls, the wise Sage presented the challenge. \u201cFor any two numbers you choose, think of the first one as your \u2018target\u2019\u2014a magical artifact you wish to identify\u2014and the second one as the \u2018source crystal,\u2019 whose innate power might have created it. Your quest is to determine if this artifact could have been formed by multiplying the crystal by itself, over and over again, any whole number of times, beginning always with a single instance of the crystal\u2019s power. If you can show that such relentless multiplication leads exactly to your artifact, you will have deemed it a \u2018Child of Simple Power\u2019\u2014and your answer must be true. If not, then it bears no such lineage, and the answer is false.\u201d\n\nThe rules are as follows: start with just one\u2014representing the teeniest spark of energy. If the source crystal\u2019s magnitude is used, it can be multiplied by itself again and again, but only whole numbers of times, and always without skipping steps or blending different relics. Your artifact is considered a true heir of the crystal only if, after some number of such strict self-multiplications (possibly zero), you arrive at your artifact, with not one measure more or less. If the artifact cannot be shaped in this way using the crystal\u2019s original power, no matter how many times you try, then it stands independent and unknown in its origin.\n\nThe Sage provided a scroll that described how travelers should make their inquiries: \u201cPresent your query with two numbers, both positive\u2014the artifact first, then the source crystal. For each query, I shall return you \u2018true\u2019 if the artifact is indeed a \u2018Child of Simple Power\u2019 of the source crystal; otherwise, \u2018false.\u2019 To aid future generations, all answers must match this exact format.\u201d The function to be uttered in the Tower, as the Sage wrote, is: **is_simple_power(artifact, source_crystal)**.\n\nBy way of illustration: one of the Tower\u2019s acolytes once asked if the artifact numbered one could be shaped from the crystal numbered four. Because multiplying four any number of times\u2014including not at all\u2014could indeed produce one (through the ancient rule that any number to the zeroth multiplication yields one), the answer was \u2018true\u2019. Another sage checked if the relic two could be formed from the crystal two\u2014since using two once is allowed, and yields two, this too was \u2018true\u2019. However, when the relic three was brought forth and compared to the crystal two, it was impossible to reach three by multiplying two by itself any number of times. Over and over, multiplication led to only two, four, eight, and so on\u2014never three\u2014so the answer was \u2018false\u2019 in that case.\n\nLastly, so all might understand, the Sage read aloud from the scroll of past inquiries as testimony to the system\u2019s logic:\n\n- **is_simple_power(1, 4)** returns **true** (for one is always a true power of any crystal).\n- **is_simple_power(2, 2)** returns **true** (for two is two to its first multiplication).\n- **is_simple_power(8, 2)** returns **true** (for eight is two to the third multiplication).\n- **is_simple_power(3, 2)** returns **false** (for three cannot be formed by doubling any whole number of times).\n- **is_simple_power(3, 1)** returns **false** (since only one can ever arise from repeating itself).\n- **is_simple_power(5, 3)** returns **false** (five is not on the path of multiplying three by itself).\n\nThus, so long as the Tower stands, seekers are invited to submit their queries in this way, and the scroll of logic shall always return the truth of the numbers\u2019 lineage.",

        "question_content": "In the mystical land of Numeria, there existed an ancient order known as the Cubalists. The Cubalists were seekers of numbers that could be stacked into flawless cubes, much like master architects who could build perfect square towers using identical blocks. The elders of Numeria cherished these cube-shaped constructs, believing that only certain numbers could be arranged to form a structure with identical width, length, and height\u2014without leaving a single block unused or misplaced.\n\nWithin Numeria\u2019s archive was a powerful artifact called the Judge\u2019s Scale. The Scale answered a single question: given any number from the scrolls, was it possible for the Cubalists to build a perfect cube structure using exactly that many stones? The rules were absolute. The Cubalists could use either the magic of positive, negative, or even zero numbers of stones. The only condition was that there must exist some integer\u2014positive, negative, or zero\u2014such that, if the Cubalists built a cube with sides of that exact length, the total number of stones used would be precisely the number presented to the Scale.\n\nThe High Scribe\u2019s duty was to probe the artifact with numbers one at a time. Each time, the Scribe would submit a single whole number carved on a slip of parchment. The Scale would respond, declaring either \u201cTrue\u201d if that number matched the total stones needed for some integer-sided cube, or \u201cFalse\u201d if no such integer-sided cube could ever be constructed from that number. The Scribe was told to trust that all numbers carved and offered to the artifact were valid numerals\u2014there would never be need to worry about strange symbols or muddled writing.\n\nThe Scribe\u2019s task, then, was to craft a ritual\u2014called \u201ciscube\u201d\u2014which would receive a number from the Cubalists and, using the wisdom of cubes, tell whether a perfect cubic pile could be formed with that many stones. The ritual would accept a single integer and respond with either the word \u201cTrue\u201d or \u201cFalse,\u201d based on the laws handed down by the founders of Numeria.\n\nFor example, the Cubalists once tested the numbers one, two, negative one, sixty-four, zero, and one hundred eighty. The artifact declared \u201cTrue\u201d for one, as a single block forms a one-by-one-by-one cube; \u201cFalse\u201d for two, as no integer-sided cube uses exactly two blocks; \u201cTrue\u201d for negative one, since even cubes of negative side length are honored by the magic; \u201cTrue\u201d for sixty-four, as it is the exact tally of a cube with side length four (or negative four); \u201cTrue\u201d for zero, for the empty cube is a sacred concept in Numeria; and \u201cFalse\u201d for one hundred eighty, which cannot be constructed from an integer cube. \n\nThus, through this ritual, the Cubalists sought and celebrated the hidden order of their world. They implored future seekers to use the \u201ciscube\u201d incantation\u2014to present a lone integer and await the Scale\u2019s verdict, understanding that only those numbers which can take cubic form shall receive Numeria\u2019s eternal \u201cTrue.\u201d",

The `iscube` method takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it can be represented as the cube of an integer. If `n` is less than 0, the function returns `False`. Then, it starts from 0 and increments `x` until `x**3` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `x**3` equals `n`, it means `n` can be represented as the cube of `x`, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n",

        "question_content": "In the mystical city of Hexaport, every citizen\u2019s worth was measured not by gold, but by the Keys of Primality they carried. Each citizen\u2019s Key was a string of sigils, drawn from the sixteen ancient runes: the numbers naught through nine, and the letters from A to F. These were known as Hexa Sigils, and together, they formed a universal code\u2014one that powered the very magic and machinery of Hexaport. But not all sigils were valued equally: only those infused with the essence of prime numbers were sought by the council of Mages. These prime-infused marks were: the twin, triad, quint, and septem sigils (symbolized as 2, 3, 5, and 7), as well as the powerful Bor (B, for eleven) and Dar (D, for thirteen).\n\nAccording to the laws of the Mages, each Hexa Sigil could only be selected from the elite set of sixteen. Primality, in their ancient tomes, was described as a hidden strength\u2014only those runes corresponding to numbers impossible to be divided into smaller natural factors (beyond the solitary and themselves) were deemed prime. For Hexaport\u2019s purposes, the council decreed that only the six sigils named above embodied this secret power.\n\nEvery month, the High Oracle would present a new Key\u2014a string composed only of those sixteen runes, always in uppercase\u2014and challenge the apprentices to count exactly how many of these rare, prime-infused sigils appeared in the Key. Sometimes, the Key was empty, signifying a failed magical attempt, but otherwise, the Key was always formed correctly.\n\nThe quest for the apprentices was simple, yet strict: when presented with a single Key (encoded as a string), they must carefully tally up all instances of the prime-imbued sigils (those six) and ignore the rest. At the end, they must declare the total count\u2014a number capturing how much primal power that Key contained. This tally was their answer, neither more nor less.\n\nWhenever an apprentice approached the council with their work, the Oracle would read their results aloud in a ritual format: first, she would announce the sigil sequence (the input Key), and next, she would speak the final count (their output), bold and clear. For instance, if the Key shown was \u201cAB\u201d, the count would be announced as one, since only Bor (B) among \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d holds primal worth. If presented with \u201c1077E\u201d, the council would honor two instances\u2014septem appearing twice. When the grand Key \u201cABED1A33\u201d was given, four sigils (Bor, Dar, triad, triad) were counted. And if the city\u2019s grand vault produced the Key \u201c123456789ABCDEF0\u201d, the tally would rise to six. Even in the shadow year marked \u201c2020\u201d, two sigils bore the mark of primality.\n\nThus, in Hexaport, counting prime-imbued sigils within any offered Key was more than a test\u2014it was a celebration of the city\u2019s ancient logic, repeated in every rite by all who sought the wisdom of primal strength.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeralia, there stood an ancient Library of Conversions\u2014a place famed across the land for its magical ability to translate numbers from one tongue to another. The denizens of Numeralia spoke two dialects: the classic Decimal, with ten spoken symbols, and the sleek Binary, whose messages were always delivered in a stream of only two runes: zero and one. The Council of Codekeepers who maintained the Library took great care in establishing the sacred protocols by which any number, written in Decimal, might be faithfully converted into its Binary representation.\n\nEach time a townsfolk approached the Library with a Decimal number in hand, the Gatekeepers would remind them of the traditional specifications. The result of their translation ritual was not to be a loose string of binary runes, but rather a scroll sealed at both ends with a distinctive pair of sigils: the letters \"db.\" These sigils, known as the \"double barriers,\" signaled to all of Numeralia that what lay between was the true binary essence of the number\u2014that, and nothing else, encased securely for all to recognize and trust.\n\nThe process was straightforward in its logic, but precise in its execution. A visitor would provide a single number\u2014their chosen Decimal value\u2014at the Library\u2019s threshold. The Codekeepers would then inscribe the scroll, first marking the leading sigils, then translating the number into Binary through their customary rite\u2014dividing again and again, marking down ones and zeros\u2014until the last rune was placed. With the trailing sigils appended, the scroll was then declared complete.\n\nWhat, then, was the challenge handed to those learning the Library's ways? It was this: for any Decimal number brought to you, inscribe its Binary form onto a scroll, ensuring both the beginning and end bore the \u201cdb\u201d seal. The scroll must display nothing except these double barriers enclosing the correct, unbroken string of ones and zeros that represented the number\u2019s Binary spirit. The function you\u2019re to imagine\u2014\u201cdecimal_to_binary\u201d\u2014accepts a single number as input and must return a string as output, its central portion the number\u2019s binary form, and its bookends the protective sigils.\n\nTo help the apprentices, the Masters kept examples in their tomes. Should a citizen deliver the number fifteen, the output must be a scroll reading \u201cdb1111db\u201d\u2014for the Binary of fifteen is four ones in a row, securely enclosed. Should the ritual be performed with thirty-two, the scroll would plainly read \u201cdb100000db,\u201d as thirty-two\u2019s Binary tongue spoke a single one followed by five zeros. In each case, the \u201cdb\u201d sigils begin and end the record, with the Binary song sung clearly in the middle.\n\nThus, the mystic Library\u2019s ways remain preserved. The tradition is clear\u2014every Decimal number, when transformed, must emerge as a scroll protected front and back by \u201cdb,\u201d with every Binary digit standing precisely in its proper place, neither a rune more nor less. And so, the keepers of Numeralia ensure that knowledge travels safely and truly between the old dialect and the new.",

Here is the requested narrative transformation:\n\n---\n\nIn the tranquil realm of Arithma, two ancient guilds\u2014the Summators and the Multipliers\u2014have long safeguarded the secrets of combining magical stones. Each stone bears a distinct number, and the art of merging their powers is both a tradition and a practical necessity for the kingdom\u2019s magical engineers.\n\nWhenever a novice approaches the Guild Hall, they are presented with a pouch containing a selection of stones. The council\u2019s decree is clear: the Summators must gather the essence of every stone to conjure a single spark whose intensity is equal to the total of all the numbers present. Meanwhile, the Multipliers must weave the stones\u2019 energies together so that the force of their combined resonance is as great as the result of multiplying all their numbers. Should the pouch be empty\u2014a rare, but not unheard of occurrence\u2014the Summators, ever pragmatic, declare the spark\u2019s intensity to be nothing. The Multipliers, rooted in ancient traditions, hold that the resonance, in absence of any stones, remains pure, undisturbed, and thus equal to one.\n\nA novice\u2019s challenge is always the same: given a selection of stones (which may be none at all), they must return to the council with two answers. The first is the spark\u2019s intensity as deemed by the Summators. The second is the resonance as determined by the Multipliers. The council demands efficiency\u2014no stone should be considered more than once, and the results must always be accurate, no matter how many or how few stones are offered.\n\nFor clarity, the Council\u2019s scribes dictate the rules of the trial in their ledgers. The novice will be given a list of numbers, each representing the magical value of a stone. The apprentice must return, in order, the total intensity (sum) and the total resonance (product) as a pair. Should the novice be given no stones, the returned intensity must be nothing, and the resonance must be one. Otherwise, the calculations depend purely on those provided numbers.\n\nTo ensure understanding, the scribes provide these ceremonial examples:  \nShould the pouch be empty, the novice must reply with a scroll reading \u201c0, 1\u201d\u2014for no stones means no intensity, and resonance remains undisturbed.  \nIf the pouch contains stones marked one, two, three, and four, the answer should read \u201c10, 24\u201d\u2014since the spark\u2019s intensity is the total of all numbers, and the resonance is the result of their multiplication.\n\nThrough these rituals, the novice learns not only the arithmetic of Arithma, but also the importance of tradition, clarity, and precision in every magical endeavor.",

Here, the wise Archivists summon strings of magical glyphs, testing each to see if it possesses the legendary aura of \"happiness.\" Only the happiest of strings can open the gates to the festival\u2019s innermost chamber, revealing secrets long guarded by the city\u2019s oldest memories.\n\nIn Lexiconia, the laws for determining a string\u2019s happiness are strict and unwavering. The Archivists have decreed that a candidate string must not be too short\u2014only those glyph ribbons that contain at least three runes are believed to possess any real energy. Furthermore, as the string is unfurled and examined from start to end, every set of three runes in a row must each be different symbols, for sameness in triplets is thought to sap a string\u2019s joy. Should any cluster of three consecutive glyphs repeat even one symbol, gloom overtakes the string, and it cannot be called happy.\n\nYour journey is to stand among the Archivists and judge a given string\u2014let\u2019s call it a ribbon of runes\u2014deciding whether it shines with happiness or fades with gloom. For each string, you will be handed only the glyphs (that is, the string itself) as input, and you will be expected to reply with a single truth: \u201cTrue\u201d if the ribbon is happy, \u201cFalse\u201d otherwise. Take heed\u2014margin for error is small in Lexiconia\u2019s traditions.\n\nTo train newcomers, the Archivists offer a scroll of examples. Suppose you are given a ribbon bearing the glyph \u201ca.\u201d This single-symbol ribbon is too short to be happy, so \u201cFalse\u201d is the verdict. If the ribbon stretches to \u201caa,\u201d the result is still \u201cFalse,\u201d for a pair is odd but not joyous. The ribbon \u201cabcd,\u201d on the other hand, has enough length, and examining the clusters\u2014\u201cabc\u201d and \u201cbcd\u201d\u2014each gleam with wholly distinct symbols, so the judgment is \u201cTrue.\u201d For \u201caabb,\u201d however, the ribbon fails; among its triplets (\u201caab,\u201d \u201cabb\u201d), repeating runes appear, and thus, \u201cFalse\u201d rings out. A ribbon marked \u201cadb\u201d brings joy, for the triplet \u201cadb\u201d uses different runes; \u201cTrue\u201d is the outcome. But \u201cxyy,\u201d despite seeming mysterious, repeats the \u201cy\u201d and ends in sorrow, \u201cFalse.\u201d\n\nThus, in the chamber of the Archivists, the ritual is set: You will be handed a ribbon as input and deliver your solemn answer\u2014\u201cTrue\u201d or \u201cFalse.\u201d Here are the rites in practice:\n\n- Input: a (verdict: False)\n- Input: aa (verdict: False)\n- Input: abcd (verdict: True)\n- Input: aabb (verdict: False)\n- Input: adb (verdict: True)\n- Input: xyy (verdict: False)\n\nLong live the happiness of Lexiconia\u2019s ribbons, and may your judgments echo with truth through the Hall of Echoes!",

        "question_content": "In the storied halls of Heliantheia Academy, a prestigious school soaring above the clouds, the fate of young scholars is determined by the enigmatic council of Eleven. Each year, when the sun sets on the semester, the council convenes to bestow upon each student a parchment scroll bearing a symbol\u2014a mark from the sacred Alphabet Scrolls\u2014which defines their standing within the academy for the year to come. The process is said to be guided by an ancient, precise doctrine known only to the council, kept secret in a hidden vault. Yet, one year, the revered Head Sage misplaces the critical tome that held the translation of numerical essences\u2014the GPAs\u2014into the symbolic alphabet, plunging the council into brief disarray.\n\nThe council\u2019s doctrine was famed for its rigor: a perfect numerical essence, represented as the highest value, granted the blessed symbol of \u201cA+.\u201d Slightly less perfect, yet still remarkable, earned \u201cA,\u201d with each subsequent, diminishing level of essence demarcated by a subtly transforming letter-symbol. The transformation occurred at thresholds: for example, those above three and seven-tenths per the register, but not reaching four, found themselves with an \u201cA;\u201d above three and three-tenths but not as high as the previous, received \u201cA-.\u201d This process continued, stepwise, with each interval between thresholds guarded by symbol pairs like \u201cB+,\u201d \u201cB,\u201d then \u201cB-,\u201d and so on, all the way to \u201cE,\u201d which was reserved for a total lack of brilliance.\n\nThis year, with the doctrine lost, the Head Sage turned to you, the Lore Keeper, entrusting you with a scroll of students\u2019 numerical essences. The task was clear: using the remembered knowledge of the council\u2019s thresholds\u2014twelve in all\u2014you must translate each number on the scroll to its appropriate symbol from the Alphabet Scrolls. For every essence that matched the highest possible mark, bestow \u201cA+.\u201d For each that fell between two divine ticks on the scale, assign the fitting letter-symbol based on the highest threshold it surpasses.\n\nYour role is to craft a method\u2014here, you must create a function called \u201cgrade_equation\u201d that accepts a roster, in list form, of students\u2019 numerical essences. This method will return a new scroll in the same order, but with each essence replaced by the corresponding alphabet symbol. For clarity: you will receive the input as a list of numerics, and you will output a list of alphabet-encoded standings, echoing the order of the original scroll. \n\nTo guide you, the Head Sage reminisces about a sample scroll. Suppose the scroll of essences read: four, three, one and seven-tenths, two, and three and five-tenths. The translation, as per the sacred thresholds, would yield: \u201c[A+, B, C-, C, A-],\u201d with each letter-symbol granted according to the doctrine\u2019s steps\u2014each essence checked against the intervals until the best possible mark is assigned, and no less.\n\nThus, as you toil in the candlelit scriptorium, remember: for every scroll of numbers you receive, your task is to faithfully encode each, honoring the legacy of the council and the unbroken tradition of Heliantheia Academy. Your ledger must take, for example, \u201c[4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]\u201d and transform it into \u201c[A+, B, C-, C, A-],\u201d as legend and custom demand.",

This method takes a list of grades as input and returns a list of corresponding letter grades. The grades are mapped to their corresponding letter grades using a dictionary `grade_scale`.

The function iterates over the grade scale in reverse order and returns the corresponding letter grade as soon as it finds a grade that is greater than or equal to the current numerical grade.

Each scroll, woven from silk threads imbued with magic, required a certain charm of integrity \u2014 not just any length of weaving would suffice. Only scrolls whose lengths matched the mysterious numbers revered by the League of Primes could unlock the legendary Chamber of Secrets, a place where the greatest stories resided. These prime numbers, known only by their indivisibility by lesser numbers, were considered gateways to wisdom only a select few could access.\n\nThe wise caretakers of the library established an unspoken edict among the scribes: when crafting a new scroll \u2014 be it a legend, a poem, or a recipe \u2014 one must always count the symbols woven into the silk. If the total number of symbols was a solitary thread, or such that no other grouping besides unity and itself could divide it perfectly, that scroll would receive a golden seal, symbolizing its prime worthiness. Scrolls failing this test, perhaps falling into even stacks or divisible heaps, were left unsealed, waiting for their transformation.\n\nTo assist the scribes, a magical tool was forged: it was invoked by offering the scroll\u2019s woven symbols as input, and it would respond with a single truth \u2014 either an affirmation that the scroll bore a prime length or a denial if not. The magical invocation, called upon as prime_length followed by the symbol-weaving, would assess the scroll instantly. A response of True declared the scroll worthy for the Chamber; False left it outside, among the archives of the ordinary.\n\nFor the careful guidance of apprentices, the masters recorded a codex of exemplary invocations and their fates: When the phrase \u2018Hello\u2019 was presented, its five characters (for five is revered among the League of Primes) won the golden seal, and the tool whispered True. The palindrome \u2018abcdcba\u2019, with seven symbols, was also celebrated, for seven was equally prime and thus returned True. Likewise, the seven-symbol word \u2018kittens\u2019 earned the same honor. However, when the traveler offered the six-symbol fruit 'orange', the tool judged it unworthy \u2014 for six, being divisible into even pairs and threefold trios, could not pass the test, and so the verdict was False.\n\nThe magic scroll demanded each invocation be of the following form: prime_length(scroll_content), with the reply always being either True or False. Masters insisted that scribes present their work using that format, ensuring uniformity in the magical judgments of worthiness. \n\nAnd ever after, new stories in Lexica found their place among legends, so long as the scribes counted their symbols with care, seeking the approval of the chamber\u2019s ancient magic. For only scrolls of prime length could open the doors to infinity.",

The method uses a helper function `is_prime` to check if the length of the string is a prime number. The helper function works by checking if any number from 2 to the square root of the input number divides it evenly. If it finds any such number, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is not prime. If it doesn't find any such number, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is prime.

These scrolls, known as Digit Chronicles, were bound by a single law: every Chronicle must feature a precise number of glyphs, lined up edge to edge, with each glyph representing a numeric symbol. The length of a Chronicle was called its digit-length, often whispered among scribes as N.\n\nThe Council set forth a peculiar challenge. They wished to know: in all of Numeria, among all the possible Chronicles precisely N glyphs long, how many could claim the mark of the Order of One? A Chronicle earned this mark if its very first or final glyph was the symbol \"1.\" Yet, the Council insisted on a crucial rule\u2014no Chronicle could begin with a blank or a zero. Only proper positive numbers could bear their mark, and no glyph could stray from its place.\n\nThe scribes noted further: only Chronicles where each glyph was plucked from the ten sacred symbols (from zero to nine, inclusive) were allowed. However, the first glyph was never allowed to be zero; every other glyph could be any symbol. The Council\u2019s goal was clear: count all such N-glyph Chronicles that start or end with the symbol \"1,\u201d making sure not to count those that would\u2014through a magical twist\u2014both start and end with \"1\" two times. Efficiency was prized above all; the scribes had to perform this counting with utmost care and speed, especially when N reached dizzying heights.\n\nA missive arrived at the Scriptorium, penned in the ancient input-output tongue. The Scribes were instructed to craft an incantation\u2014taking as input a single positive number hidden under the name N, representing the length of a Chronicle. The answer\u2014a single number\u2014would be their output: the count of all valid N-glyph Chronicles that start or end with the symbol \"1.\" Each Chronicle\u2019s length, and the tally to report, was to be delivered on separate lines.\n\nTo guide the Scribes, the Council sent forth examples, encoded thus:\n```\nInput\n2\nOutput\n19\n```\nIn Numerian terms, Chronicles of length two could be fashioned in one of nineteen ways so that their first or last glyph would be \"1.\" The Scribes realized, for lengths of two, these valid Chronicles included those like \"10\" and \"11\" and so forth, but never double-counted \"11.\"\n\nThus, the challenge to Numeria\u2019s Scribes was clear: for any Chronicle length N presented, respond with the precise tally of all the Chronicles that begin or end\u2014**or both**\u2014with the single, mystical \"1.\"",

The base cases are when n is 1 and 2, where the number of ways is 2 and 19 respectively. For n > 2, the number of ways is calculated as 2 times the number of ways for n - 1, plus the number of ways for n - 2.

For every noble number between the humble nothingness of zero and the lofty plateau of ten thousand, an assembly would gather in the Great Courtyard, and the number would be presented before the Council of Sages. Each of the number\u2019s individual glyphs\u2014their digits\u2014would be separated, and the magical light within each extracted and tallied.\n\nThe customs of Numeria decreed that the sum of these internal lights\u2014the digits\u2014must never be revealed in the standard numerical language. Instead, as a sign of wisdom and tradition, the Court Alchemists would transform this sum into the ancient tongue of Binary, the language of the Split Moon, representing the sum\u2019s value using only the shadows and light: ones and zeroes. This transformation was called the \u201cBinary Blaze,\u201d and it was considered a sacred cipher.\n\nTo engage in this tradition, a visitor must declare a whole number whose value lies anywhere from zero to ten thousand. The Council would then conduct the Ceremony, dividing the number into its basic glyphs, summing the hidden light inside each, and finally translating this total into the Split Moon language. The visitor would then receive as their answer a tapestry woven only of the two primal symbols: a string of ones and zeros, revealing the ultimate Binary Blaze of their number\u2019s innermost sum.\n\nFor example, if a traveler brought forth the offering of one thousand, the Council would discover that only a single spark resided within\u2014represented as \u201c1\u201d in the Split Moon language. Should another bring one hundred fifty, their sum of six would blaze as \u201c110.\u201d And if one were to present the number one hundred forty-seven, the Council would gather a cache of twelve sparks, which would ignite as \u201c1100\u201d when spoken in the split-tongue.\n\nWhen the Ceremony is invoked, the wise ones expect a solitary integer, written in Numerian fashion (that is, as a whole number). The Court will then quietly return a string woven from the Split Moon\u2019s language\u2014ones and zeroes, with not a single superfluous mark. The ancient scrolls display examples thus:\n\n- Should the visitor present `1000`, the council replies with `\"1\"`.\n- For `150`, the response is `\"110\"`.\n- And, upon `147`, the answer shall be `\"1100\"`.\n\nAnd so, through glyph-splitting, spark-counting, and the arcane Binary Blaze, the Ceremony of the Digitfire continues, guiding all travelers through the secret paths between numbers and moons.",

The binary representation of a number is a string of '0's and '1's, where each '1' represents a power of 2 and each '0' represents a power of 2 that is not present in the number. The binary representation of a number is created by dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The process is repeated with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is then the reverse of the remainders.\n\nThe solution then loops through each character in the binary string. If the character is '1', it appends '0' to the result. If the character is '0', it appends '1' to the result. The result is a string of '0's and '1's that represents the binary representation of the input number, but with '0's and '1's swapped.\n",

        "question_content": "In the distant realm of Numeria, where numbers are not just figures but magical entities, there was an old tradition among the wise Scribes of Calculation. These Scribes treasured lists of enchanted stones, each marked with a unique magical energy\u2014some pulsing quietly with an even hum, others flickering with odd sparks. The Scribes kept careful count of these stones using ancient ledgers, where each position in the list had great significance, for the power of a stone was not determined by its energy alone, but also by where in the sequence it was placed.\n\nWithin the Order, there was a peculiar custom for tallying certain energies. The Scribes believed that only those stones which sat in odd-numbered positions\u2014according to the ledgers' ancient method, where the first stone held the place of zero\u2014could be truly receptive to secrets. Yet, even among these privileged positions, not every stone was worthy of tribute. Only those stones resting in these odd-numbered spots and brimming with a calm, even resonance could unlock new wisdom when combined.\n\nThus, the challenge was posed to apprentices: Given a collection of magical stones (expressed as an ordered list of natural or mystical energies), choose every stone that both rests on an odd pedestal (that is, the second, fourth, sixth position, and so on, according to Numeria\u2019s custom of counting from the first as zero) and glows with an even energy. The keeper of the list would then gather the energies from these select stones and combine them, seeking the total sum of their calm, even power.\n\nThe calling was clear: faced with a non-empty assembly of energized stones, an apprentice must scan through the collection, and for each stone resting at one of those odd-pedestaled positions, ask whether its energy is an even aura. If so, the energy is drawn away and added to the ever-growing pool. The aim is to gather as much tempered energy as possible, leaving none uncounted. To fulfill the ancient rite, the apprentice should construct a tome (a function) that accepts the list of stone energies and, through the ritual described, returns the total combined even energy from stones at the sought positions\u2014no more, no less.\n\nFor the records, the inputs and outputs should be presented as follows: The function must be called with an ordered collection of stone energies (integers inside a list, for example, `[4, 2, 6, 7]`). The function should return a single number, representing the total channeled energy from appropriate stones (so, for `[4, 2, 6, 7]`, the result is `2`). This form of record-keeping ensures future apprentices can follow and check the accuracy of your calculation rituals.\n\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s see how the magic works: Given `[4, 2, 6, 7]`, the energies at the ledgers\u2019 odd positions are those at stone-pedestals one and three\u2014holding energies `2` and `7`. Among these, only `2` hums with an even resonance, and thus the total energy gathered is `2`. By honoring these ancient customs, the Scribes ensured Numeria\u2019s traditions endured, guiding each generation of apprentices in the art of selective aggregation.",

        "question_content": "In the distant city of Lexiconia, where wordsmiths and scribes reigned supreme, there existed a curious tradition among the storytellers\u2014one known as the Rite of Sequencing. This rite was not just a pastime but a formal ceremony, performed whenever a sentence was to be recorded in the sacred Tomes of Language. The denizens of Lexiconia believed that words held magical energies, and these energies could best be harnessed when the letters within each word were arranged in proper harmony, determined by an ancient, invisible code that scholars called the Sequence of ASCII.\n\nWithin the bounds of this tradition, a storyteller would take a phrase\u2014be it a poem, a proclamation, or a tale\u2014and preserve the order in which words appeared, as if honoring each speaker\u2019s intent. Yet, before inscribing any word into eternity, the scribe would whisper the Spell of Ordering upon it. The spell\u2019s effect was subtle but absolute: it gently nudged the letters inside each word, ignoring the spaces between, and coaxed them into a queue where each character stood before any that bore a higher value in the old ASCII manuscripts. The result was harmonious: aside from shifting positions within each word according to this ancient order, no word's place in the phrase was altered, and the spaces\u2014vital boundaries of meaning\u2014remained untouched.\n\nThe scribes taught apprentices a particular ritual for this task, known in their tongue as \u201cInvoking the Anti-Shuffle.\u201d Should one wish to bestow this ritual upon a line of speech, they would invoke the incantation as follows: First, provide a string of characters (the \u201cutterance\u201d) to the ritual. The response would be an echo of this utterance, but with each stand-alone word within it transfigured so that its letters, and only its letters, were sequenced in ascending magical value, while the positions of blanks between them were revered as sacrosanct and left as they were encountered. \n\nThis ritual could be performed with a single spell: anti_shuffle(sentence). The utterance, delivered as a string, would return\u2014as if by magic\u2014another string where every word had been ordered from lowest to highest in ancient code, yet all original word and space order preserved. Those consulting the sacred scrolls would find guidance among the examples:  \n- To invoke `anti_shuffle('Hi')` is to say, \u201cThere is but one word, and as its letters are already in serenity, it remains unchanged: the answer is \u2018Hi.\u2019\u201d  \n- For `anti_shuffle('hello')`, the letters would be gently rearranged, yielding \u2018ehllo\u2019, as e is the gentlest letter, followed by h, then two l's and an o.  \n- If the spell were cast on the phrase \u2018Hello World!!!\u2019, the result would be \u2018Hello !!!Wdlor\u2019, for \u2018World!!!\u2019 would see the punctuation rise to the front, followed by the reordering of its remaining letters.\n\nThus it was in the city of Lexiconia\u2014each utterance most efficiently and fully arranged, not by mere shuffling, but by the precise and honoring practice of the Rite of Sequencing, celebrated anew in every invocation of \u201canti_shuffle.\u201d",

        "question_content": "In the distant realm of Polygonia, the land was shaped not by hills and rivers, but by sprawling arrays of chambers. Each corridor in Polygonia\u2019s Great Library was composed of rooms\u2014some long with many doors, others compact with only a few. The Scholar-Council occasionally needed to locate all chambers containing a particular emblem\u2014the mystical rune known as \u201cthe integer.\u201d These runes were scattered throughout the multitude of corridors, and the task of charting their locations fell to the keen-eyed Seekers.\n\nThe method by which the Seekers recorded their findings was strict and ceremonial. Every corridor of the Library was assigned a number, starting from the Grand Entrance Hall numbered zero, counting upward for each new corridor. Within each corridor, rooms too were counted from the beginning\u2014again starting at zero for the first door on the left. However, as the corridors varied in length, one never knew where the emblems might be hidden. For every sought-after emblem, the Seekers must note the corridor and door numbers for all appearances, representing each discovery as a pair of numbers\u2014first the corridor, then the door.\n\nPer the Library\u2019s ancient Order, any log of such discoveries must obey two rules: first, the log\u2019s entries must be ordered so earlier corridors appear before later ones. Second, within the same corridor, Seekers must list room numbers backward, starting from the last door and working to the first, ensuring the mightiest discoveries (the ones furthest along each corridor) came first. The Seekers are tasked with compiling a complete catalogue of every location the rune is found\u2014showing utmost efficiency by making no omission.\n\nThe Seekers always receive, as their input, a curated scroll: a list of corridor-rooms written as nested arrays (symbolizing the corridors and their rooms), and a decree specifying the particular mystical rune to be sought. Their output? A grand ledger: a series of pairs, each a tuple naming the corridor and door numbers precisely as discovered, composed exactly as prescribed by the Library\u2019s Order. If the emblems never appear, the ledger returns empty\u2014an admission of an unsuccessful quest.\n\nLet us glance at some annals from the Seekers\u2019 past. In one storied mission, the corridors contained emblems thus: the first corridor was [1,2,3,4,5,6], the second [1,2,3,4,1,6], and the third [1,2,3,4,5,1]. Tasked with searching for the rune '1', the Seekers dutifully recorded their path as [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]\u2014beginning with the first corridor\u2019s initial door, then listing all high-numbered doors before low ones in each subsequent corridor. Similarly, when the Library was silent and corridors empty, the ledger was likewise empty\u2014no entries made. When faced with corridors like [[], [1], [1,2,3]], and seeking the rune '3', they uncovered a single instance at corridor two, door two, recording simply [(2, 2)].\n\nThus, in Polygonia, the Seekers\u2019 art of discovery is immortalized: a tale of searching every nook, noting every find precisely, and bringing order to the scattered wonders of the realm, just as each coding challenge finds its answer in the logic of the story.",

If it is, it adds a tuple to the result list, where the first element is the index of the list in the original list of lists and the second element is the index of the number in the list.

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeralis, the Order of Arrays holds a curious contest every year: The Sequence Festival. Citizens from all walks of life present sequences of magical stones, each carved with a number. The stones are always non-negative\u2014never bearing the curses of negativity\u2014and range in count from none at all to as many as the bravest citizen dares carry.\n\nThe Order maintains an ancient tradition for determining how sequences are to be celebrated. Each sequence is judged not only by its numbers, but by the mystical relationship between the numbers on its very first and last stones. This relationship is called the \"Sum of Portals,\" for the first and last stones are seen as gateways to a sequence\u2019s soul. According to city law, if the Sum of Portals whispers an odd value, the sequence must dance gracefully from its smallest number up to its largest, in gentle ascent. Should that sum instead be even, the sequence is commanded to leap downward in a proud display, reversing nature to go from largest stone to smallest.\n\nBut, the Order is clear about two rules above all: no original sequence may ever be altered\u2014the celebrations are but performances, their sequences mere reflections. And for stones to be excluded, such as an empty bag or a solitary stone, the answer must honor what was presented: emptiness or the lone number itself remain unchanged, for the festival cannot conjure what is not present or multiply what there is but one of.\n\nWishing to take part, each contestant approaches the registry and submits their set of numbers, one by one, forming a list. The city scribes record these in order\u2014no stone is lost or reordered before the protocol begins. In response, the registry returns a completely new list, showing the gleaming stones sorted according to the Sequence Festival's decree: ascending order for odd Sum of Portals, descending for even, but always leaving the original untouched.\n\nFor the benefit of new arrivals, the registry offers these examples told in the tongue of Numeralis:\n  - If a contestant arrives with an empty pouch, the registry returns it empty.\n  - A soul bearing just one numbered stone, such as [5], receives back a new pouch with the same single number.\n  - Presenting the sequence [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5], where the first stone (2) and the last (5) together summon the odd spirit of 7, the registry returns [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], arrayed from smallest to largest.\n  - For [2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6], the edge sum is 2 and 6, which combine to an even 8; thus, the registry hands back [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], descending in stately order.\n\nThus, all who enter Numeralis's Sequence Festival must abide by these laws, ensuring their sequences are celebrated in reflection and in keeping with the will of the Sum of Portals, sorted as grand tradition demands.",

The `%` operator is used to check if the Sum of Portals is even or odd. If it's even, the `reverse=True` argument is passed to the `sorted` function to sort the array in descending order.

        "question_content": "In the ancient City of Cipheria, messages carried secrets far too precious to trust to ordinary words. The Ciphersmiths, respected artisans of code, devised clever patterns for hiding each syllable\u2019s true spirit. Among their methods, there existed one revered for its balance of elegance and trickery: the Quadshift Cipher, known to turn even an innocent \u201chello\u201d into an enigma only those in the know could break.\n\nWithin these starlit walls, an apprentice would be handed a scroll, each parchment bearing a line of plain speech. The rule of Quadshift, agreed by clever tradition, was delightfully precise: each letter from the kingdom's 26-symbol alphabet\u2014always the familiar sequence from the first symbol up to the twenty-sixth\u2014was to move forward by four positions, for four was twice multiplied by two, no more and no less. Should a letter be nudged past the final symbol, it would wrap merrily back to the beginning. Yet, the citizens\u2019 strange tongues never bent these rules: capital and lowercase distinctions faded, and silent spaces, punctuation, or numbers had no place in Cipheria\u2019s scrolls, for only pure runs of lowercase letters were welcomed.\n\nFor an apprentice aspiring to become a full Ciphersmith, the challenge was set thus: given a scroll inscribed with a whisper of lowercase letters, the Quadshift must be applied so that every letter echoed its true form, nudged exactly four places forward in the eternal ring of Cipheria\u2019s alphabet. For example, upon seeing the humble sequence for \u201ceast,\u201d the wise would take the symbol for \u201ce\u201d and count forward: \u201ce\u201d to \u201ci,\u201d \u201ca\u201d to \u201ce,\u201d \u201cs\u201d to \u201cw,\u201d \u201ct\u201d to \u201cx,\u201d making \u201ciewx.\u201d Every transformed scroll carried an encoded message read only in Cipheria\u2019s rarefied tongue.\n\nThe Ciphersmith\u2019s logbook described the work of the encrypt function, a simple ceremony: it accepts a scroll (a string made of lowercase letters and nothing else) and, following the Quadshift law, returns a freshly-translated scroll, each symbol shifted accordingly. The process never failed\u2014no letter lingered unshifted, no symbol bent the law, and every apprentice saw clearly how one became another.\n\nConsider now a few examples from the annals:  \nIf the apprentice fed the encrypt ceremony the rune-string \u201chi\u201d, the scroll became \u201clm\u201d\u2014with \u201ch\u201d dancing to \u201cl\u201d and \u201ci\u201d to \u201cm\u201d.  \nWhen \u201casdfghjkl\u201d was presented, the return was \u201cewhjklnop\u201d.  \nSimilarly, \u201cgf\u201d was transformed into \u201ckj\u201d.  \nAnd when the scribe tested \u201cet\u201d, their scroll showed \u201cix\u201d.  \n\nThus, every trial in Cipheria followed these enchanting steps\u2014ensuring all messages could be sent, but only the worthy could see through the elegant Quadshift fog.",

If the character is a letter, it calculates the ASCII value of 'a' or 'A' (depending on whether the character is lowercase or uppercase) and subtracts it from the ASCII value of the character. Then it adds 4 to the result and takes the modulus of 26 to ensure that the result is within the range of the 26 letters of the alphabet. Finally, it adds the ASCII value of 'a' or 'A' back to the result and converts the result back to a character to get the encrypted character.

If the character is an alphabet, we calculate the ASCII value of 'a' or 'A' based on whether the character is lowercase or uppercase, and then add 4 to the ASCII value of the character. We then take the modulus of the result with 26 to ensure that we wrap around to the start of the alphabet if the shift takes us past 'z' or 'Z'. Finally, we convert the resulting ASCII value back to a character using the `chr` function and append it to the encrypted text.\n\nThis solution assumes that the input string only contains lowercase letters. If the input string can contain uppercase letters, you would need to add additional code to handle those characters.\n"

        "question_content": "In the luminous realm of Numeria, there exists a winding river known as the Stream of Progress. Along its banks dwell the Countingfolk, a community who cherish the art of record-keeping and seek to track their achievements as life flows ever onward. Each time a Countingfolk accomplishes a task\u2014be it planting a seed, crafting a tool, or sharing a story\u2014they leave a stone with a number carved upon it, marking the magnitude of their latest feat. These stones, placed in a line, form a chronicle of their journey.\n\nAmong the Countingfolk, it is a sacred tradition to remember not just the deeds themselves, but the greatest glory reached at each step. As each new stone is set down, the elders gather to reflect on the mightiest feat achieved so far. No matter how humble or grand the newest number may be, the memory of the greatest previous accomplishment must never be forgotten\u2014each moment is measured against all that came before.\n\nThe elders have decreed a system for this ritual: for every newly placed stone, they create a list that records, step by step, the highest number ever seen up to that point along the riverside path. This list serves as both an inspiring chronicle and a guiding light for future generations, allowing anyone to trace the rise of their achievements through time.\n\nWhenever a new journey along the river is recorded, the Countingfolk must follow precise instructions. To begin, the chronicler is given a scroll, the first line of which states the number of stones to be considered on that path. The second line lists, one by one, the numbers etched into each of the stones, representing the magnitude of each successive accomplishment. The chronicler\u2019s duty is to produce a new list, where each entry reveals the greatest number encountered so far, from the first stone to the last. This process must be followed for each scroll presented, ensuring that every Chronicle of Progress is unbroken.\n\nFor instance, consider a scroll describing a journey with seven stones, each marked with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, and 2. The Chronicle of Progress for this path would read: 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4. At each step, the chronicler looks back and records the highest number seen so far, ensuring that the memory of triumph is never lost, even when smaller numbers appear later. The input to the chronicler is always two lines: the count of stones, followed by the sequence of numbers. The output, just as faithfully, is the Chronicle of Progress\u2014a list of the highest numbers reached at each step along the way.\n\nThus, through careful adherence to this tradition, the Countingfolk of Numeria celebrate each achievement while never letting slip the memory of their grandest moments. Their chronicles not only inspire, but also teach the importance of perseverance and remembrance in the ever-flowing Stream of Progress.",

        "question_content": "In the sun-dappled glen of Everwood, the sprites of the valley gathered each year to hold the Ceremony of the Pebbles. Each sprite would arrive bearing a smooth stone plucked from the forest floor, hints of their journeys still lingering in the subtle hues and etchings upon each pebble\u2019s surface. The tradition was ancient: by comparing the pebbles, the sprites sought wisdom in simplicity, for the smallest stones were said to bring the purest luck.\n\nTo uphold the spirit of fairness, the sprites had agreed on sacred rules for the Ceremony. Each sprite would lay their stone upon the mossy table at the heart of the glen, forming a collection of as many pebbles as there were participants that year. The most treasured honor was not given to the bearer of the very smallest pebble, for that sprite was tasked with the next year\u2019s preparations. Instead, the true prize\u2014knowledge of fortune for the new year\u2014would go to the sprite holding the second-lightest pebble. In rare years when only one pebble or a chorus of identical stones were present, no sprite claimed the honor, and mist graced the woods in gentle silence.\n\nIn this spirit, the sages of Everwood composed a ritual they called \u201cthe seeking of the next truest pebble.\u201d To perform this ritual, the sprites would gather the stones and, by careful observation, determine the second lightest unique pebble among them. If all stones weighed the same, or if there were fewer than two stones placed upon the table, the Ritual Keeper would call the event void\u2014no wisdom would be found that year.\n\nEvery year, the sprites followed this custom as faithfully as the sunrise. An ancient scroll recorded the process for posterity: the function of the Ritual Keeper was to accept a collection of stones, each marked by its own number (input as a list of integers). It would then pronounce either the stone holding the position of second-smallest unique weight (output as an integer)\u2014or, if the ritual\u2019s conditions were not met, to respond with a mystical silence (output as \u2018None\u2019). The scroll even preserved a set of radiant examples, displayed for all young sprites to learn from:\n\n- If the table held the stones numbered [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the Keeper would announce \"2\" as the next truest pebble.\n- Should the stones be [5, 1, 4, 3, 2], again, \"2\" shone as the honored result.\n- When no stones graced the table\u2014[ ]\u2014the woods received only the Keeper\u2019s silence: None.\n- In cases where identical twins laid matching stones, as with [1, 1], the mystic hush of \"None\" would descend.\n\nThus, by the logic of Everwood\u2019s Ceremony, the sprites learned balance\u2014not only in recognizing the lightest step, but in seeking the next to lead the way, unless fate deemed the search unworthy or impossible. So the story of the second-lightest pebble became a cherished lesson, encoded in symbology but reverberating in every glen and grove for centuries hence.",

The method takes a list of integers as an argument. If the list has less than two elements, it returns `None`. If there are two or more elements, it removes duplicates from the list, sorts it in ascending order, and returns the second element (i.e., the second smallest unique number).\n",

If it does, it returns `None` as per the problem statement. If the list has at least two elements, it sorts the list in ascending order and stores the smallest number in the variable `smallest`. It then iterates over the list, returning the first number that is greater than `smallest`. If no such number is found, it returns `None`.\n",

Strangely, the Sentinels have discerned that a clear indicator of growing boredom is when someone, out of nowhere, begins a new thought or declaration with the solitary phrase \"I.\" This habit, so they say, signals personal musings and inward spirals\u2014a sure sign that the mind yearns for something different.\n\nEach day, the Sentinels gather transcripts of conversations, diaries, or even entire soliloquies from the citizens. These musings come strung together as long streams of words\u2014some formal, some casual, some peppered with excitement or confusion. In the written tradition of Phrasia, sentences always end with a punctuation mark that denotes a period of thought, an exclamation, or a question\u2014marked by a dot, a question mark, or an exclamation point, respectively. Between these, ideas can flow uninterrupted, but only these three symbols officially separate each sentence in the realm\u2019s archives.\n\nIt is the duty of the Sentinels to scan these daily records and count, with utmost precision, the number of times boredom is likely to have crept in. Specifically, the Sentinels only mark those sentences that not only begin afresh (right after a sentence-ending symbol or at the very beginning), but also start immediately with the word \"I.\" A sentence for them starts whenever there is either a dot, a question mark, or an exclamation point (including at the very beginning, where no such mark exists yet), and immediately after comes the word \"I,\" signaling a true moment of introspection.\n\nTo streamline this task for the apprentice Sentinels learning their craft, the council has commissioned a special function\u2014*is_bored*. An apprentice is given a scroll of words, perhaps a single line or a multitude, lacking any embellishments: a single string of text. Upon receiving the scroll, they are to determine how many moments of boredom are present, that is, how many times a sentence\u2014separated by those three marks\u2014begins with the word \"I.\" The answer should be returned as a single whole number. For clarity, an apprentice would call upon the task as *is_bored(message)*, where \"message\" is the scroll delivered. For instance: \n\n- If the scroll reads \u201cHello world,\u201d the apprentice would reply, \u201cZero moments of boredom dwell here,\u201d because there is no sentence starting with \u201cI.\u201d\n- Should the message be, \u201cThe sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather,\u201d the apprentice would answer, \u201cOne moment of boredom has crept in,\u201d for only the final sentence starts as the Sentinels dread.\n\nThus do the Sentinels maintain harmony in Phrasia, ever vigilant for signs of ennui\u2014using the wisdom of their function. To reinforce their methodology, they reframe each magical scroll, examining how many times \u201cI\u201d opens a sentence, so they may monitor the pulse of their people and keep the realm lively and awake.",

Every year, the innkeeper, who is renowned for his love of riddles and strict adherence to the ancient laws of arithmetic, presents the trio with a single, sacred challenge.\n\nAccording to tradition, only when all three adventurers are true denizens of the Integer Realms (meaning, their identities are unambiguously whole\u2014no fractions, decimals, or mysterious origins allowed) may they participate in the innkeeper\u2019s trial. The challenge itself is deceptively simple: the innkeeper asks whether it is possible for one among them to serve as the perfect sum of the other two. In other words, he carefully observes if, in any arrangement, a single adventurer\u2019s value is exactly the total power of the remaining duo.\n\nThe rules are inflexible, passed down through generations:  \n- Each participant\u2019s nature must be integer through and through, for outsiders from the Realm of Fractions or the Void of Non-Numbers are strictly forbidden.  \n- The trio is examined for whether any one\u2014be it the first, second, or third adventurer\u2014can claim that their value equates to the precise sum of their two companions.  \n- If either rule falters\u2014the presence of a non-integer, or an inability to match a sum\u2014the verdict is swift and unyielding: they fail the challenge.\n\nTo mediate such gatherings, the high council of Arithmos commissioned a service, described thus: the function `any_int()` welcomes three would-be adventurers through its doors and inspects their credentials through the lens of the realm\u2019s rules. This function expects to receive three values (representing the travelers) as its input. It will return the True token if they belong to the Integer Realms and if any among them could be the sum of the other two. If these conditions are unmet, the False token is given, signaling their ineligibility for the innkeeper\u2019s reward.\n\nFor instance, when the group (five, two, seven) presents themselves, the innkeeper notes that five and two together perfectly match the third, seven, declaring the challenge completed and handing them the True token. Similarly, the trio (three, minus two, one) succeeds because three added to minus two begets one. However, the group (three, two, two) walks away with no reward, as none among them can claim to be the sum of the others, despite all being eligible denizens. When a mysterious traveler, 3.6, appears with compatriots minus 2.2 and 2, the innkeeper swiftly denies them entry\u2014numbers from beyond the Integer Realms are simply not allowed.\n\nThus, at every festival, the denizens of Arithmos know this: entry to the Circle of Sums is only for whole-hearted adventurers, and fortune favors those who embody perfect, harmonious combinations.\n\n---\n\n**Sample Inputs and Outputs (as understood in Arithmos):**  \nWhen calling upon `any_int(5, 2, 7)`, the innkeeper announces: `True` (for 5 and 2 together form 7).  \nSummoning `any_int(3, 2, 2)`, he declares: `False` (none can be written as the sum of the other two).  \nAt the gates, `any_int(3, -2, 1)` receives: `True` (3 plus -2 yields 1).  \nBut for the group `any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2)`, he proclaims: `False` (non-integers are never permitted).",

        "question_content": "In the lettered kingdom of Lingua, messages carried across the land are often intercepted by clever rival spies. To safeguard secrets, the wise Codewrights devised a cryptic transformation system called the Changers' Cipher. This ingenious system distinguishes itself by how it manipulates the written word, turning the ordinary into the arcane.\n\nWithin the boundaries of this cipher, every messenger must obey two key customs. First, the guardians of etiquette dictate that each letter must invert its natural behavior\u2014those with lofty stature (uppercase) must assume humility (lowercase), and those who once stooped meekly (lowercase) must rise up with boldness (uppercase). Second, the vowels\u2014those sociable denizens known as A, E, I, O, and U, whether rising or resting\u2014are never allowed to appear untouched. Instead, each is required to don the name of the fellow who stands precisely two places ahead in the alphabet. If a vowel is shy, it must be emboldened, and if bold, it must restrain itself, but either way, they must claim the identity two steps forward, wrapping around the alphabet's bounds if necessary.\n\nThe chief challenge for the Codewright\u2019s apprentices is as follows: any message must be subjected to this double incantation\u2014first, the swap of every letter's spirit, and second, the metamorphosis of every vowel into the consonantal cloak that is two letters further on. Messages are composed strictly of lettered characters in various cases, never tainted with numbers or symbols; all must be handled according to these sacred rules.\n\nTo enact these rituals, the apprentices receive a single, uninterrupted message\u2014a string of just letters\u2014and must return an enchanted result: the original message, transformed by the Changers\u2019 Cipher, following both the swap and the vowel-forward decree. The apprentice\u2019s function must be capable of transmuting any such string, and must display the outcome as a string just as the input was given.\n\nFor clarity, consider these two secret dispatches intercepted at the kingdom\u2019s gates. First, a whisper that spells out \u201ctest\u201d\u2014after the swapping of form, the only vowel, which began as awake and lowercase, becomes dormant and bolded, but more importantly, it shifts two steps, so 'e' becomes uppercased 'G', with the consonants adjusting their stances accordingly. The outcome, then, is \u201cTGST\u201d. The second message, longer and fraught with vowels\u2014\u201cThis is a message\u201d\u2014is treated in the same meticulous way, yielding \u201ctHKS KS C MGSSCGG\u201d after the cunning implementation of both mandates.\n\nThus, the Changers\u2019 Cipher stands as the guardian of secret words. Each apprentice is tasked to write a code-spell, taking in a string (the messenger\u2019s words) and returning a string (the encoded response), ensuring all letters are swapped in case, and all vowels are cloaked by their letter-fellows two steps forward in the alphabet. As those apprentices now know, to send \u201ctest\u201d through the Cipher yields \u201cTGST\u201d, while \u201cThis is a message\u201d emerges as the even more mysterious \u201ctHKS KS C MGSSCGG\u201d\u2014an elegant assurance that secrets spoken will travel not as they were, but as they must be.",

        "question_content": "Once upon a time in the land of Numeria, there thrived a peculiar guild known as the Primal Scribes. These Scribes believed that the world\u2019s greatest secrets could be unraveled by studying enchanted scrolls, each packed with a wandering flock of mystical numbers. Every scroll was distinct, some filled with humble 0\u2019s, others peppered with rare and powerful creatures known as primes\u2014a breed revered for their indivisibility and independence.\n\nThe laws of Numeria were quite rigid: when an apprentice was handed a scroll, their task was to seek out the most illustrious prime among all the numbers inscribed. The folk tales claimed that only the boldest, largest prime number on a scroll could unlock the Scribes\u2019 treasure. But even that wasn\u2019t enough\u2014once this champion was found, the apprentice had to perform a ritual: they would break the greatest prime down to its core, summing the magic latent in each of its digits, and present the total as an offering to the Scribes.\n\nYour quest is to embody the apprentice. Upon receiving a scroll\u2014a collection of numbers written as a list\u2014you must diligently search through every number, ignoring those that are not truly prime. Among these, you must identify the most powerful prime present. Once found, carefully add together every digit that forms this grand number\u2014the Scribes demand this sum as proof of your worth. If no prime exists on the scroll, the legend is silent on what to do, but you may assume the Scribes would have you declare nothingness.\n\nTo record your offering, you must follow the guild\u2019s traditions. Present the scroll of numbers in a format akin to an array, such as [5, 9, 7, 20, 17]. Your answer to the Scribes is simple: offer a single whole number, the sum of the greatest prime's digits. This ritual must hold even for the most unfathomable scrolls; no matter how many numbers reside\u2014be it a handful or as numerous as ten raised to the fifth power\u2014the logic remains sacred.\n\nLet us walk through examples from the Scribes\u2019 own chronicles. Should you receive a scroll bearing [0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 181, 32, 4, 32, 3, 2, 32, 324, 4, 3], you\u2019d hunt for the greatest prime, find it to be 181, and sum its digits: 1+8+1, resulting in 10. Presented with [1, 0, 1, 8, 2, 4597, 2, 1, 3, 40, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 5, 1], you would uncover 4597 as the mightiest prime and sum: 4+5+9+7 to reach 25. There are other tales, such as scrolls reading [1, 3, 1, 32, 5107, 34, 83278, 109, 163, 23, 2323, 32, 30, 1, 9, 3] where 5107 gives you 13, [0, 724, 32, 71, 99, 32, 6, 0, 5, 91, 83, 0, 5, 6] where 83 brings forth 11, [0, 81, 12, 3, 1, 21] where 3 gives 3, and [0, 8, 1, 2, 1, 7] where 7 itself stands alone, offering 7.\n\nThus, by following the customs of Numeria\u2014seeking strength in primes and honoring them through the cipher of their digits\u2014the Scribes\u2019 apprentices honor the old ways, and the scrolls speak with clarity through the sum of the mightiest magic contained within.",

The `max` function is used to find the maximum prime number in the list, and the `sum` function is used to sum the digits of this maximum prime number.

        "question_content": "In the land of Lexicara, every enchanted chest was sealed with a unique combination of runic words. These runes, etched onto the chest as magical labels, served as the keys to unlock its deepest secrets. For generations, the ancient Order of Scribes established a rule: the magic of a chest could only be invoked if its collection of runic keys was in perfect harmony\u2014all whispers carried in either hushed tones or booming shouts, but never a discordant mixture of both.\n\nAccording to the customs of Lexicara, a chest\u2019s collection of labels would remain sealed to anyone unless every single key inscribed upon it fulfilled a single style\u2014either all runic words spoke in the quiet, gentle script of lower case, or all in the bold, thunderous script of upper case. If the chest had no words at all\u2014if it stood empty and silent\u2014then its secrets would always remain locked. And any intrusion of an object that was not a word, such as a number or symbol among the runes, would cause the chest\u2019s enchantment to fizzle instantly; only strings of words shaped the true key.\n\nYour role as the Sage of Lexicara is to pass judgment on any given chest of keys (represented in the world as an association between runic words and treasures), declaring whether its combination of labels fulfilled the ancient harmony, thus signaling that it could, in theory, be opened. To communicate with the Oracle of Logic, you are tasked with crafting a message\u2014a function that assesses the chest\u2019s collection of keys and delivers a truth-stone: either *True* (if the harmony is perfect and the chest is potentially openable) or *False* (if the rules are broken, if the chest is empty, or if even a single key is out of place).\n\nThe Sage\u2019s ritual proceeds as follows: present the chest as a mapping (for example, a dictionary of words and their corresponding treasures), and the Oracle will respond with either *True* if all keys are words of one style (all lower case, or all upper case), or *False* otherwise (including if there\u2019s at least one non-word among the keys, or the chest is completely bare). For clarity, let\u2019s recall the way ritual requests and replies are presented:  \nIf the collection is `{\"a\":\"apple\", \"b\":\"banana\"}`, the Oracle returns `True`.  \nIf it is `{\"a\":\"apple\", \"A\":\"banana\", \"B\":\"banana\"}`, the answer is `False`.  \nFor `{\"a\":\"apple\", 8:\"banana\", \"a\":\"apple\"}` (where a number has intruded among the runes), the Oracle returns `False`.  \nA named chest like `{\"Name\":\"John\", \"Age\":\"36\", \"City\":\"Houston\"}` is considered discordant and receives a `False` judgment.  \nHowever, should the chest proudly bear only upper-case runes such as `{\"STATE\":\"NC\", \"ZIP\":\"12345\" }`, the answer is `True`.\n\nIn summary, your ritual flow is: provide the chest\u2019s keys (as a mapping or dictionary structure, containing only string keys), and read the Oracle\u2019s reply (a single *True* or *False* value on each line). If the chest is empty, or if a single error in the keys\u2019 style exists, the Oracle\u2019s answer is *False*. Let these traditions guide your way and ensure your journey through the runic archives of Lexicara is well-ordered and wise, with every chest judged in accordance to the ancient harmony.",

        "question_content": "In the ancient kingdom of Numeria, scholars believed that certain numbers possessed an invisible, untouchable strength\u2014known as \"primality.\" These special numbers, the primes, could only be divided by the number one and themselves, eluding common factors that befriended their neighbors. The wise Sage sought to collect these coveted numbers for study and to ensure the kingdom\u2019s knowledge remained ever-sharpened.\n\nAccording to the sage\u2019s gathering rituals, a number, described by the mysterious word \u201cn,\u201d would be whispered to her each morning. She would never receive a negative value\u2014it was always zero or greater. Each day, the sage\u2019s job was to find all the sacred prime numbers that were less than this number \u201cn.\u201d No primes equal to or larger than \u201cn\u201d would be considered, for the spirits decreed strict boundaries be maintained.\n\nHer task was further refined by logic passed down through generations: for any number n brought to her, she would carefully list the prime numbers, starting from the smallest, growing only up to just before n. If n was so small that no primal energies could gather\u2014like n being zero or one\u2014then the sage would return an empty parchment, for there were simply no primes to record. Conversely, for large values of n, she would work tireless hours, ensuring her list was as complete as possible, from the beginning (two, the first prime), up until just less than n.\n\nTo communicate her findings, the sage required a scroll divided into two sections: input and output. The input, a solitary non-negative whole number (her morning whisper of n), and the output, a lined record of all primes discovered\u2014written in order upon the parchment as a single list, empty if none were found. For instance, if the morning whisper was five, her reply would be a simple scroll inked with [2, 3]. Should she hear eleven, her answer was four numbers: [2, 3, 5, 7]. A whisper of zero or one earned a clean, unmarked sheet: [].\n\nHere are some recorded scrolls from the sage\u2019s vault: When asked with five, she wrote [2, 3]. With eleven, she penned [2, 3, 5, 7]. Zero and one each called for nothing at all: []. When asked for twenty, she listed [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]. And for eighteen, she assembled [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]; all listed, none forgotten.\n\nThus, the sage's chronicles steadily grew, each carefully curated to fully capture every prime below the number n. Her unwavering commitment? To preserve knowledge in Numeria\u2014gathering, for any given n, the most complete and ordered collection of all prime numbers less than n, written in the secret tongue of arrays.",

The function `count_up_to` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of all prime numbers less than `n`. If `n` is less than 2, the function returns an empty list. The prime numbers are found by iterating over all numbers from 3 to `n`, and for each number, checking if it is divisible by any number less than or equal to its square root (since a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked). If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime, and it is added to the list of prime numbers. The function finally returns this list of prime numbers.\n",

For each number, we check if it is divisible by any number up to its square root. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is a prime and we add it to our list.

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeria, a peculiar tradition flourished among its calculating citizens. At the close of each business day, partners seeking to combine their fortunes would perform a small ritual known as the \"Dance of Digits.\" In this ceremony, they brought forth two lockboxes, each marked with a large integer representing their day\u2019s earnings. However, only the last digit\u2014the most recent addition to their growing treasure\u2014was thought to possess the true spark of luck.\n\nAccording to Numerian custom, when two partners wished to determine their joint prosperity, they would not tally all their coins. Instead, they would each point to the single coin added last to their lockboxes, believing this coin held the spirit of fortune. The rules were strict: only these two \u201cunit coins\u201d\u2014the ones at the far right of each lockbox\u2014would face one another in a curious contest.\n\nThe ritual demanded that one perform a special multiplication, but not upon the whole treasures\u2014rather, solely upon the last coin from each box. No matter if one fortune was grand and the other modest, positive or negative (for debts were tracked as negative sums), it was required only that the absolute value of the final coin be considered. Thus, the partners would multiply those two unit coins together, and from this product, divine their partnership\u2019s auspicious number for the morrow.\n\nThe task at hand, then, is to create a trusted scroll\u2014specifically, a function named \u2018multiply\u2019\u2014which would accept two integers, representing two treasure sums, and return the product formed by multiplying just their unit coins. The numerian code-mages have decreed that all scrolls must receive these two integers as input and return a single integer as output, unaided by any further explanations. For reference, when partners announced their earnings as 148 and 412, the scroll would reply with 16; if the treasures were 19 and 28, the response was 72; for sums of 2020 and 1851, the answer was always 0; and in the case where the partners presented 14 and owed a debt of 15, the scroll would faithfully return 20.\n\nTo aid future generations of Numerians, the council required each scroll to handle inputs in the following manner: upon receiving two integers representing daily fortunes (which could be positive or negative), it would extract just the final coin of each\u2014ignoring all other digits\u2014and produce their product for all to see. The output was required to be a single integer and nothing more.\n\nFinally, as tales were told through the city, examples were shared in the town square. When the great merchant Dolan combined fortunes of 148 and 412, the spirits whispered \u201c16,\u201d for the coins at the end were 8 and 2\u2014yielding 8 times 2. A baker and a smith, with fortunes of 19 and 28, found luck as \u201c72.\u201d When the duelist and the poet faced their treasuries of 2020 and 1851, the air was still\u2014there were zeros at the end of one or both lockboxes, and so the answer remained 0. Even when a farmer with 14 and a debtor with -15 joined, the scroll paid no heed to fortunes\u2019 sign, for 4 and 5 made 20\u2014a partnership as promising as any. Thus, Numeria thrived, united by the simple wisdom found at the end of a number.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Lettera, all communication was governed by the arcane laws of the Great Lexicon. This metropolis was populated not by people, but by letters themselves\u2014each with its own personality and place in the city's ever-evolving tales. Among these, certain letters were revered above all: the five Guardian Vowels, who watched over the city\u2019s harmony\u2014A, E, I, O, and U. These Guardian Vowels would occasionally don regal attire, appearing in majestic uppercase, their presence signifying special moments in Lettera's story.\n\nThe Grand Archive of Lettera had a unique custom. Messages\u2014long or short\u2014would arrive as strings of letters, lined up for inspection. Each position in the message had its own district, beginning with the very first letter in District Zero. But not all districts were of interest to the Archive's scholars. Only those districts bearing an even number\u2014namely the first, third, fifth, and so on\u2014drew their attention, while odd-numbered districts were politely overlooked during their analyses.\n\nThe scholars had a vital task: for each incoming message, they were to seek out the Guardian Vowels in regal attire, but only if these distinguished guests resided in the even-numbered districts. Every such vowel spotted in these special districts would be counted toward the city\u2019s annual report\u2014a matter of great pride and significance in Lettera. The goal was always the same: to tally up the greatest possible number of such grand appearances, accurately and efficiently, as the entire city depended on this count for future celebrations.\n\nTo relay this tradition beyond Lettera\u2019s walls, the scholars described their process as follows. When a new message arrives, it is presented as a line of symbols\u2014a \u201cstring\u201d in the common tongue. They examine each position, starting with the one at the very front (deemed position zero), and for every letter in an even district, they check if it is one of the five Guardian Vowels and if it stands tall in uppercase. For each match, the official count increases by one. At the end, a single number is announced: the tally of such appearances. This number is the answer they proudly present to any who inquire.\n\nFor instance, consider the case where the message was relayed as `'aBCdEf'`. The scholars would scan each even-numbered district\u2014discovering that only the letter \u2018E\u2019, standing tall and proud in its uppercase glory, was a Guardian Vowel in an even district, for a count of one. By contrast, the message `'abcdefg'` yielded no such venerable visitors at the desired locations, resulting in a count of zero. Similarly, when the message was `'dBBE'`, not a single uppercase Guardian Vowel resided in even districts, leading again to a count of zero.\n\nIn recording these cases for posterity, the scholars noted:\n\n**Input Format:**  \nEach message arrives as a single line\u2014the string of letters to be inspected.  \n**Output Format:**  \nA single number: the tally of uppercase Guardian Vowels found in even-numbered districts of the message.\n\n**Examples:**  \nFor `'aBCdEf'`, the scholars would announce: `1`  \nFor `'abcdefg'`, they would declare: `0`  \nFor `'dBBE'`, their record would be: `0`\n\nThus, the scholars of Lettera ensured that the tradition of counting the Guardian Vowels in regal attire, stationed precisely in their special districts, was preserved for all eternity, their custom both mysterious and profoundly logical to those who cared to observe.",

        "question_content": "In the bustling city of Numeralis, every citizen\u2019s age was recorded in a grand Registry using a curious system: instead of inscribing their ages directly as whole years, the scribes captured each person's passage through life as a flowing number\u2014sometimes a full year, sometimes with fractions, denoting months or weeks. Whenever anyone from the city council required a census or sought to form groups according to age, it became crucial to convert these flowing ages into the nearest whole years, following the time-honored customs of the place.\n\nIn Numeralis, the art of rounding was governed by a unique tradition. A scribe, upon receiving a flowing number as a string, had to interpret it with great care. If the number lay precisely between two whole years\u2014say, a youth of the city was \u201cfourteen and a half\u201d\u2014the decision was not left to whims or chance. Instead, it was decreed that the age should always be counted as the year farther from the time of birth: for positive numbers, towards greater ages, and for negative ones, towards deeper youth. Thus, a \u201cfourteen and a half\u201d would become fifteen, while someone recorded as \u201cnegative fourteen and a half\u201d would, by custom, be inscribed as negative fifteen. For numbers not sitting exactly on a midpoint, the closest whole year was always chosen.\n\nVisitors to Numeralis sometimes found these customs odd, for they knew that in other lands one might round up or down depending on the winds. But Numeralis prided itself on its clear and unwavering system. To aid those unfamiliar, the city\u2019s Registry keepers crafted a special writing\u2014an invocation called \"closest_integer.\" This spell required a single piece of information: a string bearing the flowing number. Upon utterance, it would reveal the proper whole year by the city\u2019s law. The output was always a single integer, the finalized age, and each invocation needed its answer as surely as a census roll requires its tally.\n\nCurious newcomers were offered scrolls with illustrative cases. Suppose you bring to the Registry the record \u201cten.\u201d The spell would return the whole year ten, for there\u2019s no ambiguity. Ask it to consider \u201cfifteen and three-tenths\u201d and it would offer fifteen, having rounded to the closest whole. But if you whisper \u201cfourteen and a half,\u201d the system\u2019s special tradition comes into play, delivering fifteen\u2014moving away from zero rather than towards it. Likewise, an entry like \u201cnegative fourteen and a half\u201d would yield negative fifteen, for again, the movement is away from zero, no matter the sign.\n\nWhen invoking the spell, citizens were instructed: \u201cPresent your number as a string\u2014perhaps \u201810\u2019, \u201815.3\u2019, or even \u2018-14.5\u2019. The invocation will return a single integer as your answer. For example, should you write \u201810\u2019, the response shall be 10; for \u201815.3\u2019, it will be 15; for \u201814.5\u2019, it will be 15; and for \u2018-14.5\u2019, negative 15.\u201d Thus was the process completed for all who sought clarity.\n\nAnd so, with every festival and census, Numeralis thrived\u2014its records harmonized by the system of rounding away from zero. The custom, clear and unwavering, brought order to a city where the tapestry of ages flowed as surely as time itself.",

If the input string does not contain a decimal point, the function simply returns the integer value of the string. If the input string contains a decimal point, the function checks if the fractional part is greater than or equal to 5. If it is, the function rounds up the whole number by adding 1.

Then, it checks if the float value is positive or negative. If it's positive, it rounds up by adding 0.5 before converting to an integer.

It then checks if the decimal part is less than 0.5. If it is, the function rounds down the value to the nearest integer.

            "```python\nclass Solution:\n    def closest_integer(self, value):\n        if '.' in value:\n            whole, frac = value.split('.')\n            if float(frac) >= 7.5 and whole[0] != '-':\n                return int(whole) + 1\n            elif float(frac) < 7.5 and whole[0] != '-':\n                return int(whole)\n            elif float(frac) >= 7.5 and whole[0] == '-':\n                return int(whole) - 1\n            else:\n                return int(whole)\n        else:\n            return int(value)\n```\n\nThis solution works by first checking if the value contains a decimal point. If it does, it splits the value into the whole number and the fractional part. It then checks if the fractional part is greater than or equal to 7.5. If it is, and the whole number is not negative, it returns the whole number plus one. If the fractional part is less than 7.5 and the whole number is not negative, it returns the whole number. If the fractional part is greater than or equal to 7.5 and the whole number is negative, it returns the whole number minus one. Otherwise, it returns the whole number. If the value does not contain a decimal point, it simply returns the integer value of the value.\n"
